652,491,5,"When I used to work at a hardware store and my boss found out I like feeding birds, I was put in charge of the bird seed. But all we had then was just the basics; Wild bird seed and sunflower seed. The first thing I did was order in small bags of specialty seed like this. I knew that certain birds prefer certain seed and the filler seed that goes into cheap bird seed is just wasted by the birds.Scotts seed is one of the best on the market. It has the seeds the birds want and they have mixes for specific types of birds. This one is for smaller birds like Finches, Chickadees and my personal favorite, the Titmouse.Go ahead, get all the giggling out of your system, I'll wait.You good? Ok for those who don't know, the Titmouse is shaped like a bluejay, but is about a quarter the size and gray colored. But for a small bird, it can really sing. You know how they tell singers to project their voice? If you could project like a Titmouse, you wouldn't need a microphone or speakers.Another great thing about Scotts birdseed is the package. It has a spout with a screw on cap. No cutting, spilling as you pour and best of all, the seed is kept fresh when you seal it back up.Over all a great seed and package and it is available in multiple size to suit your feeding stations."
954,956,5,"I got this as a review sample and I honestly didn't expect to love it. I thought it might be ok, but I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is. This is a really handy and pretty accurate little thermometer. I don't do a lot of baking, but I do roast a lot of chickens (yard birds) and it is important to get that right. No one wants bloody chicken, but no one wants dried out chicken either. Free range chickens especially can dry out if not yanked out of the oven at the exact moment of perfection because they're not fattened up or pumped full of saline.This little thing gives you a clear readout and you don't have to wait around for the little needle to move around on the old fashioned round thermometer with the oven door open letting all of the heat out. This thing tells you PRONTO what the temp is, so you can get on with your life.I don't know what more to say other than it rinses clean, it seems to be very accurate and well made."
1602,874,4,"I have a coupleEarth Boxes I wasn't using, and this looked like a decent application.  As other reviewers have pointed out the set isn't cheap, but basically you are paying someone else to plant seeds in peat pots for you.  If you are an experienced hydroponicist, or have a large garden, you probably wouldn't give this a second glance anyway.  But if you're a container gardener with a busy schedule, this might be a fire-and-forget solution, we'll see - I only just got mine planted!The beauty of the process is how little time it takes.  Loosen up the soil in your container (I'd say at least seven inches of soil are called for,) peel the label off the pods, peel off the product info sticker UNDER the label (that couldn't've been one piece?!?) push the pod into the soil, scatter the little packet of plant food over all, and water.As others have pointed out, this would be worth more if it provided a bigger selection of herbs.  Maybe we'll see more options (and hopefully more reasonable prices) if the idea takes off.  As someone who owns an (attic-stored)AeroGarden, this approach is simple enough to be more than just a gimmick.  More on that in a couple months, when, hopefully, things have matured!UPDATE October 14 - The herbs did great; the tomatoes (and a pepper) STILL haven't quite matured.  That's partly my fault - we don't have a full-sun location in the yard and I got things started late.  However this just makes me reiterate what I said before - an herb garden version of this would be very convenient, maybe with some multi-bloom annuals throw in; zinnias and marigolds maybe (having something deer repellent would be a plus!)"
453,759,5,"The quality of manufacture and the east of set up are great with this product.  You can put it together to be ready to hit those nasty weeds in minutes.  Remember, don't throw away the bottle of oil that comes with this weed whip.  It is a great way to fill it and measure the mixture for filling with the gas and oil mixture.  Years ago, I grabbed the wrong gas for a gas powered whip and destroyed it.  Also, get extra line and have it on hand in advance so that when you run out you are prepared."
17,699,3,"For commercial spaces, like warehouses, these refillable bait stations are pretty effective, but for homeowners who just want something to get rid of the mouse family in your garage or attack, these are not the best choice.  They are messy, dangerous to pets, and are more trouble than other products.  For homeowners, I would recommend you consider the Spin TrapTomcat 100-33505-3 2-Count Mouse Snap Trapor a traditional mouse trap instead of this system."
1669,526,5,"We needed a new hummingbird feeder.  The old plastic one was cracking and fading and getty moldy in the hot backyard sun.  But a lot of the ones we'd see in home improvement and garden stores were pretty tacky-looking.  Not so the Perky-Pet 8108-2 Antique Bottle Glass Hummingbird Feeder.The 10-ounce antique-style textured green glass bottle sets it apart.  It's both classy and functional--easier to clean than plastic and a cinch to take apart and put together.Also especially decorative are the four metal feeder bases.  The feeder has an attached metal hanger that makes it easy to put up and take back down again whenever the nectar needs changing/refilling.Now all we need are the actual hummingbirds.  They can be pretty finicky, unforgiving little creatures and weren't very pleased with the condition of that old, plastic feeder."
1465,945,4,"I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends."
1054,416,4,"I'm a female who normally doesn't have any trouble putting things together without any help. But the industrial-sized bolts and cheap plastic-insert lock-nuts on this hose reel made it impossible to install the tires without finding someone to help me (I couldn't tighten the lock nuts). We ended up discarding the lock-nuts that came with this and buying a set of washers & lock-nuts made for a 5/8"" bolt at the hardware store in order to complete the assembly. I was happy that the hose connection doesn't leak, unlike the cheaper plastic hose reels I've owned in the past. Don't count on this holding 175 feet of hose like the description says....unless the hose is skinny, I'd guess the limit is closer to 150 feet of hose, if that."
990,232,2,"Bad news, made in China. Good news, well-made. Nice wide tread (width tapered 1"" to 1 5/8"") and textured to prevent your foot from slipping off. Blade (6"" x 4.5"" x 15"" long) welded to the oval steel shaft. Great ""D"" shaped handle (4 1/4"" x 8 1/4"" and screwed to steel shaft) at just the right angle for tough jobs. It is 47"" long and weighs 4 pounds. Nicely balanced. UPDATE/CAUTION: This spade has a problem with the way the handle is attached to the blade. It is not welded all of the way around allowing water to get inside if you wash off the blade. I did this and the next time I went to use the spade it was rusty in this area. I have found Fiskars to be a good company that stands behind its products, so I contacted them. I explained the problem and they immediately sent me another spade. I thought the defect might have been an isolated problem but the replacement has the same issue. I like to take care of my tools and this rusty defect is enough for me to downgrade my rating from 5 to 2 stars. Not recommended."
0,219,1,This is a certifiable piece of junk. It lacks sufficient power to cut anything.  Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery. I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job.
358,880,4,"This is the ""cutest"" hose ever.  I never dreamed I would own a purple hose!  It is light, delivers just as much pressure as my expensive rubber hoses and far more than the hoses I own that claim ""no more kinking"".  The only thing it is not good at is use with a sprinkler.  Apparently the pulse action of my sprinkler heads affects the hose pressure and the hose tends to creep back to a smaller length dragging the sprinkler along.  The first time I used it to water my veggie garden it ended up squirting in my back window because of that movement.  Not good!Otherwise, it is so much easier to use and to store and to carry around wherever needed.Highly recommended"
150,702,4,"I'm going to still give this four stars because I know for a fact the Craycort products are very good. The problem in my case is Craycort shipped it to someone else and I never got it! They refused to acknowledge their error but Amazon fully reimbursed me. However, despite what Craycort did or their very poor attitude about it, that's no reason for me to trash the product. Just make sure you purchase it from someone other than directly from Craycort."
1617,936,5,This potting mix worked great for me. All my seeds came up great!  I also repotted a few existing plants and used this and they are looking better than ever.This soil holds moisture very well; it takes a long time to dry out. It's a sizable bag and the price isn't bad. The texture is good and at least in the batch I got there were not big pieces of wood as mentioned in a few other reviews.This makes starting seeds easy and I still have plenty of soil left from my initial projects which is great.
421,223,4,"I bought these to try them out for starting some plants indoors. They seem to be working good, no problems with growing.The main problem I had was I didn't get the full 100. I've contacted Amazon and they gave a partial refund. I've also contacted the company about the issue."

1594,619,5,"I gave my 82 year-old mother a hummingbird feeder and this 3 pack of food for Christmas.  What do you give someone who has everything she needs?  She mixed the food, poured it into the feeder and I hung it in the crepe mrytle tree in the front yard.  Within 2 hours she had hummingbirds feeding from it!!!!!!  Good Stuff!!!"
175,621,4,"This is a perfectly nice and functional umbrella.  I like the auto-tilt feature by just cranking a bit harder past ""open"".Be aware that the crank is a thin plastic.  The ball on top is plastic (and looks to be poorly molded - there is a huge seam where the two pieces of the mold came together).  The slats are also plastic.  There is very little metal at all here.  The pole (both sections) are light weight metal that looks to be powder-coated.The umbrella fabric is a nice color - as expected - it is a tiny bit on the shiny side.  It is not a matte canvas look.This umbrella operates fine and has held up to a couple of decent rain and wind storms (including a big one this weekend!)  I will be pleased if it lasts a couple of seasons.  I don't expect this to last for many years.  Maybe I'll be surprised.I'll update this review if necessary."
631,137,5,I have tried several hummingbird feeders and while I've only had this one a few days it should be great.  It comes apart easily.  The liquid goes in the bottom section so nothing has to be turned upside down for filling which should eliminate sugar water dripping.  It even has a built in ant trap in the middle.
1374,41,5,"For most yard trimming this pruner is great.  Easy to adjust, cuts limbs like butter, and is light.  I have the 12 foot model also, but for most yard trimming this one is perfect.  I have used it to trim low limbs on my Silver Maples, a variety of yard shrubs, my Magnolia trees, and woody stemmed weeds.  Anyone can use this one. Great trimmer."
1363,443,4,"This sprinkler earns high marks for being built to last.  I have gone through many sprinklers that ultimately fail due to cheap construction, failure of moving parts, or water deposits.  This sprinkler has no moving parts whatever; I expect it to work as well in fifty years as it does today.  Here are some observations based on my experience:*  Durability - This unit is made from cast iron.  It is therefore heavy and stays where planted.  It tends to want to remain flat on the ground and is more resistant to tilting due to hose twist or stiff grass than lighter plastic sprinklers.  The finish is yellow and has lasted well so far.  Being iron, I reckon rust may be an issue to its innards if left wet for a while, but you would really have to let it soak for that to affect functionality.*  Pattern - The square hole on top of the sprinkler does a reasonably good job of creating a square watering pattern.  I have noticed with mine, however, that it sprinkles significantly more to one side. (to the left, facing the hose inlet side)  Front to back coverage seems about equal.*  Coverage - This has been less than advertised, in my experience.  I'm on city water here, with very good pressure and flow.  It still covers a decent area, but I would count on it covering 20 - 25 feet square, rather than 30.*  Effectiveness - Unlike some sprinklers, this one tends not to create a fine mist that can get carried away by a light breeze - good for keeping water where you want it.  The flow is good for quick watering, and it produces large droplets.  While the unit sits low to the ground - it's about two inches high - the water emits from the center and not the sides, reducing the likelihood of tall grass obstructing the water.*  What it's good for - it is ideal for straight-sided lawns in the 'burbs that do not exceed the reach of the sprinkler, from narrow parking strips to front or back yards.  For my relatively narrow but long front yard, I put the sprinkler at one end and just pull it along to the next section when the first part's been watered enough.  As I mentioned, it is heavy enough to stay flat and not flip over so I don't have to turn the water off to re-position it.*  Where it's made - For those who care about this kind of thing, it is made in China.  From a manufacturing and quality point of view, I don't think this matters a whit in the case of this sprinkler.*  Value - I think this is priced reasonably and represents decent value for a sprinkler that you can count on never failing.  It may be had cheaper at a local big box store, but I have yet to see this model locally.So while I really like this sprinkler, I give it four stars rather than five due to a lower coverage than expected and the fact that the area does not get covered quite equally. (which, admittedly, is the challenge of any sprinkler)  Also, though I think the price is reasonable it still could be a bit less in my view.  Solid product."
751,538,5,Just like the rest of the reviews say; this stuff just works. Just remember the ratios on the bottle are MAXIMUM amounts. I've found 1/2 strength to work best.FloraBloom is amazing. Period.
1234,853,5,"This is an attractive addition to a country kitchen or any sunny windowsill that is wide enough. The planter is narrow and seems steady, so it wouldn't need much space. The wooden boxes come lined with plastic liners that will probably last a year if you plant directly into them. I imagine you can find some system for protecting the wooden boxes once the plastic liners wear out, but it would be nice if the manufacturer offered refill liner sets."
1231,383,5,"This was easier to replace then I imagined.  I removed the old one , cleaned the entire BBQ and then installed the new one. No adjustments or worries at all."
1458,462,4,"I used this to irrigate our landscaped plants over the summer and works nicely.  It was easy to cut with a utility knife (i.e box cutter).  Just be aware that the tubing is very rigid so plan accordingly.  I don't know if this was by design to withstand temperate fluctuation but you'll need to plan just a single slight bend (or curve) on the line.  It won't take more than that.  One advice, you'll need to use a flame to soften the plastic on the opening before attaching it to whatever you are connecting to.  Otherwise you'll have to use a lot of pressure to make it fit."
1048,26,5,"Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly)."
1607,903,4,"It took me a few minutes of tinkering to figure out how to get the spreader operational.  The instructions were a little hard for me to comprehend and some of the pieces were difficult to move.  Basically, you are twisting the bottom of the container and it pops off.  It feels like you are breaking it, but you are not.  Once I was able to get the container open and the battery installed, it was really easy to use.  If you look at the picture, the yellow thing on the bottom is the on off switch and the fertilizer comes out the bottom front.  It was very easy to use.  I have a very complex yard with a variety of landscaping.  I wanted to apply this only to the grassy areas and had no problem limiting it to those areas and avoiding the flowers and shrubs that I wanted to use a different mix on.  As I said in the summary, this particular mix is very high nitrogen and almost nothing else.  Depending on what your lawn needs, this might or might not be a good solution.  However, the package is designed so you can use it over and over with whatever fertilizer you want to use.  For this, I give it 4 stars!"
132,126,5,"MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS.  I STATED THAT IT WAS CHEAPLY MADE BUT FAIR FOR THE PRICE.  WITHOUT SOLICITATION FROM ME, THE COMPANY WROTE ME AND FOLLOWED UP.  PRETTY AMAZING AS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS, NOT TOO BAD.  BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE A COMPANY WHO WORKS THIS HARD TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT. HAVE BEEN USING THE FEEDER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS FINE."
100,669,4,"This pair of scissors definitely lives up to the Fiskars high reputation. If you watched the promotional video, I can tell you the scissors truly do almost everything shown.I do say almost: I have three problems with the scissors.1) The box opener/tape opener was not great, in my opinion.2) Using the pull-apart blade as a knife is handy, but it's a bit awkward to hold safely. Maybe I could get used to it, but I'm not sure I'd want to.3) I very much dislike the bottle opener. It makes pulling the scissors out of their case difficult and potentially painful. I can imagine how some people would find it useful, but it isn't to me - it's just in the way.Having gotten those negatives out of the way, though, let me take a minute to just rave about everything else.-The scissors truly can bounce back and forth from cutting fabric to cutting cardboard and plastic, to small branches, and back to fabric. Having been trained from early in life that a pair of scissors is ruined for fabric as soon as it touches paper, this is a HUGE deal to me.-The awl amazed me. I didn't have leather to try, but it pierced thick cardboard as if it were putty! Perfect for starting holes!-The twine and wire cutters also definitely work as advertised, smoothly and cleanly.-Being able to take the scissors apart for cleaning is another great plus, allowing them to truly remain multi-purpose even after an especially dirty job.This product is definitely worth every penny. I might even need a second pair..."
724,908,4,"i love injecting the meats with a bit of extra flavor or beer to keep them extra moist, but i do prefer a clear tank so i can see how much juice i'm putting. that being said, this is way WAY more sturdy than some other products i've tried and i also enjoy the dual injection options. i can use the straight injector for concentrated flavor or the perforated injector for a wide spread of juice. very well made and durable.~I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review~"
400,842,4,"While rooting hormones are not absolutely necessary, they do give your cuttings a better chance of survival. And it is so easy to use. Just dip the cutting in the hormone powder and plant it into a pot. My cuttings do seem to do better when I use rooting hormone.This bottle is inexpensive and will last through a lot of cuttings."
1168,715,5,"This is a &#34;Tier 1&#34; bait station.  Tier 1 means that it is kid and pet resistant. It's not kid proof or pet proof, so common sense needs to be used.  If your Husky wants in, it can get in. Then again, they can also shred coffee cans. I place mine in areas  where it's difficult for kids or pets to get to, or are not allowed.  A corner in the garage behind a paint can, etc. If I really need one in the house, I'll look for mouse signs and hide it - away from prying eyes or pet teeth. Your cat is not getting in this thing. Neither is a small dog or a toddler. But common sense should prevail - it's a poison and should be treated as such.Kills off mice pretty quick - I use it as a preventative and have one near the garage door and deck entrance."
327,577,3,"Ok, so every year when the weather gets cooler we get mice in our house. We live out in the country, so it is unavoidable. I saw this little contraption and thought it sounded like a decent product to trap the mice and me not have to deal with them or see them. Usually I use the glue traps and then you have to throw a live mouse stuck on glue in the trash and it just seems so wrong. So anyway, I gave these Kill and Seal traps a try. I put 2 of them back in my bathroom closet where I had seen some mouse droppings and I also saw the darn mouse itself one day when it darted out of the closet when I opened the door. I am not sure why, but the mouse must be avoiding this trap because there are still mouse droppings but no mouse in the trap! There are droppings literally right beside the trap too, so I am not sure what is going on or where this mouse came from that he is so dang smart. Weird!! I guess I will go back to the glue traps since we always catch the mice that way."
662,286,4,All of the local birds I've been feeding for years seem to like this seed.  Mixed with additional sunflower seed keeps the feeders active.
284,271,5,Squirrels are beyond crafty and will figure out ways to get to any feeder if they can. Brome is the least likely for them to figure out how to thief from.
1272,585,5,I have become so disappointed with the Home Depot Sprayers. They just don't hold up. I have owned this one for about 6 months and it works as wekk as the day I bought it.
1614,66,4,"I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!"
153,794,4,"What I Like ~ This is a sturdy & quality made feeder, and the level of liquid can easily be seeneven through the rich red color of the glass.The hanger is made of  heavy metal wire, & four flowers on the top side of the base (the feeding ports)give a rich appearance against the copper finished metal cap.The bottom of the base is made of plastic. The total height is 11 1/4"".This feeder has a rich appearance, and is the most attractive one we've owned.It seems we only have a few birds coming to our feeder, so this 24 oz is larger then we need.But I'll fill it approx 1/4 full and that's about right to last and stay fresh,for the approx 3 days before the time comes to empty, clean, & provide fresh food.What I Don't Like ~ As for ease of use, I was disappointed to find the inside opening of the topis only 5/8"" diameter, and requires a funnel when filling.It's 10"" deep to the inside bottom of the bottle, so this feeder isn't going to be very easy to clean.I purchased a bottle sponge specially for clean hummingbird feeders,but it's difficult to push through the top even when wet, and lacks 2"" of reaching the bottom.My regular bottle brush with the little cotton ball on top, will go through the opening,but it also lacks 2"" of reaching the bottom.I have a good variety of bottle sponge/brushes but none will clean this feeder.This product is likely, only going to get shaken for a cleaning, which is NOT what I prefer.The tag says to hand wash with soap & water twice a week, & for extra cleaning use vinegar & water.The hanger is of strong quality, but is somewhat close to the glass, - 1"".If one isn't quick about the ""tipping to the side & hooking motion"", an 'S' hook may help.Four stars because of poor design for cleaning, which greatly subtracts from enjoyment."
738,807,4,"I installed this in a detached greenhouse. It is lightweight and keeps the air moving. It is a tad noisy but that is not an issue since it is not in a living space. Essentially a no frills version, this fan does not have adjustable speed, it is either on or off. The power cord is short, be prepared to use an extension cord or position near an available plug. For a low end fan, it is simple and effective. Recommended."
906,939,5,"Can't say a whole lot about a humingbird feeder other that it seems to work.The birds are just now starting to show up around here (SW Idaho), but the ones that are around love it.Two key features that I'm really liking is how easy and fast it is to clean and the large capacity glass bottle (it's not going to yellow like the plastic ones).But so far, so good. Haven't had any leakage issues or any insects making their way into the feeder either."
1628,33,5,"Had a possum.  Put this out with some dog food and caught it in less than 3 hours.  I had an animal guy come out, couldnt catch the possum and try and charge me $500.  Way easier, cheaper and faster"
715,255,3,"I don't understand what's in this.  The bottle isn't very clear. Says it's Zinc Phosphate but is that toxic to gophers? I've avoided using gopher baits with strychnine as it can also kill birds, and other wildlife.It does seem to work but I would be more comfortable knowing what exactly the ingredients are."
1273,167,4,"This works as well for me as other deer sprays and was much easier to use.  I know from my own and other research that you have to change the deer sprays every few weeks. Throwing the deer off balance by introducing strange new smells is important.  I have some issues with my hand and it was great to not have to squeeze the trigger to cover my extensive gardens.  I will continue to use this, will buy more, and will refill the first bottle with another brand.The label says it can last for three months, which sounds great.  However, in smaller print it says to reapply after a heavy rain.  Maybe some of you live in an area where it does not rain or you don't use a watering hose for three months, but I don't.  It also says it is made ineffective by freezing.  It doesn't say if it is referring to the bottle of solution or after it is applied to the plant (maybe both).Again, it works as well as other sprays, but the other sprays don't make such claims."
1664,217,5,"The clips that hold this container together when collapsed are superior to the competition's toggles and the less rigid stance allows it to be used with a 33-gallon bag as well as a larger one without the bag pulling off the rim.  When a larger bag is used and the container is getting full, you can pull it up to its full height so it holds more than it appears it will at first.  This makes it more versatile and my son-in-law, the recipient of the gift, could immediately see many uses, from tailgate parties and camping, to inside uses, as well as yard waste collection, its advertised function.  I can say that it was immediately put to use to contain Christmas wrapping paper, discarded gift boxes, etc., and did a fine job of keeping our gift exchange area tidy.  After that, it contained a couple of grandchildren during play, then helped haul all the booty to the car.  It was definitely a hit.I had to laugh at another reviewer's comment about the smaller 30-gallon Fiskars product being for 'grandma'.  Well, I am grandma and I bought the 30-gallon unit for myself, so he's right.  This unit is more commodious, but still stores in a small space when collapsed.  It's going to get a lot of use both inside and out."
75,446,5,I used these on a few different types of plants and it helps them grow.  I should probably use it more often instead of regular water and just kind of go back and forth between water and miracle grow.

1049,777,4,"I'm not a big fan of Perky-Pet bird feeders.  They're usually cheaply made out of too much plastic and aren't squirrel-proof, even when advertised as such.  Not surprisingly, the Panorama is part plastic, has some cheaply made parts and is definitely not squirrel-proof.  What is surprising is how much the birds and I really like this feeder.  It has many redeeming features.The Panorama is made out of well-constructed metal.  The two chambers hold an ideal amount of seed, a total of 4.5 lbs--seeds move quickly, but don't require daily refilling.  Yes, the tube chamber is plastic, but it does a good job of keeping out bad weather and preventing moisture problems.  The circular trays that hold exposed seed have drain holes beneath them to further reduce seed spoilage.  So many feeders nowadays are tube style, but they typically have very few feeding ports or are surrounded by caged wires, only allowing little bird access.  This one offers two wide circular metal feeding rings.  How nice to see a large variety and number of birds feeding simultaneously.Perky-Pet needs to test their products in hard-core squirrel country.  Where there's a will, there's a way, and squirrels around here are experts at draining and destroying.  The cap on this feeder does offer a lock system of sorts, but it is flimsy.  Just a matter of time before I break the little plastic pieces off or the squirrels do.  There's nothing to stop squirrels from lazily wrapping themselves around a tray and gorging themselves either.  That's why I've located the Panorama off an old basketball hoop--no squirrel can reach it.  With a little care on my part, this feeder hopefully will last a long time.If you don't have squirrel problems, I highly recommend this universal feeder.  It does not selectively keep out any bird, is esthetically pleasing to look at and its cost is within every birder's budget."
998,516,5,I am going to have to pick up more of this soon. my birds look forward to it every spring and will come to my window if my feeder is empty. This is a natural no color added food and it must be Good !

1232,807,4,"I didn't particularly have a ventilation issue that I was hoping to address with this fan, but I do have a one story home that sprawls a bit, so I had a notion that locating this fan in front of the master bedroom (the room farthest from the HVAC unit) would probably give the room a heating and cooling boost. When I opened the box, however, there were no instructions. That's fine, because I  guess you just open up a duct and insert this between the ends you open up and away you go. But that brings us to the next problem: this plugs in and doesn't have a switch. My ducts run through the crawl space, where there are no electrical outlets. On top of that, without cutting a hole in the floor, there would be no access to turn it off and on by plugging and unplugging it. So, in order to be able  to use this, I'd have to do some major electrical work and have to come up with some way to be able to reach it without having to go outside and crawl around under the flooring. Since, as I said, I don't really have a ventilation issue, I decided to cut my losses and leave it uninstalled. I'll tell you though, when I plugged it in this thing blows a very powerful stream of air and is pretty quiet, so for someone who is handy with electrical and HVAC work, this will be an easy and effective solution to boost airflow in a home. If you're an average guy like me, you'll have to call someone to install it for you."
722,138,4,"This piece of equipment does a respectable job of keeping at least a little part of the surface of the bird-bath free of ice during the winter.  Once the temps get down close to zero F., there's not much open water left for the thirsty birdies, but it has never allowed the surface to totally freeze over."
1517,612,5,"Our shower stall is four foot by five foot with a one foot by four foot bench.  The angle of the base drain causes it to drain very slowly.  Between the size and the slow drain, it has to be dried to avoid growing unpleasant things.  We've used a top brand squeegee and it takes a while and does an okay job.  We picked up the Karcher Cordless Window & Flat Surface Wet Vac to see if it could speed up and/or do a better job.  I'm pleased to say that it does both - a faster and better job of drying the shower.The 20 minute battery life was more than enough to get the entire job done.  Due to the size of the shower, I had to empty the reservoir one halfway through the process - not a big deal as I just emptied it down the shower drain.  After two long hot showers, the Karcher made the walls feel dry to the touch after one quick pass.Due to the slow drain mentioned above, there was more water on the shower floor than the reservoir could hold, so I turned it off and used it as a regular squeegee to push the majority of the water to the drain and then turned it on and dried up the remaining water.  While drying the floor, I noticed that while holding the unit at a certain angle, some water squirted out of the vents at the back of the unit.  I solved this by changing the angle slightly.I plan to use the unit every night and recommend it highly for the purpose of drying the shower.  I haven't used it on our windows, so I can't speak to that function."
768,434,3,"The aesthetics of this bird feeder are awesome.  It really is beautiful to look at.  Some parts of it are plastic rather than metal but I didn't see that as a huge issue.As others have pointed out there are not drainage holes in either silo and I think the rationale was being able to fill both with water (the box advertises being able to fill both with water, both with seed, or one of each).  Ours is on our porch, but I could definitely see the rain ruining seed and causing problems out in the open.The other problem I had was filling it.  Even with the closed setting there is substantial spillage of both water and seed.  I think the manufacturers knew that because in the instructions it says to fill the feeder near where you're hanging it.  It would have been great if they'd made it a little more airtight."
1352,121,5,"For years my family has relied upon the original old-fashioned wooden mousetraps to catch any mice that might be roaming around.  Recently, it seems that the mice are becoming smarter because they eat the cheese & peanut butter clean off the trap without setting them off. After this happened a few times, I decided to try to find a better mousetrap and came across this SNAP-E MOUSE TRAP.The trap works on exactly the same principles as the old wooden traps.  You place the bait in the middle of the trap and pull the spring back to set it.  The difference is that the trap has an incredibly strong spring.  Because of this, the trap is made of a sturdy plastic.These traps are incredible!  There's no chance of the vermin licking the trap clean because the trap is very sensitive.  Also, with the powerful spring on the trap, they are killed instantly.I have tried using other types of traps before, but these SNAP-E MOUSE TRAPS are by far the best mousetraps to catch & kill a mouse with.  Highly recommended."

545,577,4,"Anyone that has a mouse problems knows what a hassle it can be to track down, catch, and dispose of them is.This mouse trap seeks to elimate most of the nastiness that comes with the territory once the mouse is caught. It that sense it's a good mouse trap. When a mouse is in there you never have to see it, touch it, or anything. Just pick up the trap and toss it.Not bad, however, the one problem I had is a fresh trap (one right out of the box) had a certain 'new' smell to it that kept the mice away. Once the smell was gone and new bait put in they worked quickly and effectively.If you don't mind the traditional mouse traps they stick with those, however if you don't want to see the mouse post-capture this will certain be an enticing product for you.In the end it worked out just fine for me."
1208,506,5,"The ""Strathwood Coco Fiber Closed Boxes"" Doormat is well made and fairly attractive for what it is. We live in the county and need a good doormat to prevent dirt and mud from being tracked into the house, this mat should work nicely. Here are my observations:* It is a good size (18"" x 30""), but is a little bit on the light side for it's size.* Made from recycled rubber and coco fibers, it has sturdy stitching and should hold up for a few years.* The coco fibers are fairly high, with a good bit of channeling between them to provide a lot room for dirt, mud, and water to fall away from cleaning surface.This doormat looks great on my porch and does a good job with cleaning thick dirt and mud off shoes and boots.*** UPDATE 02/02/2011: Going on two years of daily use and this mat still looks and works great! Upgrading my review from 4 to 5 stars.Recommended!CFH"
1625,481,5,"I hate mice in my house with an unholy passion. I loathe the little creatures with a burning passion but they still manage to get into the house.I don't like ""regular"" traps. Snap traps don't always make a clean, painless kill, glue traps are just plain cruel and poison not only makes them suffer, they can expire in really inconvenient places and present a danger to your pets if they find a carcass before you do.I first started using electronic traps about 10 or so years ago. Back then, all I could find was a model meant for rats, but it worked great. I discovered Victor electronic traps back in 2009 and have bought a bunch of them since.This particular model has been updated to accomodate up to three 'guests' and their departure from this mortal coil is rapid and (most likely) painless. Certainly more so than old-school traps.I like that there's a little light on top to tell me when the trap needs emptying and that I just have to flip it open and dump the contents into a trash can. It's also quite easy to bait. I use a smear of peanut butter near the deepest part of the trap and so far, I caught two mice in one night.I'm a huge fan of these traps and have pretty much all of the logical paths in the house covered.Highly recommended."

1583,425,3,"Easy to assemble, but not sure I'd want to leave this outside all summer without a cover on it for some protection during storms.  The fabric seems to be pretty thin, although it is definitely cooler sitting under it.  It's a market umbrella, meaning at the very top there is a separate layer of material that sits over the other, allowing for some ventilation and should handle better in the wind.  This model does not come with a tilt adjustment.At just under 5 feet 4 inches, I'm not tall enough to raise or lower the umbrella even when standing on the patio blocks; an inch or two too short.  I need a step stool.It was a little breezy out today.  Just enough to make the open umbrella move around a lot.  It dips, spins and will even cause the arm to twist.  Not bad, just a little weird at first, although I definitely wouldn't want it open if the wind was any higher.  I went in for a while with the umbrella still up.  When I came out again later with a step stool to lower it, the umbrella was still expanded, but the arm was no longer locked in the upright position and had slid all the way down.  I'm assuming all of the bouncing around from the wind caused it to unlock.  Hope this doesn't become an issue."
850,636,3,"Ok, being a man, I typically set the instructions aside and try to figure it out first, THEN refer to the instructions if I get stuck.  somewhere along the line, I lost the instructions and I was surprised how difficult this thing was.  It's also tough to read the digital screen while you bending down when it is installed on the hose spigot, as you have to be pretty much looking straight at it to see the readout.  I have pretty much given up on setting up the auto portion (that's my lazy fault though, and not the product) but it worked for awhile.  I pretty much just use the 'manual' setting now, because I'm lazy.  to get 5 stars, it would need an easier to read digital screen and be more durable.  it's pretty expensive for what you get."

652,780,5,"A coiled up water hose may be expected in the garden, but on your patio it can be a mess or even an accident waiting to happen. This hose holder is perfect for when you need your hose near, but want it out of sight. Run one end thru the hole on the bottom and coil the rest inside. And the best part is the beehive design makes it very easy to coil it back inside.And this hose holder isn't limited to just hoses, the center piece can be removed and it can be use to hold other items; blankets, recyclables or toys. It also can be used as a decorative pot for you larger house plants. Not that there is a matching lid, but it is sold separately.Overall this is a very durable, solid steel storage box with an excellent copper finish."
400,229,4,"There is a neighborhood cat that likes to use our yard as its litter box. I have been very frustrated by this problem for a long time. A few weeks ago I sprinkled some of this stuff in the areas I have seen the cat hang out and so far so good. I haven't seen any evidence of the cat leaving its ""calling card"" in our yard. I like the convenience of this product. The granular pellets are easy to scatter around the yard. I don't have to deal with a messy, smelly liquid that I have to spray all over the yard. I just grab a handful of this stuff and scatter it around. Couldn't be any easier. It has yet to be determined how effective it will be over the long run. I will update my review when more time has passed. Like most other animal deterrent products, you have to reapply after heavy rains. The biggest drawback of this product is the price. Hopefully the price will come down and make it more affordable."
1008,691,5,This is NOT a heavy duty chain saw.  It IS a perfect addition to an already existing arsenal of power tools.  If a branch here and a prune there may be required then this is the saw for that job.  Do not think that it would cut the winter's supply of wood.  I have several trees that demand a branch's removal in a high location.  I prefer working from the ground and not on a ladder.  I want to be in a location that I can move away from my mistake when it takes place.  Having a tree fall on my head a few years ago leads me to this conclusion.  The head is light enough to extend the pole to the maximum distance from the ground and with a 20 volt lithium ion battery it will work for more than a few minutes.One element I especially like is that with the included 20 volt battery I now have a supply of 5 of them.  My storage area is full of Black & Decker 20 volt power tools and when one runs out of power it is a simple matter to remove it from the tool and insert a fully charged one.  I have yet to run out of battery power before I ran out of human power.  That has more to do with old age rather than powerful batteries.  Regardless this tool is so handy I have it ready to cut all the time.  Between this and the hedge trimmer (same battery configuration) I am ready to trim any and all the time.
1364,466,4,"Used to see so many of these type replacement trimmer units sold on TV and always figured they were junk.Now they all seem to be gone from the marketplace except for two types that I found, I bought this one because it uses plain heavy duty .095 trimmer line and not special made blades that might be hard to find at some point.This can be set up to use 2 or 4 sections of line (bent double to be 4 or 8) I've been using it with only 2(4) so far and it works at least as well as my old stock unit that kept needing repairs and wasting line.Cutting pretty well, but makes the engine seem to run a bit slower and I feel the need to give it more throttle.I might try it with all 4 lines at some point to see if there is an improvement in cut, but happy as is and saves line too. (8 lines in use after you fold them over and insert) not sure what all 4(8) lines will do to the RPM range however, might not let my engine come up to full speed.This same item is also sold under the ""Rino-Tuff"" brand, but made by the same company.Check the pre cut replacement string package, for just a dollar or so more you can get 100ft of .095 line and cut 100 pcs pretty quick.Was quick and easy to install and has given no trouble so far with a few hours of cutting with it. (still the same line that came with the unit)They claim 20x the life for the line, but who knows.. even if it gets the same life per foot as the old coil loaded in, it's still easier to deal with no mechanical parts and uses low cost rolls of line.On the subject of line life, one thing to keep in mind is that when you do wear line it is not replaced by more from a spool so just gets shorter and shorter.. how long will you keep using it at it's shortest length before you put in new line?  A variable that will cause owners to report different findings on line wear times I'm sure.Claims to fit 99% of the gas trimmers out there, but no way one person can know if this is true.  Does come with a good assorment of sizes for nuts and bolts to fit what you have though.No way to know how this will hold up, but time will tell and I'll be back to say if it didn't do well 8-)NOTE;  Be sure to read the comments attached to this review before you buy"
1605,959,5,"Bright white light does a decent job of lighting up your grill surface.  Position of the LEDs (two round clusters of five bulbs each) work to diminish shadows.

To install the batteries you need a tiny Philips head screwdriver to remove the battery compartment cover.  Most everyone will have a tiny screwdriver like this, except maybe for those just starting out with any empty tool box.

209,622,4,I have used Beer in a tuna can buried level to the ground for years to control the slugs in my Hosta plants.  The draw back to this is the need to keep emptying the dead slugs and refill with fresh beer.  We recently took a 4 week vacation and I applied Dr. T's Slug & Snail Killer before we left because I would not be able to keep my beer bait regimen  while I was gone.  We returned to minimal damage to the Hosta leaves.  I set out my beer bait cans again and there were only a few slugs in the cans in the morning.  Evidently the Dr. T's Slug & Snail Killer has reduced the slug population in our absence.
1296,669,5,"Bridging the gap between household and garden tools these multi-purpose scissors do a fine job at pretty much every function offered. I do wonder though why some functions are there especially the bottle opener. I mean, it's a nice feature that works fine but it just seems less utilitarian than say the rope or wire cutter. I guess after a hard day cutting wire, herbs, twine, thread, flowers, straps, rope and opening bags and boxes (all taken from the Fiskars scissors advertisement!) you need to be able to open a strong bottle of nice libation to reward yourself.In all seriousness, these scissors and extremely sturdy and work exceedingly well at all the functions it promises. Even the sheath is useful as it acts as both a protector and has a built in sharpener and box cutter. The scissors can be separated without any tools or adjustment for cleaning and are even dishwasher safe.This inexpensive multi-function scissors should be in everyone's kitchen utility draw."
603,359,5,"I had lower back disk fusion surgery 3 months ago. In my post-surgical state I have trouble bending and lifting heavy objects. But I can work the Toro Power Shovel! I bought it with low expectation, thinking that either it will not work well or that I will have trouble with it due to my current physical limitation. Surprisingly, neither concern materialized. Toro easily chopped through 10 inch snow bank left from 18 inches that fell a few days ago, and I was able to push it through the snow as well as move it up and down the stairs to the house. In some areas I was able to push it one handed which was an easier position on my back, and sometimes I needed the second hand to get through a tougher spot. The handle is adjustable so with the highest position I don't have to bend too much.Wet snow update:I am updating this review after the first wet snow. Toro power shovel handled it well! It was a little harder to push, but I found that I could brace the handle on my thigh and that allowed me to push with my leg rather than my injured back. Then it was easy!The hardest thing to deal was not the show shovel itself, but the 100 feet of electric cord, which was heavy, unwieldy and became almost unmanageable to coil back, especially when it became cold and covered with snow. The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control. Putting back the cord tired me out more than shoveling itself.I found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin (see picture). This way when I bring the shovel in and the snow melts I will not have a puddle on the floor. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (see picture).This product is build for a right-handed person.Update:I found a solution for an electric cord winding - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review"
946,85,5,"Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed, I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old, thick branches.)"
1495,772,5,"This trimmer is darn powerful. In fact, it cuts thru grass better than my Troy Bilt gas trimmer.  It also weighs a lot less. I always wear a chainsaw helmet with built in face protection when I operate tools like these. Husqvarna makes a nice and inexpensive hard hat with a face protector that you can buy on Amazon. The reason I mention this is that I did not install the plastic shield at the bottom of the trimmer. So face protection is a must. Landscape contractors never use the lower guard because it limits the agility of the tool. I saw a lot of complaints about the line feed mechanism....specifically the trimmer line sticking together. This is simple to solve....just spray the line spool with some WD40 and reinstall. This eliminates line sticking together."
1284,956,4,"Compared this to a very similarTaylor 9842 Commercial Waterproof Digital Thermometerthat we have.  Really, the only thing that the Taylor has over this one is the NSF certification, which can actually be pretty important.  This Gogodu does NOT state that it is NSF certified.  As far as temperatures, Gogogu and the NSF certified Taylor were always with 0.6 degrees (F) of each other.  However, NSF certifies not just the measurement, but also that the design meets the standards for being able to clean (from my vantage, this Gogogu is just as cleanable as the Taylor.)  The one thing that I can't vouch for is that NSF would have verified is that it is non-toxic, durable and resistant to corrosion.  Time will tell for the latter two, I'll just hope this sucker isn't toxic.So, from my ""layman's"" perspective on this thermometer, it's great...but having the NSF certification would have made it even nicer.  All in all, this appears to be a good all-around product.  Lastly, as far as being waterproof - both this one and my Taylor say they are waterproof.  I take this to mean that I can get a soapy sponge, clean the entire thing, rinse it off, and move on...and they both work fine with that.  I don't (and have no plans to) put these into a sink of soapy water, nor a dishwasher...Disclaimer:  I received this product free of change from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review."
820,260,4,"While I normally use peanut butter, I thought I would try this product out to see how it compares.  It is very easy to use as it is just a matter of squeezing the tube and the goo comes out to be placed on the trap.  So far, no mice have bitten the traps with the gel, but I am sure in time they will.  An old jar of peanut butter may be a lot cheaper, but using this one can keep his hands clean."
1626,634,5,"OK so what I REALLY want is to convert our deck into a conservatory that you can remove the glass from in summer and replace with screening.  That isn't too much to ask, is it?  (If you're a movie-star, it isn't!)So until I become rich and famous, I ordered this to make our summer outdoor meals a little more pleasant.  I only expected it to keep the bugs off, but I was pleasantly surprised at how it also improved the ambiance of my little outdoor dinette set.  The black color of the screening makes it feel SO much cooler under the umbrella.  Maybe it actually IS cooler (I'll have to test that with a thermometer sometime!) but it really feels much less like you're being blasted by late-afternoon sun.I haven't had the problems other reviewers had with the water bladder around the bottom leaking.  This may be because I didn't fill it very full - not halfway, really.  Water is pretty heavy - you don't need a lot of it to weigh something down (and we've had a couple of high-wind storms since I put it up, and they didn't affect it at all.)  I also figured the black color would make it really swell up in hot sunlight so I left it kind of flaccid.  It works great that way, even though we are always kicking it back and forth across our splintery deck to get it out of the way, and it tolerates this abuse just fine.  (We kick it in toward the dinette when we want to make the diameter smaller, to get around it to get to the grill and/or yard, and then when we're eating inside the screen, we kick the bottom outward to maximize the space inside.  Oh, yes, the space inside is MORE than adequate when the bottom is extended out all the way!)It probably WOULD be easier to install on your patio umbrella with two people, but I have to to everything myself around here, so I've become pretty resourceful about that.  Here's how I did it all by myself:  Just lay the open umbrella down gently on its side, on two of its ribs while it's open (I didn't even bother to remove it from the center of the table to do this - just tilted the whole assemblage) Then drape the screen over it with the adjustable hole in the middle.  To adjust the height/fit so that the water-filled bladder will reach to the ground when you stand it up, just pull it across so that it's long enough to touch the table legs/bottom of the umbrella stand/whatever.  Tie off the adjustable drawstring, then stand the umbrella back up.  Voila!  You have just earned two more points on your ResourcefulWoman Badge, and you don' need nobody's help with nuffin!"

729,129,4,"This is an attractive high-capacity bird feeder in the style of ""The Tank"" as commonly known at the Audubon Society shop.  It functions by closing access to the feeder when the squirrel puts its weight on the bar.  Birds which are much lighter in weight than squirrels will not lower the bar and can feed happily and freely.Overall a much more affordable alternative to The Tank, the capacity of this bird feeder is 12-lbs and depending on how hungry/greedy the birds are in your area, the seed can last up to a week or more before needing to be refilled.  This is perfect for skittish birds that tend to avoid areas with a lot of human contact.This feeder is also available in red and a green whereas the Tank was only available in green.The only caution/con is that a strong sturdy branch is needed to hang this from.  Also this bird feeder needs to hung high enough so that squirrels will not be able to stand up and feed from the feeder by bypassing the weight trigger that closes access to the feeder.Overall highly recommended."
1329,120,4,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal, but it's stronger than you might expect, and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp', tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid, and while much thinner, the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft, it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if used properly and not abused, it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
714,592,5,"My outdoor ants positively love this TERRO ANT BAIT PLUS T2600!  An hour or two after I spread it along my condo's foundation, there were ants happily swarming all around the bait.  This was no surprise:  I ordered this stuff because theTerro PreFilled Liquid Ant Killer II Baitsworked wonderfully well at eliminating the tiny indoor ants that seemed totally indifferent to the Grant's Ant Stakes that I've used for many years to control indoor and outdoor ants.  (My condo seems to have been built on a giant ant hill.)This ant bait is ""Plus"" because it supposedly controls snails, slugs, cockroaches, and other pests.  It seems to be a moderately heavy-duty pesticide, because the label instructions say to wear protective clothing (waterproof gloves, long sleeves, long trousers, shoes and socks), and to change and wash the clothing after applying the bait.  The bait is harmful to humans if absorbed through the skin.The bait itself is very easy to apply, and there's no need to touch it.  The granules are small, but heavy enough not to be picked up by the slightest of breezes (as happens with ant/slug/snail bait in ""meal"" form).  Because they're small, the granules are easily broadcast with the shaker top.  The label instructions say that the bait can be used both outdoors and indoors, but indoor use will obviously require extra care to keep the bait in cracks and crevices and other places where people and animals won't be coming into contact with it.  For indoor use, I'm going to stick with the pre-filled liquid bait traps, but I'm delighted with the way that this Terro Ant Bait Plus attracts and controls outdoor ants."
530,698,5,I have always wanted a hummingbird feeder and this antique one is full of charm!  It is even more beautiful than I expected.  I love the glass (not plastic) bottle which is embossed and the cute red flowers against the copper color feeding area are so pretty!  I know the red color attracts the hummingbirds but I wanted something more subtle and have already received compliments on it!
1536,167,5,"We have wood siding on our house and the woodpeckers love it.  A friend of mine suggested trying deer repellent as it had worked for them.  I sprayed the areas the woodpeckers seemed to favor and haven't seen them on the house since.  I'm not entirely sure this stuff did the job all by itself and it wasn't also simply a change in the season, but they're gone and I will use this again in the spring."
1016,622,5,"This is a wonderful new product that those of us in the Pacific Northwest can use to kill slugs and snails.  This year has been very wet and the little creatures multiply like mad eating their way through my hostas and other plants.  Dr. T.'s Slug Killer is the perfect answer because it is not harmful to birds, wildlife, or your pets.  It works best if you start very early and kill them before they have a chance to lay more eggs.  However, it also works just fine if you start today!"
612,867,3,so far this seems ok... only have a limited about of time to review this (vine product) but seems ok. See a few bugs here and there but may not be the product but the application of product. I used it in a hurry but seems as good as any other brand. easy to use handle etc which was nice.
113,167,4,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants, specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But, then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also, this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly, you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again."
697,468,3,"These rat snap traps are designed to be easily set with bait and to reliably snap and kill the rat when the rat goes after the bait. While these are pretty good at functioning as designed (in my experience) this is a messy way to kill a rat. The snapping teeth will often cut and maim a rat without instantly killing it, and this is cruel to the rat and unpleasant for the person wishing to exterminate the rat. When this caught and killed a rat I just threw it away rather than trying to extricate the rat and clean the trap for reuse. For reusable traps I recommend the electronic ones, that will electrocute the rat when it goes in after the bait. Those electronic traps work well indoors but can't be used outdoors. With any trap it is important to bait it and place it properly, and to check it regularly. The Tomcat snap trap is fairly good at killing rats but not a clean, humane method. It is OK for some people but it's not my preference. I've tried multiple types of rat traps and none are perfect, so I would say it's important to consider the pros and cons of each design relative to what your specific needs are."
10,646,5,"I don't use much DE, so I'm guessing this'll last me several years in the garden, and on my dog.I bought the larger amount because it was the bets price I could find ANYWHERE. These diatom shells are millions of years old, so i figure they'll easily last another 5 years sitting in my garage. Never have to buy DE again, and I got it cheap as can be."
681,13,4,The local bird population was eating all the raspberries a day or two before they were ripe enough for us. This thwarted them!It is a bit tricky to put on by oneself. I recommend at least two people if you have much of a span to cover.  We will be buying more.
1308,403,5,"This is an unexpectedly nice fire ring! I am using it tonight around my front yard firepit (a scooped out dish in the ground, lined with limestone rocks).The design is not too 'cowboy kitch': the horses are stylized, and can mix it up with more than the bear-and-moose decor you often see around cabins.I like it for lighting a fire in my pit to watch as the sun sets over the red rocks. This is really pretty when flames are burning.It functions more for looks than as a windbreak, although it does help some with wind.SORT OF PORTABLEIt manages to be lightweight for a hunk of metal. It's easy to carry around, once assembled, and sturdy enough. It contains a fire nicely around a small to medium firepit. A large firepit, as in one containing wooden pallets, would be too big.Note that this fire ring is only somewhat portable. It does break down into four pieces that nest together, but you need to realize the pieces/bolts will be covered with soot (and possibly hot) and you need to use a tool to tighten and release the dirty (hot) screwbolts.With that in mind, you can still pick up the entire ring and toss it in the back of your pickup, which makes it 'portable'. It's not heavy or awkward to carry for a 5'4 woman like me.I can see cleaning it off and breaking it down at each season's end to store nicely in my RV for travel.There is no sack for the included bolts and tools (just a tiny ziplock), or for the four metal pieces that make the ring, so I will have to figure out some way to keep all the pieces together when disassembled in the RV basement. A canvas carry bag would have been a nice touch.NOT A FIREPITFor people who intend to set up the ring once and leave it alone, assemblage is a non-issue. Realize this is NOT a firepit. There is no top or bottom to the ring. If you set the metal on flammable materials, the fire will not be contained. Use your own best judgement with fire! :)"
1208,72,5,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard, but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to, but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner, you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall, we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1333,290,4,"Earthbox is design and technology, and they've worked the bugs out.  If you have the desire to grow things, and maybe in an area with limited space, Earthbox will make it happen for you.  Here's some of the pros and cons of the system as I've found it in use:1)  It's relatively expensive.  If what you really want is organic vegetables, don't use an Earthbox.  Go to your local organic grocery and buy organic vegetables.  If what you want is the pleasure of gardening and eating something you grew yourself, and cost is only secondary, Earthbox gets this done with a minimum of hassle.  If you want to grow plants and cost is a primary issue, this isn't the right way either.  Do it in dirt, or hit the Internet and find the free plans for the so-called EarthTainer.2)  Earthbox is a design system for a semi-hydroponic way of growing plants.  Water sits in the bottom of the plastic container in reservoirs, is 'wicked up' by the growing medium, grabs on to dolomite lime and fertilizer (placed in during the assembly of the box) on the way up, and then hits the plant roots, which absorb it.  This leads to a few simple principles:2a)  Your growing medium must love water (i.e., be hygroscopic).  The right thing to use is Canadian sphagnum peat moss.  This is expensive and gets more so if you have the Earthbox company ship it to you; try your local garden supply store.  Coconut coir is another option that replaces, and is significantly cheaper than, sphagnum peat; I haven't tried it.2b)  Your growing medium must allow enough air to get at the roots.  Roots have to breathe.  Therefore, I roll my own growing medium of 2 parts sphagnum to 1 part perlite.  I do not use vermiculite because I have no wish to breathe asbestos, which you pretty much have to do if you empty out a bag of vermiculite.2c)  Plants need nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to grow properly, as well as miniscule amounts of trace minerals.  They also like a certain pH, and to get that you need dolomite lime.  Any non-soluble fertilizer will do; try not to pay a lot of money for it.  Also, soluble fertilizers, while not recommended, will work, because, remember, this semi-hydroponic system is all about moving water to the roots.  Use of soluble fertilizers removes the idiot proofing, because soluble fertilizers can burn roots or leaves if you get the concentrations wrong.3)  The replaceable covers are actually a pretty important part of the system.  They reflect light, keep an even soil temperature both daytime and night, keep bugs out of the growing medium, stop water from transpiring off the surface of the medium, and are treated with fabric softener sheets against static cling.  All those things are important.  They smell like Bounce.  If you live in a warm area, white side up; in a cooler place, black side up.4)  The casters are a nice touch because the box is a two-person job to move once it's full and wet.  You don't have to buy them from Earthbox; you can get a set of casters cheap at any hardware store.5)  If the kind of plant you're growing isn't listed, compare the average size of your mature plant to the recommended list of plants.  Large leafy plants are best approximated by tomatoes; Earthbox recommends two to a plant.6)  Although backyard and patio are the recommended uses, I've also found these boxes great for greenhouses and growlight conditions.  Yields are pretty high.7)  The fill pipe fits a 5/8"" hose perfectly, which is a nice touch.  You can make a simple system out of a wine cork and painted baling wire to tell you how full your Earthbox is today.  This involves taking a straight 18"" of baling wire, impaling a wine cork with it, and putting the cork down the pipe until it floats.  Labeling the wire with paint or tape is left as an exercise for the reader!In short, if you want to do semi-hydroponic container gardening and have success right out of the box, get an Earthbox."
213,832,3,"The deer population has decimated my plants for years. I really would not mind if the product smelled bad,as others I have tried.This one actually is less offensive to the smell,and seems to detour most attacks. This was a bad winter and some bushes got it anyway. I hope that it continues to discourage the attacks. More later at the end of this spring season. have lost so many great shrubs and plants last year."
1569,741,5,"This sofa in comfy, and durable. Stands up to the elements great and it has given me soo much relaxing pleasure out in the great outdoors under the sun, smoking my cigars."
1235,870,4,I did not notice a major difference while using this product. I needed to use the same amount of sanitizer as before. The only notable difference I observed was that there was not as much scum buildup over time so I did not have wipe clean the inside edges of the hot tub.
1375,707,5,"The Good:  This is a great power washer.  I bought it to replace a 2000psi electric power washer that could just never cut it around the property.  This washer does everything you could ever want to do on an average residential property.  I have used it to clean mold off of the side of the house (vinal siding), clean the driveway and sidewalk, and stone walls.  I also bought the Generac Sidewalk cleaner attachment and the two combined are better than anything.  The hose is long enough for my purposes, the attachment heads are conveniently stored on the handle and the actual washer wand stores nicely in the handle as well.  The engine is easy to start up and the gas tank hold quite a lot of gas.The Bad:  I wish the hose was a little more flexible.  It is a relatively inflexible plastic.  If it could act more like a garden hose, it would prevent kinking and bending."
1055,927,4,"Packaging was good and kept the fire pit safe and without damage during transit. Assembly was straightforward and quick. It only took about 10 minutes to open the box and have it fully assembled. The firepit is of average build quality. The basin is coated in a matte black fire paint that seems to be of only marginal quality. As you touch the basin, dust or residue comes off on your hand. This could also be indicative of just a lack of cleanup as the unit was manufactured. Visually, the unit is modern looking with simple, clean lines. The contrast between the matte black basin and the almost chrome finish of the legs is very nice. The basin is not real deep. I would estimate it could handle approximately three medium sized logs at most. Overall, this is a very functional and nice looking firepit. With the included screen top and poker tool you will have everything you need for a nice fire."
1207,639,5,"They work well, are a thick plastic - I only wish they had a smaller size too!! I will buy again as needed."
938,190,5,"I've been frustrated with the hose nozzles I've bought because they all seem to leak.  This Dramm does NOT leak, so that makes it a five-star item in my book.  Now we'll see if it has the endurance to last an entire summer."
324,658,4,"This charcoal works great. I do not use starter fluid I use a chimney starter and It took longer but it worked well. It burns very consistently and for a longer time than the Kingsford that I normally use. Eco friendly? Charcoal grilling in general is not eco friendly. The use of coconut shells instead of trees is novel way to be eco friendly but inaccurate. Kingsford is not clear cutting the amazon or ravaging old growth forests to make briquettes. They use wood scraps and always have. So it's not like your saving an important tree grove by burning coconuts. So why would I buy these for twice the price of Kingsford? They burn longer and have a more neutral flavor. So this is perfect for seafood that does not benefit in my opinion from strong smokey flavors. And because they do not have the sure fire grooves that Kingsford has, they last longer. For slow roasting meats like pork shoulder for pulled pork where you will need 2-6 hours for slow cooking they work together as a team very well. Start with the Kingsford ""Ready in 15 min"" and add 4-6 briquettes of Coshell every 40 minutes or so. I was able to keep a constant temp of about 220. I will keep a bag of these for that purpose alone.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes"
880,272,1,"In my experience, it always takes a few days before for the birds start eating from the newly hung feeder, and this feeder was no exception.  It is the second feeder in my front  yard, the first being a Brome.  And so far, the birds still prefer the Brome to the No/No feeder.  The No/No feeder has very little rain protection for the seeds, as the mesh part, where the seeds are, is completely open.Also, if purchasing this feeder, it does not include a hook to hang it in a tree, just the handle on top of the feeder.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- changing rating from 4 stars to 1.  The seeds stay piled up in the middle of the feeder and do not slide down to the tray or sides without help.  So I finally removed it from the tree as I find it to much work to keep shaking the seeds down.  And I really dislike the fact of taunting birds with seeds just out of reach."
719,336,5,Ordered in March going to Fl. And they arrived quickly and all alive. The worms are happy and thriving in my compost bed. They are already improving the crappy dense non draining pile of fill that I have been putting my household compost in. I noticed the hump in the middle is going down faster and it's getting more like soil rather then muck fill. Still has a long way to go before I can plant but the worms are definitely improving the quality and airation. Gotta have worms and this company was a good choice to get them from!
1256,869,4,"This product is made of heavy black plastic and does not look conspicuous on your lawn. It is also only a couple of feet in diameter and about 3' high. You put water in the base and forget about it until something goes in its path, then it suddenly squirts water where it picked up motion. It is so funny to see animals react. It will get you too! If you forget to aim it in another direction. The main drawback is that the moles eat my bulbs from under the earth where the repellent cannot ""see"" them."

1311,351,5,"The huge blackbirds cannot steal from this one.  I feed big birds and even squirrels, but needed a feeder that the finches and smaller birds could utilize.  This is it, and I love it.  It is also very attractive."
398,420,5,"Don't get me wrong, I love squirrels.  I set out peanuts every day for them and the Blue Jays.  Our squirrels just don't eat the bird seed; they disconnect the bird feeder and steal the entire feeder.  Sometimes we find it and sometimes we have to buy a new feeder.This squirrel baffle worked perfectly.  Our shepherd's hooks are tall so we were able to set the baffle about 4 feet off the ground and away from trees or other objects so they can't jump above it.  Mount the ball onto your shepherd's hook pole and then snap the baffle above the ball and lower it into place.  If the squirrels climb up to the baffle they cannot get above it as it tilts on the ball and they lose their balance and fall off the pole.They are persistent and sometimes they sit there and stare at the thing for an hour.  I can see the little mental wheels turning but so far they haven't figured out a way to get around it.  I think when they are sitting there with their little paws to their face that they are praying for a strong wind to blow down the shepherd's hook.  That has worked a couple of times!"
458,290,5,"I have five EB now. I really like them for veggies, esp tomatoes. One box holds one big tomatoe, not two. The EB website forum gets a bit nasty about following the directions perfectly, but I have found them to be guidelines.Hint one, the box can use potting soil,not just soilless mixtures.Two, the fertilizer included may not be enough, extra food can be added after a month or so, tomatoes are big eaters.Three, the plastic cover is not necessary, it just molds here in the NW.Occasional top water & food will not ruin the system.The water tank holds two gallons, and for precise indoor gardening, you will need to make a dip stick.( this number is no where on the website, I hand measured, because I do feed some plants liquied food in the resovir)My one wish is the boxes could be deeper for deep rooted plants.One box has a loose wheel I should have complained about right away. On the subject of wheels, play with all the wheels and make sure the box rolls right before adding weight, I move mine a lot and wish I had fussed with rolling first. Shipping was amazon super speed, and the amazon price hovers around 55 -65$, with shipping and wheels, which is cheaper than the EB website.Happy gardening."
752,698,5,"We have had hummingbird feeders for years.  But they have always been the red and white plastic ones.  It never occurred to me to look for a beautiful feeder until I saw this.  I love all things vintage or antique so this was perfect for me.When I received it, I was a little frustrated because it was so well wrapped and tapped that I was afraid I was going to break it trying to get it open.  Luckily the feeder is very sturdy and I got it unwrapped without incident.  It was easy to open and hang.  My only worry was that the bottom seemed a little bit flimsier than the rest but it works fine.  It looks beautiful hanging out by my flowers.  This was a great idea well executed.  I think I will need to get one for my Mother-in-Law as well."
125,251,5,"I was looking for something safe and easy to use to kill fleas. My cats got some and they are indoor only so the fleas must have been on something I brought in the house. I didn't want to fog the whole house so I washed the cats in flea shampoo, washed the throw rugs and bedding in hot water to kill them, then sprinkled this around the edges of the mattress in the room they sleep in & I sprinkled some very lightly on top of the mattress. I made the bed with a thin mattress pad as well as clean sheets and the next day there were 3 dead fleas in the mattress pads so it worked and for now my cats are not scratching. I'll do it again every 2 weeks for the next 6 weeks to be sure the fleas didn't leave eggs that will hatch later. Sure was a quick way to take care of it all, of course, I have all natural hardwood floors in my house throughout so no carpet for the fleas to have gotten into & I don't know if this item is safe to sprinkle on carpets because if your pets lick it maybe it would make them ill but I don't know so I wouldn't try that."
1202,953,5,"To clear up possible confusion, the 40-volt MAX without battery and battery pack is the least expensive of the three product options.This trimmer is far superior to others that I've used.  First, it has a long arm that's balanced; it's easy to hold.  The material is even flexible so that it's unlikely to break.  Next, the trigger is earlier to hold than triggers on others I've tried.  Finally, the battery (I have the 4.0 Ah) lasts long enough for me to cut my very small yard and still not have to recharge for the next use.The battery is definitely heavier than those of my old trimmer.  It's worth it to me though because the machine I had been using for two years wasn't worth a darn.  Another difference is that the power output for this Oregon unit is constant.  There seems to be no fade which is what I had experienced from the beginning with my old trimmer."
98,322,5,"We were having trouble with white flies and other insects that were killing our tomatoes and other potted plants, This little trap catches them easily and since we do not like insecticides, it is part of our overall organic war on harmful bugs. We use this in combination with Lady Bugs and soap spray to keep the flies and small insect in check.  The advantage in their small size is that they can be placed in different locations on the plant to more effectively catch insects.  To date no Lady bugs have been catch by the traps."
90,936,5,"This is a nice potting mix for starting seedlings.  I shape newspaper into small cups and add this potting mix to my cups to grow seedlings.  Once it's warm enough, I transplant my newspaper cups outside so no transplant shock at all.  This mix seems to work well with my method."
232,790,4,"I love watching the birds (and OK, the squirrels!) in the yard.  This feeder was a very nice addition to the front yard.  It has four feeding docks so several birds can enjoy it at once, and it looks quite nice hanging from a tree.  I like the copper look, though it's a coating and I wonder how long it will last if I leave it out for the birds over the winter.My main issue is the plastic cover for each side.  The instructions say to take it down and clean it often to prevent mold and such in the seed, and I think the panels are meant to slide out for easy cleaning.  For my feeder, this also means quite a bit of hassle and frustration filling it if it's near empty.  The panels slide all over, seed spills out the bottom, and it just doesn't seem very sturdy.  If I'm on the ball and fill it half-way through, the panels are stuck down by the weight of the seed and it works well.  Not sure if this is an issue with just my feeder, i.e. a defective one, of it others have had this problem.Also, this is not a squirrel-proof feeder. I rather like seeing the squirrels, especially when they have to use their ingenuity to break into a feeder, and they had this one down in under two hours.  The knob at the top does not lock firmly, so if they hang from the tree and lift up the lid, enough twisting and prying lifts it enough to grab a paw full of seed.Overall, it's a very nice looking feeder and the birds love it. If not for the weird plastic panels, I'd give it five stars."
1212,167,4,"I remember an old joke about someone who ""kept a diary"" about their move to Minnesota (though you could insert any northern state here, sorry Minnesota!).  When they first saw the beautiful landscape and snow during their first winter, they wondered how anyone can tire of such scenic wonder.  By the end of the winter, enduring freezing temperatures, endless snow shoveling, and hitting a deer with their car, the person was wondering who in their right mind would want to live in such a place.When I transitioned into adulthood and bought my own place, I went through such a phase.  However, my nemesis is the rabbit!  I moved to the suburban Midwest to an area where coyotes and hawks were not found amongst our manicured lawns and cedar fenced properties.  The result is a rabbit population like I have never seen in my years of growing up in rural America where predators roam and hunting is a way of life.While trying to make my property beautiful, being the scientific mind I am, I began to develop a theory that there is a direct relationship to how much a single landscaping plant cost and how tasty the local rabbit population finds it.  My ""non-indigenous"" $20 Home Depot potted flowers were a hit with the rabbit population while the local plant species that grow wild (aka weeds) were free to grow as high as the Willis Tower.I hate killing things for the sake of killing something and I really hate killing something that is just looking for a meal, so I began investigating non-lethal alternatives that did not involve live trapping and putting the pest in some poor farmer's field.  After failed attempts with moth balls, different repellent sprays, Milorganite, and other similar products and wives tales, my flower garden was still a high priced salad bar for the long eared minions.I had the opportunity to try Deer Off spray, which claims to ward off deer, rabbits, and squirrels.I first tried the product on some plants around my mailbox and waited a week.  The plants failed to survive, but not because of a poor product or determined bunnies.  An out of control car plowed through my planter and mailbox.  Hmmm...Deer Off does not deter out of control minivans.  Check!I moved to some other plants and I have to say I was quite pleased with the results.  My problem is with rabbits only, so I cannot speak as to the effectiveness of the product on deer and squirrels.Testing the product over the summer, I found out the following:1.  I tried applying directly to the plant as directed as well as tried applying to the soil around the plant but not on the plant itself.  Using the product on the plant itself had far better results.  If you are averse to applying this directly to your plants, applying it to the soil did help a little, but the results of doing so lasted a week at most before the rabbits began munching my tender pea plants.2.  The product does not last 3 months on fast growing plants.  After trying various times between applications on different plants, I would personally recommend applying to fast growing flower and vegetable plants every two weeks.I did not find the smell of the product that terrible at all.  Despite the active ingredient being putrescent egg solids, the smell of the solution reminded me of wet paint.  After the product dried, I did not notice the smell at all.I thought the battery powered sprayer was quite awesome.  While it is not difficult to use a classic trigger sprayer you have to constantly pump, the ""full auto"" batter powered sprayer made application very easy and quick.There were a few things I did not like about the product, but none of them were what I would deem deal breakers.  While the product did not require much ""assembly"", you did have to break the seal on the bottle and drop a flexible tube into the bottle.  I found this part a bit messy.  Second, a set of 4 AA batteries in the sprayer did not last me the entire summer.Overall, I was happy with this product for deterring rabbits.  An application of the repellent was good for about two weeks when I used it on faster growing annual plants.  I did not see the effectiveness of the product wane at all with time as long as I kept reapplying it.  If you have a rabbit issue, I would definitely say this product is worth a try."
263,81,5,"I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens, then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile."

1120,354,5,"If I had known how much I'd like this hose, I'd have hooked it up a lot sooner. The tri-grip collar made for one of the easiest and most secure connections I've ever had with a hose. The large collar is easy to grip and allows for plenty of manual torque. The other end with a metal coupling also allowed easy nozzle attachment.So far I've experienced no kinks and winding up the hose has also been a good experience. The next time I have to buy a hose, the Gilmour Platinum will be my first choice.Gilmour backs this hose with a full lifetime replacement policy and no fine print."
1001,878,4,"Over the last five years, we've used three different brands of electronic rat traps.  They've all worked...you bait them, set them out without turning them on (to let the rats get used to their presence) and then turn them on.  From then on, you check them every morning and see what you've caught.  It's kind of like fishing, except the fish have four legs, a tail and aren't exactly edible.The battery life has been good.  The D-cells store a lot more charge compared to the C-cells used in some competing versions.  I haven't caught thirty rats yet, so I don't know if it meets the spec and I'm not about to act (as has been suggested) like a surrogate rat and stick my hand in there.Rat disposal is trivial...you pick the entire thing up, hold it over a trash can and the dead rat will slide out.All in all, I strongly recommend the Rat Zapper.  It's not as much fun as a 12-gauge, but it's a lot less messy."

Higher settings will drain the battery faster.>Charge indicator directly on the battery (four green bars).>Battery charger also has a charge status indicator.>All B&D; 36V garden tools use the same lithium ion battery so it's convenient to have several 36V batteries charged up and ready.>Convenient and eco-friendly and much quieter sweeper vs. gas powered leaf blowers.Slight Dislike:>The plastic blower tubes were a bit too snug to snap in place cleanly.  I simply used some talcum powder on the attachment points so tubes snapped in with ease.Overall:Extremely useful gardening tool for sweeping debris; much faster than using a broom.  The whole idea is to sweep and gather leaves + debris in one place to be removed with broom and dustpan then disposed in the trash or let the weekly street sweeper vacuum it up.  Don't be like some inconsiderate neighbors who blow leaves and debris onto adjacent neighbors' properties to let others clean up their mess."

1457,35,5,"Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole."

338,864,3,"Although I own over 10 grills, this is my first infrared grill.  For my current tests, I grilled hamburgers, brats, steak, jalapeno poppers (wrapped in bacon), and finally some chicken thighs.  Although flare ups were reduced due to the design of the grates, flare ups certainly are not eliminated with meats that have high fat (i.e., brats, bacon, and 80/20 hamburger).  Part of the flare ups that I experience, though, might have been due to me having the heat set too high as I was still learning the traits of this grill.For this review, I will be comparing the Char-Broil infrared to Weber's Q120 gas grills.  Let's dive right in to my PROs/CONs...PROS====+ 98% pre-assembled (no tools required for remaining parts)+ External temperature gauge+ No battery needed for ignition button (but I have had these types of buttons degrade over time)+ Convenient side handles+ Quality, solid constructionCONS====- Front handle not deep enough (fingers can touch hot metal if fully gripping handle)- No side trays (Weber's side trays nicely folds into the grill when not in use)- Using too much gas OR leaking gas?- Requires cleaning after each use and is harder to clean than competition- No stand or cart option to available to buy- No place to hang grilling tools- During daytime, difficult to see through infrared grate in order to check flame is still lit- Harder to grill precisely or with sensitive items (e.g., fish) due to hotter temps, even on low setting- Struggles to work with LP tanks bigger than 1 pound (although not officially supported in manual)After opening the box, I was happy to see the grill mostly pre-assembled.  The only real gripe during assembly is that the manual does not show how to install the vaporizer bar which other reviewers have also complained about.  I'll also add that the manual doesn't talk much about the grease pan, and I found it a tad tricky to remove.  Thankfully I am used to grills so I had a good idea how to install and use these two items.The company claims that food grilled on an infrared will be juicier -- and this is probably the number one selling point I'm interested in.  A good test for this claim would be to grill two pieces of meat from the same package -- one on the infrared and the other no a non-infrared.  Using an insta-read meat thermometer, I now have tried this test multiple times -- to my surprise the infrared version either comes out dryer or is about the same as the gas version.  I'd be interested if others have different results.  The company also claims the grill has even heat, but this is not a huge selling point for me as most modern, small grills at this price range do a good enough job.The number one knock on this grill is that it is high maintenance.  Due to the design of these grill grates, stuck-on-food (which often becomes charcoal-like substance) is unable to fall through.  This means that you'll have to use their special cleaning tool after each grill and then remove the grill grate to empty the debris.  With traditional grates, you can pre-heat your grill and nearly incinerate the gunk followed by some nice wire brushing.  Those ashes and 'coal' flakes fall down into the grill out of the way so that you only have to do a deep cleaning 1-2 times per year.  The manual does recommends running your grill 10-15 minutes after you cook to burn the gunk, but due to how fast infra-reds heat up, the clean burn time is usually shorter thankfully.  You then wait for grill to cool down a little, scrub it with their tool (and optionally a wire brush), empty the grate, and then apply cooking oil to help protect the metal.Opposite of the product's claims, I suspect that the grill uses more gas than its competition.  However this could have been due to a leaky valve or even a leaky gas can.  I am now unscrewing the gas cans in-between usages to test if my shutoff valve is indeed the culprit.  Unscrewing the can when not in use is per the advice of the manual, which I don't like to do but most grill companies advise this.  I'll likely do the soap/water leak test in the coming days.  Another gripe is that often there is a strange whistling sound made when the gas flows.  The product manual says this noise does not affect safety, but it doesn't give a vote of confidence either.  I've also had my fire go out 2-3 times now during grilling, especially during windy days.  This may be due to the exposed holes in the pipe from the regulator to the grill -- a style of design a don't recall ever seeing elsewhere.  If you add all this up, you can see why I don't have much faith in this regulator.Three other deficiencies of this grill is that there are no side trays, no hooks/pegs to hang your BBQ tools, and there are no options to buy a stand/cart.  Without these options, you'll quickly get annoyed.  You'll discover that without a side tray that you won't have a conveniently close spot to place a plate, for example.  And where are you going to stand this grill?  You can put it on concrete but who wants to squat down that far.  So you'll likely have to build a stand for this maybe out of bricks or figure something else out.  By the way, do not put this grill on wood unless you get a heat resistant grill mat/pad.Don't get me wrong -- this grill has many things going for it.  But I've been spoiled by Weber's Q series and all the features the Weber has to offer.  Further, I am not yet convinced that infrared is living up to the hype.  We were told that since restaurants use infrared, we can now have food as 'good' as restaurants at home.  I'm not sure that is always a desirable goal.  With a few exceptions, my steaks and burgers often taste better than most restaurants.  I suspect infrared is used in restaurants primarily for speed and not for taste with maybe the exception of seared, crusted steaks (which I don't care for).  In other words, it seems as if infrared is trying to solve problems that I do not have with my traditional gas grill and may come at the cost of being less diverse as it is not good at handling more sensitive meats.[07/20/2013] Update: Char Broil has lowered the price of their grill from when I originally reviewed it making it now about $50 less than Weber's Q120 (although both list prices are about the same).  This price change now puts the Char Broil in the league of the Q100 which does not have fold-out trays."
1578,821,5,"I got this mouse trap for our hunting cabin, which has some mice on occasion.  The neat things about this trap are that the mechanism to set off the trap is internal and adjusts itself, without you having to twiddle with the triggers.  Also the mechanisms are internal, and therefore out dogs will not accidently set it off.  The location of the bait (they suggest peanut butter) is on the bottom inside the trap where the mice can smell it but can't really get to it.  Since each ""trap"" is really 3 different traps, capable of catching 3 mice at a setting, this thing is great and will catch a mouse along a wall no matter what direction he comes from.  I will set the trap out at the cabin this weekend and I feel sure if there is a mouse still in the cabin that this Tri Kill will get the little monsters."

822,244,4,What can you really say. My last one of these lasted three years which is about normal thus happy with thepurchase and it was less than at the local retailer
1089,268,5,"Wow what a great grill cover. This thing is HUGE and heavy duty. There is no way this is ever going to blow off my grill. The fabric this is made out of stays flexible all the time even in the deep cold - it doesn't feel cheap and nasty like Weber's covers.I have an ancient Weber gas grill and have always used Weber's custom made grill covers. They have held up over time, lasting around ten years each. That doesn't mean they look great or feel great, they just do their job covering my grill. Over time the vinyl has gotten hard. This grill cover is way cheaper than the Weber custom job, is made of heavier fabric, covers my grill better, and is more flexible.There are two side vents to let water escape from inside the grill. And there is a large zippered pouch on the front of the cover. The bottom is almost overkill it is so well built. There is an elastic cord to cinch the bottom tight around the grill. There are also two snap tie downs to attach the cover even better to the grill.What a great grill cover for an incredibly reasonable price."
1276,601,3,"I was disappointed in it&#8230; and that&#8217;s a first for me on a Fiskars tool. The handle is metal but the foot plate that gets all the pressure and leverage from tilting the tool back is plastic. However, my disappointment is in the fact that I can&#8217;t get it too be of much use on anything other than dandelions/. We have some pretty tough weeds here in the summer months on the high desert and this tool is pretty much useless on them all. Our noxious weeds have some really strong roots and I almost feel like they&#8217;re pulling back whenever I try to pull them by hand. The root bulbs aren&#8217;t large so there&#8217;s nothing for the spikes on this tool to hook into so it doesn&#8217;t work. Dandelions have a large root pod just under the surface of the soil so this will grab onto it and make quick work of pulling them out and leaving a nice little hole afterwards. Since I really didn&#8217;t think this was so limited in what it would pull, and the foot plate is plastic, I have to go with 3-stars&#8230; but if all I had were dandelions I&#8217;d be giving it 5-stars and hoping that the plastic never breaks or bends and renders the tool useless."
1520,178,5,"I have been using this for over a year and it has cut through all my branches and small shrubs without any issues. It makes very quick work of anything.  Anyone can use it, my wife cut many branches and I pulled on them.  Not always a clean cut when stressing the branch by pulling down, but 95% of the time I have clean cuts.One issue is just the cord like all plug-in electric tools, just put it over your shoulder to keep it away from being cut.Don't forget chain oil, don't let it get dried out.I let my father borrow mine and was lucky to get it back so I had to buy him one.  He took an all day job removing dead lilac bushes and turned it into an hour job cutting it down with this."
42,490,5,"wow! At first I put this sideways so the indicator was up. I didn't read the instructions. The mice got in and took the bait and left, without triggering the trap. I was about to throw them out and try something else when, behold, I looked at the package and saw it was meant to stand upright. I re-set a new trap in that orientation and within 2 hours had caught my first mouse. Since this is a 2 pack, I fired up another one and got another mouse overnight. Now I wonder how many there are. I'm going to order 2 more and see. Good thing these come in a 2 pack. These mice had grown smart enough to avoid the old-fashioned wooden spring trap. But not this."
788,912,5,"This is our first propane grill. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the way charcoal flavors food, but now that we have a toddler who loves being outside, so we have happily traded the taste of charcoal for the convenience of propane.The Grill came in a surprising number of pieces. There was a lot more assembly required then I would have thought. It took my husband a little over an hours to unpack, assemble and dispose of the packaging. So, it was pretty quick. He said the installation was easy and intuitive with good instructions. Now, my husband tends to by very good at putting things together. The installation may take a little longer for most folks.The grill itself was easy to use and did a wonderful job of cooking, although cooking with propane is a little different than cooking with charcoal. (I&#8217;m sure many of you are rolling your eyes and thinking &#8220;DUH&#8221; right now&#8230;.)I have two criticisms about this grill. The first is that the side tables snap up and down, and they are very difficult and latch. This may get easier as they become more worn, but ultimately they feel kind of cheap on what is an otherwise well-made and gorgeous grill. The other criticism is very slight, but the drip pan is a disposable aluminum tray. I wish they would have made a little more effort here and given something a little more sturdy.Overall, we are thus far thrilled with this grill. Everything we have cooked so far has been great and I&#8217;m finding that I don&#8217;t miss the charcoal flavor as much as I thought I would. My husband is finding that he doesn&#8217;t miss the mess associated with charcoal at all!"

1246,126,2,"I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied, however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk. If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly, they leak, and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded. The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on."
0,809,3,"After I received this I noticed that the manufacturer has discontinued producing it and it makes me wonder why. I am far from being an expert on these matters but in my personal experience a product is usually discontinued because it doesn't sell or it is flawed. So, I really did not expect much when I spread this on my yard to combat the one gopher and the more than one mole.I got exactly what I expected - not much. In fact, I got nothing except possibly ridicule from my unwelcome yard guests. I can see why it was discontinued. I gave it three stars because other reviews said it worked for them. I am trying to be fair because although it did not work for me does not necessarily mean it does not work for everyone, as the reviews indicated."
1624,123,3,"The squirrels quickly learned how to open the lid. One morning, I awoke to see a large grey squirrel scrunched up INSIDE the hopper, chomping away at the seed! I chased him away, took the feeder down, and made an insert of heavy 1/2"" hardware cloth. I opened the top and crammed the hardware cloth over the seed (I made it to come way up to the top but didn't fill the seed to the top, hoping to discourage the squirrels) and re-hung the feeder. That worked for 2-3 days, until the squirrels learned that once they opened the lid, they could push in the sides of my ""wire cage"" to get to the seeds. So there he was again, inside the hopper, wedged between my wire insert and the window. The squirrels later learned how to remove the insert! My idea didn't work. Secondly, this feeder is usually sold complete with the pole sections, the grounder and hardware for mounting, for the same price as this one. This is the feeder only."
843,103,2,I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.
764,32,5,"I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well."
1017,951,5,"These grill tongs are great! I love how comfortable and sturdy the handle is, the oak is a very nice touch to it. The length of tongs is just right. The way these tongs look, you would think they would be very pricey, such a great deal for them here.  I truly do not think Mr. Grill can make a bad product. It is really is a brand name I know I can buy and know I'm getting a high quality product. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review."
726,688,5,"Light weight, lots of power, and got as much trimming done with one battery as I used to get with two ni-cad batteries. The recharge time is 8 hours per battery but I don't use it every day so have plenty of time to get the batteries charged between uses and lith-ion batteries hold their charge. Easy to assemble , just follow the direction provided."
345,117,4,great quality and balance. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
454,76,3,I wish it had more pockets but I got what I paid for. As I have used it I have found I could use more pockets but it is of good quality and is exactly as advertized.
1175,717,4,"This is a very well-designed, sturdy, functional, attractive, enjoyable product. I agree with other reviewers that the set up is simple. But it does take some time to set pieces together so things line up. We also needed a mallet to get the pieces all the way down. That is why I don't think this would be that easy to pack up for a camping trip. The pieces are now pretty tightly set together. For me that is ok. We do camp regularly, but I always intended this to be a backyard treat.And it is a treat. The hammock itself is thick, and also soft. Very attractive as well. It easily holds my weigh and I am a big guy. And with one person it is so wide that it is like floating on a cocoon. I am quite enjoying it. Recommended. But given how tight the pieces fit together on the one we have, I can't see many people taking it down, putting it up, taking it down. BUT for a super comfortable addition to your backyard, this is a great choice."
752,871,4,This is easy to use. I was worried about figuring out the right amount but it was very simple. This did a great job of eliminating a greasy ring that kept forming around the top of the hot tub. The water did look clearer but my main goal was addressing the oily ring.This did not cause any irritation on subsequent soaks in the hot tub.
53,703,3,"Many times when living in town I have needed to pot something up and rocks, gravel, broken pot shards were not around. This lightweight gadget replaces those and does a better job. I was about to give it 4 stars, but went and took a look at the price and was astounded at how much they were asking for this. I just don't see it. Yes, it is reusable and I hope to get many years of use out of it. The saving soil claim is a stretch. These are fairly thin, so you'll use about the same amount of potting soil. Nice, neat, easy to use, store and reuse, but for deep pockets only."
1378,577,1,"As someone else noted, the mechanism in these traps doesn't seem to work at all.  I loaded both traps 3 times and found that the mice got in, took the PB, and left little mouse pebbles inside, around, and... wait for it... even on top of the traps.  I guess this last act was the ultimate review of this device.In concept, these sounded great.  In reality, I'm going back to the old spring loaded traps.  Still waiting for the better mousetrap!"

I highly recommend it."
358,906,5,"The Scotts MaxFlex hose is wonderful.  I cannot review all the features the hose is advertised as having due to the cold weather here (and everywhere).  I can tell you what I have learned this far.We used it the day after receiving it, and it came just in time to prevent what could have been a catastrophe. Our winter has been horrid, not unlike most of the USA.  Our snowfall for the winter is double the normal amounts and it has piled high in our yard, driveway and walks coupled with sub-freezing temperatures.  I believe it was almost a full month in our area where the temperature never got above 20 degrees or maybe it did get into the low 20's.Suddenly we had a couple of days of warmer weather coupled with thunderstorms that caused flooding conditions in our yard.  With a driveway that slopes downward toward our house the melting snow and rain brought a cascade of water toward our garage door.  There is a grating with a drain at the lower end of the driveway that normally handles any torrential rainfall without problems.  This time it was overwhelmed.We have a submersible pump that we use for draining our hot tub when it is time to clean it and many hoses as well to use with it.  Unfortunately, the hoses were stored in an outdoor shed which could not be reached due to a 3-4 foot high snow accumulation covering the yard.  Plus, they are all 75 feet in length which causes a diminished flow rate when pumping.  Hot tub maintenance isn't urgent so they worked fine for that purpose.The new Scotts MaxFlex was 50 feet long and it hooked up perfectly to the submersible pump.  The hose instructions caution you to begin the hose initial setup in 70 degree + temperatures, and we could only partially do that.  The indoor temperature where the hose was stored was in that temperature range, but outside it was about 35 degrees at the time.  The female fitting coupling is brass not plastic and is larger than the normal coupling.  It measures 1 1/2"" in diameter, making it simple and easy to connect and disconnect. No tools needed to tighten or loosen and absolutely no leaks at the joint.  Once we made the hose connection and turned on the pump the shorter length let the water fly out of the hose and it kept up with the massive melting with ease.  We could pump the water out past the part of the driveway that slopes downward and out toward the storm sewers in the street.The hose did unroll easily, and did lay flat without kinks or curling, but the ""snap back"" feature wasn't even tried.  By the time the water flow had ceased, almost 2 1/2 hours, the hose was virtually frozen.  Soft and pliable at the start it was quite rigid when we pulled it into the garage.  We just dragged it in and put it anywhere we could so we were finally able to close the garage door and get out of the cold.  We did not attempt to recoil it because of the coldness that night, but it remained unkinked as it laid on the floor.  By the following morning it seemed it had attempted to recoil itself, but because it was all wrapped around chairs and benches in the garage that was not doable.  We were able to manually recoil it without difficulty later that afternoon once it had warmed.  There is a white or light yellow line about 1/8"" wide running the length of the hose that I suppose is to let you know if the hose is twisted.  We were only concerned with the urgency to remove the water as any flooding in the garage area would have continued into the recreation area of our home that is on the same level as the garage floor.  I did not look to see if there was any twisting in the hose that day, but in the summer that would be a benefit if twisting would prevent the anti-kinking feature.My opinion, given the task it was given to perform, even though it may cost more than cheaper hoses, is that this is an extraordinary value for a garden hose.  We always keep our hoses in a ""roll-up"" storage case and it always proves impossible to reroll the hose because it curls and kinks as it rewinds.  This hose will never suffer those troubles.It is the best!By the way, we can finally see bits of grass in our yard after weeks and weeks of constant snowfall.  Of course, the weekend forecast is for up to an additional 13"" of snow!  Hasn't this been a wonderful winter?  ( I know this has nothing to do with a product review, but the need to complain is overpowering!)"
484,98,4,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap, you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."

1259,103,5,"Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production, it's out of the way, well-engineered, they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years, so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great, you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea, highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!"
854,449,3,"The first thing you should know -- in case you missed it in the product description -- is that this will trap clothes moths (and that's a good thing because a moth stuck to this is not going to be laying any more eggs), but seeing moths in this really only shows that you have a problem and need to deal with the larvae which are the things putting holes in your wool clothes.I am happy to see no moths in my alerts so far.  It was easy to put the lure into the trap.  My only criticism is that this needs some type of loop so you can hang it on a clothes hanger.  Right now mine are on shelves in the closet but hanging close to wool clothes would be better."
857,354,5,"This is my 3rd purchase of all different sizes.  None of the hoses had any issues when used for the past 2 years.  The recent one I bought had a small leak when connecting the male end into a hand sprayer.  I used plumbers tape to create a tight seal within the threads and it fixed the problem.  I think it was the hand sprayer that actually had the problem and not the hose.  I had purchased a hose from Home Depot before I purchased these hoses and that hose looks like it got stung by mosquitos.  There's bumps all over the hose which indicates a weak inner casing.These platinum hoses have been sitting out in the Summer Heat and have also sat out all Winter long.  No cracks, bumps, or signs of wear and tear due to the elements.  Although the hose does kink it is easily fixed if you handle and store it correctly.  I don't think there's a hose out there that doesn't kink and has these great qualities and materials.  The large rubber grip and spring are a plus.  IMO it's easier to tighten and loosen than using the standard metal coupling on standard hoses.  I can see that all of my hoses will last for years to come."
878,838,4,"We've all seen those infomercials of this type of hose and, like me, most probably felt their claims were overblown. I've tried various of the ""flat"" garden hoses in the past and found them all wanting so I was a bit skeptical about this new type of ""expanding"" hose. However, after trying this one out I've become a believer and may never buy (or use) a bulky rubber or vinyl garden hose again. I'm also retiring our heavy, clunky garden hose winder as this hose is so simple to just coil up and store in the included bag or hang on the side of the house. I'd have given it 5 stars if it were a slightly less obnoxious color and if the fittings were brass rather than plastic. Still don't understand the ""magic"" that makes this relatively light and easy to handle hose expand like it does but it's fun to watch and it works almost instantly and just as easily contracts when you're done and ready to put away the hose."
1056,905,5,"Every fall, we share our property with about a million leaves. Our town doesn't have one of those leaf vacuums to pick up leaves at the curb but they do drive a truck around to pick up bags of autumn's largess. That means we have to pick them up and get them to the street. We usual use a shovel and our hands to pack the bags but when I saw this &#34;stomper&#34; I pounced. What a clever idea. It attaches easily to the end of our rake and does a good job compressing / packing the leaves so we actually use fewer bags. That's both an economical issue and a practical one. Obviously, the fewer bags you use, the less you have to spend buying them plus, the fewer bags you pile up at the curb, the less work you have to do hauling them to the street. Throw in that dozens of bags in front of the house is unsightly so the fewer bags out there the better.Overall, it does exactly what it says it will do and the humorous shape of the stomper (a foot) is just plain fun.We like it - recommended if you have to bag leaves."
501,217,3,"This is a nicely constructed product - looks like it will last for some time. As the other reviewers have said, it is a very handy tool to have for yard cleanup, and it collapses down quickly and easily for storage.It does NOT, however, come with a shoulder strap as noted in the photo and description. I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived in fine shape, was 100% new and unused, but no strap! I returned it, and re-ordered another. The replacement also lacked a strap. The product info sheet that comes with the item makes no mention of a strap, so I imagine Toro stopped including one to save costs.The lack of a strap is not a deal-breaker for my purposes, but it would be a handy addition. If you order one, keep in mind that you will not get the strap."
612,167,3,I can not say how this works for deer but did cut down on the rabbits. I have a lot less in the yard now. Easy to apply..
790,218,5,"It seems people are finding this useful so I thought I would write another update. This B&D; Hedge Hog Trimmer is a real work horse. As I have mentioned in the comments section, last week I cut through another cord, and it went through it like butter. This time I spliced it. I'm not paying for another 100 foot cord, those things are expensive! LOL. It was an easy fix, and it is wrapped up well enough that I don't think I will have a problem. I should also mention that I still haven't lifted a finger to maintain it, except for oiling the blades once. Yup, once! I'm so happy to have bought this! Just be CAREFUL!!! :-)UPDATE 2/18/2010:Just to update, I have used this to cut through very thick ivy, etc., and it is still going, and cutting fairly well. I should also note that I have not maintained this at all. I have not cleaned or oiled the blades, etc., and it still works very well. I am VERY pleased with this and recommend it VERY highlyThis is a really great trimmer. It handles thick branches very well. I cut half inch branches easily enough. It is well balanced, and I was even able to use it with one hand when I really had to stretch (I would not recommend this, as it is a bit dangerous). One thing that many people do not consider with these electric tools, sometimes, the extension cord releases easily. This is not the case here, I am happy to report. I am very happy I bought this. It makes my hedge trimming very easy. It is easy to maneuver, and I think you will be very happy using this product.June 2008 addition:Okay, almost a year has passed and this thing is still going strong. It cuts like butter....still. It is easily the best garden tool purchase I have made, and I have made some good ones. It does not bog down unless the branches are REALLY thick (read: do not fit between the teeth completely). Look no further and buy this trimmer. It's just great....the only annoyance is that the plug comes out easily using my new extension cord.....ehem....it seems while I was using the trimmer to clear out more ivy than anyone can imagine, the cord got hidden underneath some of the iyv I had not reached and when I did get to it I might not have been.....ehem....paying as much attention.....cough, cough....as I should have, and, well, you know, ehem, the trimmer stopped working. When I looked down I saw the cord was still plugged into the trimmer, but then I noticed the dangling piece of cord about 8 feet down and am happy to report that if needed this thing will cut through a 12 gauge extension cord with ease and better than any wire cutter! Luckily for me, I did not get any kind of shock, etc., (of course, it was plugged into a GFCI outlet). That's the good news. The bad news is I threw out the extension cord which, at 100 feet, costs almost what the trimmer cost. The good news is my friend later informed me that it is an easy fix to splice the wires back together. Bad news is, he told me this AFTER the garbage men took the garbage.....Lesson learned, and I only mention this in the hopes that everyone who reads this takes better care than I did. All joking aside, this could have had a completely different ending, and I am quite lucky to be able to edit this review. I can only imagine what might have happened if I were standing in a puddle, or something (I don't want to test the GFCI). So, since it only cost me a new extension cord, I figure I got away cheap. ;-)"
56,795,5,"This feeder is even smaller than I expected, and I like it that way. We don't get a lot of hummingbirds where I live, so filling a larger feeder is a waste. Especially in the warmer weather, when you're supposed to change the sugar solution regularly to keep it from going bad.The feeder has a nice wide mouth on top, so it's easy to fill. Just pour in the sugar water and screw the cap on tight. Then you can put a little water in the moat on the cap to catch any ants that might be attracted to the feeder.So far I love this tiny feeder. It even comes with a little S-hook taped inside the lid, so it's ready to hang in your favorite spot. The plastic pieces at the bottom that come apart for cleaning seem a little flimsy, but only time will tell. For now, five stars, to be adjusted if necessary."
1041,239,5,"These traps have not changed much in centuries of use. They work every time and can be reused if you are so inclined. My favorite part is setting them and the angst that comes with knowing that if you screw it up you will get snapped. It's all part of the sport. To be fair, I think you have to place yourself at some kind of risk, be it ever so slight."
866,178,5,"Loved it! Easy to use and a whole lot safer! Sometimes you just need a smaller saw but this one is no push over , it cut through everything I threw at it and was hungry for more. Good buy for sure."
1336,385,5,I must confess that this mitt is somewhat stiff but when you learned to use it uding the first usage you will never be without it. I use the mitts for my charcoal and gas Weber grills as well as with my Dutch Ovens. They always have well protected my hands and lower arms from burning.The material is comfortable on the skin and I like very much using them. Good value for money.
1483,838,3,"I like this hose.  It's unique design make it perfect for those places where space is tight and those occasions when you need to quickly rinse something down and put the hose away quickly.  For example, it's perfect for washing down our boat at the slip because it's so lightweight and takes up so little space when not in use.  However, it's really not durable enough for everyday use.  The first one I had failed after about 10 uses.  The hard plastic connector eventually cut into the fabric rendering the hose useless.Regardless of the issues I had with the first one, I bought another specifically for the boat dock where a regular hose takes up too much space.  I'll be more careful with this one and try to make it last.Pros:  Small, lightweight, doesn't kink or tangleCons: Not very durable"
1685,878,1,This device did not work very well. I followed the instructions to the dot and It never killed a thing. Rats and Mice were not fooled by this device.
304,343,5,"I am so delighted with this ULTOMATO TOMATO PLANT CAGE! I've used the wire circular tomato cages for more than 25 years, and every year my tomato plants far exceed the height of the cage, resulting in the cage tipping over, tomato plants breaking or tomatoes laying on the ground. This tomato cage, however, is 5 feet tall and, although plastic, very sturdy. The legs of the cage plant firmly into the ground, which should result in no more tipping. Although my tomato plants aren't at full height at this point in the growing year, I expect little or no tomato plant to rise above this cage. It's about time someone came along with a better tomato cage! I will be back to buy several more!"
1284,196,4,"I'll be honest:  I don't really like giving products 5 stars unless I really think they stand far above the competition and/or I can see that its doing a fantastic job.  The problem with this Deer Off is that I'm not completely sure if deer are avoiding some plants because they've been sprayed with it, or because...well, it's summer in the pacific northwest and everywhere you look there's plenty of OTHER green things to eat.Giving it the benefit of the doubt:  deer haven't eaten the plants sprayed with this stuff.But be weary:  the deer haven't eaten nearby plants that haven't been sprayed with this stuff, either.On the other hand:  my property has 4 deer living in the ""back 40"" that routinely like to snack on everything.  there are, without a doubt, deer nearby.At any rate, if you're buying this concentrated stuff, but sure to:1.  Buy a sprayer of some sort.  You need it to apply this stuff.2.  Plug your nose when mixing.  Rotten eggs and hot peppers are the ingredients, and it smells like it.3.  After mixing into the sprayer that you buy, shake it up well, otherwise you'll get little blobs of congealed...something...that'll clog the nozzle.So far, I'd recommend this stuff, but as fall and winter sets in (and the green goes away), we'll see if the deer will decide that they enjoy the spicy version of my plants."
3,430,5,"These things work pretty well.  I used to use the weber starter cubes.  The only issue i had with the weber cubes was that when you take it out of the package, you get little pieces that break off all over the place.  The main thing i like about these starter squares is that you can break them into smaller pieces and shove them into the charcoal to light it.I always ran into the problem with the weber cubes having to sit them on the ground and burn my grass whereas the starter squares being placed right in the chimney i no longer have that issue.The only thing i dont like about these squares is that they seem to smoke up a lot.  Not an issue tho"
553,615,3,Assembly was fairly painless and everything fit together just like it was expected to. If I hadn't dropped a bolt and lost it I would have gotten the whole thing assembled in 45 min or so. Once I was done I felt a sudden urge to tailgate or go to the park or beach for a picnic but luckily I resisted and actually tried to move the grill first. It was too wide to roll through my patio doors so I had to rotate it and lift it on my own. That's when it struck me... yeah it's more portable than my Weber gas grill but it's not going to fit in my car and it's going to be a nightmare to move around. Maybe if I had a Suburban or a pickup  but I don't. For portability nothing beats a small kettle and briquettes.The grilling experience wasn't bad. It heated up very quickly and within 20 min or so I the outside of the cover was registering 300 + degrees and the grate was around 600-700 degrees depending on where exactly I took the reading with my IR thermometer. I decided to thick pork chops that we'd brined for the last 24 hours. I got a great sear on them and then turned the heat down to let them cook through.What really shocked me was the amount of steam and smoke that hit me when I opened the cover to flip or rotate the pork. The flavours were good but the smoke was a little too predominant. Sounds like it's actually part of the grill design that drippings will vaporize. I still got some flareups.Overall I would have rated this grill much more highly if the whole portability angle was dropped.
1093,269,5,"I love Classic Accessories items - we have a grill cover, patio chair covers, and a pontoon boat cover.  All are good quality and they look great.  They last a pretty long time, but the colors do fade, but for items which are out in the sun all the time, I guess that's to be expected.  I'm getting these for my daughter and son-in-law's chaise lounges so they won't have to take the cushions inside every day."
497,376,5,This cover fits easily and perfectly over the Weber Baby Q grill and protects the grill from rain and dirt. The snug fit ensure that it won't be blown away by the wind. Two draw cords let you snug it in further if you want. Seems well made and should last for several seasons.
128,762,5,"These are cool clips. They are a lot bigger than most plant clips which is a good thing. I do a lot of orchids and lilies and these are going to be wonderful. A nice amount in the pack, although they do seem a little pricey. Just staked up one of my orchids that is blooming like crazy and these clips allowed me to gather several stems at one time instead of just one. Easy to close and easy to get back open."
1607,577,3,"I love the idea of this trap.  There is a small opening that the mouse goes through to get to the bait.  When he's inside, a trigger closes the door and the mouse is killed and inside.  You throw away the trap and you're done.  The only problem is that the hole is very tiny.  I have not been able to lure a mouse into the trap with even the smelliest cheese or freshest peanut butter.  Perhaps someplace where the mice are smaller, this would work better.  This is why I gave it three stars instead of one.  There was a time that I killed a mouse that had a family and when the babies were forced out to find food, the standard mousetraps were not sensitive enough to catch them.  In that scenario, this trap would have been ideal and would have worked much better than my house cat."
76,86,4,"Well made and does the job. Unfortunately it doesn't reach all the way to the ground and doesn't have tie-downs, but other than that it works great."
717,878,4,"I have tried all sorts of traps, but after moving to Tucson I found all sorts of pack rats digging holes for no apparent reason.  I decided to give the Rat Zapper a chance and found it works well.  The pros are that it works well, is small, easy to ""load"" (I use dry dog food pellets), and very easy to ""unload"" and clean.  Cons are few, it does use 4 D alkaline batteries - expensive, but long lasting.  It also needs to be kept clean, or the electronics will fail.  Just clean it quickly after a catch. (no big deal).  The main problem or possible problem is that the machine needs to be kept in a dry location.  Rain will ruin it very fast.I leave it under a shelter where the pack rats seem to survive, even then I put a cardboard over the top.  The electronics are on top, so be careful.  Keep it dry!  If not you will find it was an expensive experiment.I recommend it for mice and larger critters.  It would be too small for squirrels I think.  Very useful in the Tucson area, for sure!  It is a great idea and works well."
60,941,4,"My wife loves gardening and we don't have a sprinkler system, so we have to use hoses all the time, which means unwinding, rewinding, etcetera.  The Rumfort Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is a real blessing, because it's lighter, more compact, more attractive, and makes the chore so much easier.  Simply attach the female coupling to the water source, turn the on-off valve to off, turn the water at the source by slowly increasing the pressure, and the hose will automatically expand to approximately 50 feet.  The solid brass valve can be adjusted to get a powerful spray, but is designed to attach a sprinkler too.  Simply follow the basic instructions, attach the sprinkler while the valve is off, face the sprinkler away from you, place it where needed, and turn the valve on.  However, it is not recommended that you use a high pressure nozzle or pressure washer, so this may be an issue for some people - hence the 4-stars.  When finished watering, allow the water in the hose to flow out by leaving the valve on, and the hose will shrink to a smaller size.Warnings found in the instructions are, that it is not intended for drinking water; do not stretch or expand when empty; do not run hot water through it; do not leave hose under pressure with water on if not in use; and keep hose indoors and dry during winter."
720,874,3,"This is lovely in concept for a small starter garden and/or a project with kids. Its a nice assortment of compatible plants for lovely salad fixings. The kit and information is befitting the Miracle-Gro name and quality so you can't go wrong in MOST cases. With the weird weather across the country and the timing of getting your kit you really CAN GO WRONG and produce NOTHING.Before purchase, visit the groables(dot)com website - PLANT area specifically- to make sure you have: 1. enough days until harvest at the ideal soil temperature after Spring frost and until Fall Frost to produce a harvest for each plant type. 2. the ideal soil temperature during that time frame to support plant growth. 3. The watering freedom to compensate for drought or other issues. 4. a fighting chance to bring the plants to maturity.I share this information because I DIDN'T do the research until the kit was selected and on its way to me. Although using planters, containers and sprinkling can for discrete watering (to avoid drought-restriction fines of $200 and up) AND to grow some of these plants, I cannot control the Texas heat and the soil temperatures. We're having 100+ degree days and rarely below 80 degrees at night. SEE GROW areas of the website which are helpful as well.I've opted to wait until the summer heat breaks and see which plants may have a chance before the Fall frost and update you on my findings. I'm giving this kit a temporary 3-star rating UNTIL I can actually put it through its paces and evaluate it thoroughly."
1525,344,4,"The current picture photo shows folding wings which can extend out to turn the compost.  The unit I received has no moving parts, but a welded piece that goes out into two posts.  Ultimately I'm happier with this design as it feels like it has much less change of breaking.  Although based on the looks of the 'winged' one it appears as it might have been easier to insert into the compost pile.It gets the job done, allowing you to insert it into the compost pile, turn and get it worked up.  I have let my compost bin go too long all to often, forgetting to rotate and move the compost, but this aerator is an easy way to get it stirred up."
1400,822,1,"This is my second Weber purchase (Genesis was the first).  Based on the Consumer Reports review I purchased this blindly.  It is a low end version of the Genesis.  The major bummer was that it came with dents in just about every part of the grill.  It was especially bad in the hood where it was very visible.  I wished I had purchased it locally so that I could return it.  After the grill was out of the box and spread out on my deck the ""genie was out of the bottle"" and I put it together.Lastly, it is smaller than most three burner grills.  With a family of 5 and the need to grill pizza, it has a small surface size that we could have worked with but not the size I expected.It was very easy to put together if you are worried about that.  It took about 2 hours.My last review, I gave my Genesis 5 stars... Would definitely not buy Spirit again."
842,577,2,"While this product is easy to use, it is really nothing more than a glorified standard mouse trap housed in a box. A couple of times the trap was sprung but no mouse inside which made it really useless. I've used other mouse traps that had a clear container which were more useful.Above all, I still recommend just using D-con over these types of traps."
430,857,5,"I actually got the kit for Troy Built mowers and loved it so much I ordered this kit for another mower. I'm the kind of person who buys a device and runs it until it dies. I often don't do maintenance on them mainly because I don't think about it until after its too late. This kit makes maintenance easy by giving you the fuel stabilizer, air filter, oil, spark plug and place to drain the oil into and it turns a dreaded saturday afternoon task into a 15 minute tune up. It has brought my mower back to full strength and this is a mower I've used for around 5 years with no maintenance. It's amazing to hear the difference in the engine and is making me wish they would put this on auto delivery so that it would ship to me each season so I don't have to think about it!Great concept, worked amazingly well as long as you order the right kit, the only real difference that I can tell is the shape of the air filter. If you aren't sure what type of filter you need, pull it out and compare it to the pictures to identify which one looks right. For me the spark plug was an afterthought but it was a perfect match once I found the right air filter type."
1599,577,3,"Compared to the ""traditional"" wooden base snap trap, the Victor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trap has these negative characteristics:-  it doesn't seem that the killing bar has as much force as a regular snap trap.-  you can't make sure of the adjustment of the trigger (particularly if you want to make sure it has a ""hair trigger"").  Unlike a traditional snap trap, you can't observe the action to make sure everything is in working order.  It was an interesting decision to make it opaque instead of transparent or translucent.-  if the mouse doesn't die right away, you are throwing away a wounded mouse, to die later in the trash.-  it's probably the most expensive single-use trap on the market.  You will not be able to remove the dead mouse (to be fair, this IS the point of the trap... to make sure that the mouse, any fluids, and all parasites REMAIN enclosed).  You would probably want a less expensive design if you were dealing with a major infestation.-  There's a lot of waste, both in the plastic trap itself and in the packaging.-  The single door doesn't provide the same access opportunity as with a properly-placed snap trap (perpendicular and adjoining to a wall, where the mouse can approach from both directions).On the positive side:-  it is very attractive in design, ready for the kitchen.-  it is dog, cat, and kid-proof.-  Fluids and parasites should stay inside.  Smells (if the mouse is left inside to rot) will still emanate, but should be minimized.  I think it will be very difficult for flies to lay any eggs on the carcass.-  There should be no biological contamination left behind.-  It's hard to determine whether fleas will be 100% prevented from escaping because the door is not sealed like the bait access port with an O-ring, but it would be very rare for fleas to escape.-  It is quieter than a traditional snap trap.  Have one go off while you're in the next room, and you'll know what I mean.This trap should be very attractive to the home or apartment owner who is fearful about dealing with a dead mouse.  And while expensive, if the alternative would be to hire a pest control company, this is much more economical."
1009,538,5,"They work. Very straight forward and simple. Most importantly, the plants seem to really like them. And, the price is about as good as I've found for quality Hydro nutes in small quantities for hobbyists.I found the chart on the side to be easy to follow. Although the writing is really tiny so hopefully there's a better version on their website for printing."
715,298,2,"We have an intermittent rat problem in my neighborhood. It's partly intermittent because one of the neighbors puts down a lot of poison.  As we have pets, this is not an option.We tried this trap on numerous occasions. The set- up is pretty easy.  We never caught a rat or anything else in here.  Could be they were too smart or could be the neighbor got them all... but it didn't work for us."
1605,514,4,"Update March 28, 2012:  Over the winter we stored this machine inside (minus the propane tank, of course) and covered with a sheet.  Starting it up again this year, we had some trouble getting the machine to give us the green go light.  Had a few conversations with the company's customer service and finally landed a person that provided us with a suggestion that solved our machine's problem.  So, with some TLC and good communication, we are up and running for another season.Update September 15, 2011:  We are still in a severe drought, which would normally mean no mosquitoes.  And for a few weeks, we actually turned the machine off.  But when we started running the sprinkler system every day, we started seeing mosquitoes again. We turned the machine back on and the mosquitoes disappeared.We have learned that the machine is more effective with the attractant.  So if you are going to invest in this machine, plan on getting a supply of the attractant, also.  Do not try to go without it.  Just my opinion, though.Having run this Mosquito Magnet for about five months now, we are still happy with the results.  It is temperamental, though, and it needs TLC:  Battery connections need to be checked weekly.  A one-time heavy rain caused the machine to stop working.Update July 17:  Machine is still working fine.  We've had rain and there have been mosquitoes around, but not where our machine is placed.  Please read through this review--all of it is still true.  The most important piece of advice I can give you:  If you have more than one area of your yard that can breed mosquitoes, then this machine will NOT kill them all.  If you are in doubt, make a diagram of your yard, all its obstacles, all its wet spots, hedges, gardens, etc. and ask the company for advice.  This machine is so very expensive for it to not cover your entire space.....Earlier update is at bottom of review, but the important information is:  It works on biting gnats/no-see-ums!  The bad news is:  This Magnet does not cover an acre if there is a house, garage, lanai or other out-buildings or obstacles on that acre plot.We received our Mosquito Magnet and it's been running smoothly for two weeks now.  We don't know how well it works--long-term.  But, I'm writing this review now, because we're already into mosquito season and there have got to be a lot of people out there thinking about purchasing this product right now--and wondering if the new machines work any differently than those produced in years past.  After reading past years' reviews, I believe prior ""issues"" have been addressed and corrected in the machine we received.I will continue to update the review as we determine how well it works for us--maximum effectiveness takes about a month to achieve, although insects were drawn into the trap immediately--I believe that would be because even though we see dead mosquitoes from the beginning, there are still eggs out there hatching.  So, as of now, I can say that:  The assembly instructions were adequate; all the parts were there; assembly was simple and not time-consuming; we are impressed with the quality of the components; the machine is surprisingly well-engineered; customer service is at your fingertips and pleasant; the machine is running just fine, and biting insects are attracted into the net.BUT, before you buy a Mosquito Magnet you should give its placement some hard thought:  It should be upwind and 30-40 feet from where people normally congregate; it must be located between breeding areas and people areas; ideally it should be in the shade, and it should be kept away from water sprinkler spray.  After analyzing these requirements, if you don't have such an area, you might want to rethink the investment.I contacted customer service by phone because I had a question.  The rep was polite and informative, even though he gave me an answer that I didn't want to hear.  Our property is about an acre and a half and we live in many parts of our yard:  On the front porch, on the back deck, in the veggie gardens on one side of the house and out back, and at the grill on the side of the house or the smoker in another area.  There is no ""best location"" to put the Magnet--putting it in one place will not protect us in all the yard areas we use daily. I wanted to know if the Magnet was effective if we moved it around the yard.  His answer:  No, the Magnet is not as effective if you move it around.  It should stay in one place.  But he said that we could go ahead and try it......Well, yeah, we sure can--but that's a lot of money to spend for a questionable outcome.But we'll give it a try anyway.  Since there is no clear-cut placement in our particular situation, we anticipate having a first season of trial-and-error.  But, hey, even if it only eliminates the monster mosquitoes that attempt to carry us away when we walk the dog in the early mornings and late evenings, it will be worth it.Be aware there is an investment here beyond the initial purchase price.  You have to provide the propane tank and refill it every 21 days.  Also, there are nets, attractant and ""Quick Clear"" cartridges to replace every 21 days.  So, between propane and monthly replacements and other enhancements--and the length of your mosquito season, you'll be spending at least a hundred dollars extra each year--probably more.Update May 9, 2011:  Our area in Texas is experiencing drought conditions.  There are not many mosquitoes around.  We placed the Magnet in an area upwind of where we thought mosquitoes would be breeding.  After a week there were many gnats in the net, but not many mosquitoes.  For the past few weeks I have been getting a lot of bites on my legs while working in the garden, and when I was able to catch one little bugger in the act, I realized the culprits were gnat-looking tiny insects.  We moved the Magnet to a position upwind of the main garden, and within an hour it had quite a few of the tiny insects in the net.  The insects don't look like the no-see-ums that I am familiar with from the Virgin Islands, but they sure do bite like them--and the bites really hurt!  And the bites are hot and hurtful for many, many days!  They are worse than mosquito bites.So there are two observations I can now make:  1.)  The Magnet is attracting biting insects; and, 2.)  The Magnet may cover an acre if the area is wide open, but it does not cover an acre if there are buildings, lanais, or other obstacles around.  Do you spend your time outdoors in just one part of your yard?  And can you place the Magnet in the shade, upwind and 30'-40' away from people?  If you can answer ""yes"" to both those questions, well then, maybe this is the machine for you--otherwise you may want to rethink your options.We still have faith that this machine will perform to our satisfaction--with a few ""give and takes"" in our ultimate rationalization of ""our satisfaction"".  So, I am leaving my rating at four stars."
1348,520,5,Easy to open and close. Well engineered and quality product. SHARP!!!Cuts through a two inch diameter doug fir in 5 seconds. The blade is thin but strong. As long as you don't try to push it through wood it's plenty thick enough. Fits easily in overalls side leg pocket. Superb!
887,649,5,"Learning the pool chemistry stuff is kind of mind boggling really.  How much of this for how big of a pool and how often, what is shock? Ph up, ph down free chlorine.  This at least gives me a reasonable idea of being in the ballpark and is fairly affordable.  I have a bleached out spot in the liner but no ones bathing suit has bleached out and no one has had red eyes or infections so I guess I must be doing something right."
96,298,2,"To repeat what others have said, the battery compartment is terrible!The curved top has grip ridges that are useless, I had to pry the top off.Once inside the battery holder defies imagination, curved plastic meant to hold the batteries impede the insertion of the batteries which barely fit in the plastic holder that isn't even the same piece of plastic of the ""trap"".This really does look like a hobbled together prototype!Following the prototype model, wires inside the trap are exposed, if a rat found this device unarmed, I would expect it to be disabled due to chewing on the exposed wires which are connected to the shock plates.The trap entrance is quite large, an adult can easily insert their hand, perhaps making it easy to clean, but also seemingly dangerous if there is enough of a shock here to kill a rat. However, this seems like it would be effective for chipmunks or squirrels as well..There is no bait holder, you simply smear some through the large holes on the opposite side. These holes are actually large enough to allow a mouse in which could explain why some user report bait loss with no kill.It is also not very apparent that the trap has been triggered. tiny, dim blinking led? Great idea, so I have to get into the small area to check or pull it out daily?Opportunities for improvement:1) Battery cover2) Battery holder3) exposed wires in the rodent area4) I would make the shock plates removable for cleaning, with wires hidden under the plates soldered to something that would make contact with the plate when installed.5) Needs a removable bait holder for easier cleaning6) Smaller grid on non entry side ( or bait in center with dual entry )7) Personally I would add flap doors to each side that would make the apparent entry smaller, rodents are more curious about entering enclosed spaces with the smell of food inside, the large open end is not ideal.8) Audible beep, like a low battery smoke alarm, should be used to identify either low battery or after the device has been triggered and needs to be checked."
492,118,3,"This pad could be larger and thicker. It seems a little overpriced for what you get. When they say ultra light, they aren't kidding. I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake. It survived, but was the worse for wear."
162,339,5,"Used this to kill weeds and grass which were growing between the stones on my patio. In two days, they had turned yellow. It is &#34;extended control&#34; killer- will update if it has to be re-sprayed. So far, am well pleased with the product, and can recommend."
695,838,4,"After seeing some reviews before me, I was bracing myself for the worst, but I've had a great time with this hose (so far used about a month). I use it to go around my backyard filling up Earthboxes. It's so much easier letting the water drain and watching the hose recoil to what looks like less than 20 feet instead of having to recoil and untangle the regular hose. There are no tangle issues with this since it's so easy to sort out once emptied and shortened. The hose end isn't bulky so it fits easily within the diameter of the Earthbox fill tubes so there isn't any extra water spraying outside the tube and getting lost. I used some teflon tape around the connection to the water spout and haven't had any problems with leaks. Even the spray strength on my hose has met and perhaps gone farther than my expectations. I had a maggot-infested trash bin outside that I wanted a STRONG spray of water to clean out, and this hose did the job for me.The only thing I have worries about is the hose end is made of plastic, not metal. I am fairly gentle with the hose - I don't just drop the hose end onto the ground when done using it, I place it on the ground so there's no great impact to the head. I did accidentally smack the end of the hose against concrete which seemed to create a small leak for a moment, but a few times of closing and opening the valve at the end seemed to make it go away. I have not had any issues with leaks since so I assume all will be well as long as I avoid strong impacts in the future. Take care of the hose and it will work for you."
1543,842,5,"Rooting Hormone is a lot of fun, because it makes it easy to turn cuttings into plants.  If you see a plant at a friend's house that you'd like, just take a cutting, and try rooting it (rooting hormone works on most plants, but not all, in my own experience).The amount in this inexpensive little jar will treat maybe a few hundred+ cuttings, because you only need a small dip into the powder of a cut stem.  A nice touch is the inner seal to keep it fresh until you first open it.  If you know an avid gardener who doesn't have this stuff, it would be a nice gift which will yield long-lasting pleasure."
1292,723,4,More fun than a barrel of monkeys! These arrived happy and healthy on the third business day after ordering. I was worried about the heat in the mailbox but if you follow the tracking info (yes there is tracking with the cheap shipping. Don't believe the notice to the contrary) you can get them right away. They were about as healthy and happy as a bunch of bugs can be! They were downright rambunctious. They have a distinct aroma that reminded me of my childhood and a jars of ladybugs we would collect. The packing was perfect with ample ventilation and some shavings inside to cushion them.  I suggest that you get a batch just for the fun of it.  I released them after sunset and squirted the bug food around. They are self dispensing. All it takes id a small slit in the mesh and they all crown through it. They start eating right away.  In the morning I was able to find seven of them. I am sure there are more somewhere though. Here in Palm Beach County in May it is 82 degrees Fahrenheit at sundown so they aren't slowed down by cool temps and they can still fly. We also have an army of small hungry lizards who welcome anything that moves. I am going to get more bugs! I may try the Coca Cola to glue the wings closed trick so they stay put and hope the lizards aren't the problem. I'll add to the review and let you know if there are any long term bugs.PSNo bugs left at all. It was still worth it for entertainment.
1311,850,1,"There is no way to attach the body to the base.  No screwing threads, no clamps, nothing.  It is completely useless, as it cannot be put together.  Save your money!"
597,296,4,"Only in the ground for a couple months.  Like everyone says, lay it out in the sun for 30 minutes or so and it will get a lot softer adn easier to work with.  I will have to update later in teh year but from the quality this stuff looks pretty tough.  Much better than the ugly black stuff that you see everywhere."
1418,704,5,"Bought this because I want drinking water-safe hose which I don't have to fight with.This one replaces 2 others which were only a few dollars cheaper...guess you get what you pay for.No kinks, no twisting, easy to use. Nice product."
290,435,5,Works on blck drip line but you must leave cap off. Downhill slop is enough to releas 4gals in 90min daily. Using a dual outlet seems to defeat drip action by splitting the 4 gallons
954,912,5,"I've had the Baby Q for about 6 months now and we still love it. The craftsmanship is superb. This is portable enough to put in the truck and take anywhere. Even heat, easy light, perfect grilling all the time. It has been exposed extensively to the elements in Florida and shows no signs of rust or wear. In fact, it still looks brand new.This was a great purchase."
1392,66,4,"This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5"" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it's a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it's made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price."
997,80,5,"**Update February 2013**  I've had this racket for 5 years and it's still functioning as it should.  I change the batteries maybe once a year, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.**Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods, complete with creek.  My targets include gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and perhaps the occasional wasp.  Gnats are vaporized, moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket, and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago, a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him.  He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily.  This morning, I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp.  I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade, and the moth flew right into it.  I can't imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too!The only negative I've noticed is that when I'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I'm not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn't budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.**Update** August 2009: I've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn't bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I'm willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2"", but it has never slid off completely so I don't worry about it.  I'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I'll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations."
474,949,5,"I did receive this product in exchange for a review, with no compensation.  This is a great addition to our Bar-B-Que tool arsenal.  When it arrived, I was a little leery of the lack of care/clean up instructions on the packaging.  However I rinsed it under running water then just put the screw off mop head in the dishwasher. It came out perfectly clean, without loosing the first string. (Flash back to many a bad string mop experience!)This mop does come with two heads that very easily screw on and off for replacement. That is great for various reasons, the main being the ability to baste meat and vegetables with a different brush. It  provides great coverage on the meat . We used it on ribs and it couldn't have performed better.  We then swapped the head to baste the zucchini with an olive oil herb mix. It was superb for both uses. The handle is of a length that keeps your hands away from the heat.The only suggestion I could offer is to add those clean up instructions to the packaging. Just to take the guess work out of it."
801,897,4,"This is a nice bird feeder, but you need to be aware what you're getting.First of all, you can only fill this with fairly large feed, e.g. sunflower seeds or peanuts. Regular small-grain birdfeed will be too small and just pour through the holes.Secondly, as the birds eat, lots of little bits of the feed (sunflower seed shells in my case) will fall down, so try to hang this above an area where you don't mind the mess. (I first had it on our patio, then moved it so it hangs above an area where plants and flowers grow so the little bits of food just hit the soil instead of junk up the patio).As long as you're aware of these two facts, this bird feeder should work well for you. We have several birds who visit it regularly, and it's a lot of fun to see them sit inside the little &#34;tunnels&#34; and pick at the food."
688,924,3,We are in south eastern pa and we have over a dozen bird feeders. I have had this feeder up for about a month and the birds do not use it until they need to. My other feeders are empty with in days. This one stays full for weeks.It's a clever idea though for a small area. I recommend securing to the post versus hanging from the hook. The birds really did not like it when it sort of swung back and forth.
1000,434,2,"As others have pointed out, this item has several flaws - including labeling it ""copper"", since it's simply a copper-colored paint over plastic.The second flaw is a lack of drainage, and if you live in a rainy climate, you'll want to be careful to drill some drainage holes, otherwise you'll get some messy birdseed. I used a 1/16"" drill bit and put three holes in the bottom of each tray - now it drains fine.The third flaw, which I haven't found a good solution for, is this. Depending on how you mount it, the feeder can be easily unbalanced, causing seed or water spills. I can't take credit for figuring this one out - the squirrels that live in my yard found out that by sitting near one edge of the feeder, it tips onto its side and most of the contents spill out.It's an attractive product I suppose, but seems to require some TLC to get the best out of it."
177,644,5,"We have had the worst problem in our garage with a pack rat(s).  My husband had set rat traps, gopher traps, everything we could think of and then I got this trap.  So easy to set my 12 year old baited it with refries and set it in the garage.  Next morning there was the rat!  No more poop everywhere.  No more items chewed or missing!  Yippee!!!!  Setting it again right now in case there are others.  Highly recommend.We have now caught 5 packrats and are still going.  This trap is great!"
1145,737,4,"I bought this guy after moving into a house from an apartment and quickly realized I would need to tackle the backyard. I remember growing up all the pains my dad went through to fix our gas lawn mower and didn't want to go through all that again. Not to mention I wanted to try a product that was greener. Thankfully, technology has progressed and now they have these electronic guys but I was still skeptical. Overall, it does what I purchased it for... cutting the grass. Here are some ups and downs:Pros: Green technology. Don't have to hassle with gas, oil, spark plugs, etc. QUIET! I was surprised how little sound a lawn mower can make. Blade technology is great, I never have to go over parts of the yard twice. Lighter so easir to push. So far have had no maintance to speak of, I'll follow up if something comes up.Cons: SMALL. I guess I should have realized the width is the first measurement listed but it's even smaller in person. While I've learned to deal with it, just realize it takes more strips to mow your yard. The reason I have it four stars though, was the battery life. I have a 1/4 acre yard. Depending on where you are in the country that's a big or small plot. The first time when I went through on normal blade settings it ran out of juice about halfway through. Now I use it on quiet or economical mode and can usually get through the yard without having to recharg. But if you think you have a bigger yard invest in a wider base or bigger battery.BOTTOM LINE: great product to cut a small yard, low hassle, green tech. Width and battery leave something to be desired but that's why they have bigger models."
1671,233,3,After a few uses the blades no longer slide tightly against one another - so partly-cut branches slip between blades. You get what you pay for - should have bitten the bullet and purchased a Felco.
68,77,4,Given the price and the length of time these each work....you have a 2-3 year supply.  Store them in the same box used to store the zapper &#34;off-season&#34; - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN.
562,299,4,I used these with my Weber Smokey Mountain 22.5 and enjoyed the smoke flavor.  I think it could have been even more but still worked out very well!
1464,932,5,I am very happy with this feeder. I loved that the nectar was included for quick set up! Just mix and go. It is simple and easy to take apart and clean. The bee guards and perches sealed the deal. It is lightweight and eye catching.A great option for a first hummingbird feeder.
1366,768,5,"There are so many similar Tomcat items that it is confusing what differentiates them. This Tier 1 station is primarily distinguished by its ability to be refilled rather than tossed after one use. Like the disposable ones, it is designed with a little tunnel, so kids and pets can't easily get to the poison inside. It is excellent in that regard and not dangerous to have in an area where people are walking by. I am very happy with them so far."
0,476,5,This is a surprisingly effective and clever device for keeping ants away from the hummingbird feeder. It is easily installed and works flawlessly. A very fine product at a modest price.
1639,622,5,"Every year I fight the snails for control of my vegetable garden....I've tried beer (very little success); picking them & squishing them - (yuck & it's really hard to keep up since they like to feed in the dark) & other bait that disappears with the rain/watering.  Finally, this is a product that sticks around for a few weeks & actually works.I sprinkled it in my garden & within a few minutes I noticed snails feeding on it.  I guess they like this stuff.  I like that it is not toxic to other animals & can be used in my vegetable garden.  It took a couple days, but then I started seeing empty shells - it works!"
960,841,5,"This will be another ongoing review, as I'm sure it will take a few weeks for any real results to appear. Every year I have to dig up weed that grow between the concrete slabs on my driveway, and front walk, as well as the sidewalk in front of my house. This year I'm going to apply Foaming Edger to these areas, and hope that I won't have to go out there every couple of weeks to pull up the weeds and grass that grow between the cracks.I made the first application last night (it's the first time in a week that there is no rain in the forecast), and used maybe a 1/4 of the can. I will continue to modify this review as the ""growing"" season gets underway.**2nd and final review - This foaming edger worked really well. As stated above I sprayed this in the seams of my concrete driveway, and to date nothing has grown where I've sprayed. I've already ordered a second can to apply to my sidewalk and the walkway that runs alongside my house."
922,767,4,"These are not likely to be investigated and messed with by a kid or a pet (cat or a dog), can kill multiple mice at once (up to 12), and can be used both indoors and outdoors.I like that these come pre-loaded and are disposable. With this product, you can just kill all the mice and never need to touch the poison.They eat the poison from the station and die elsewhere. The biggest problem with this product and with poisoning mice (besides the inhumane treatment of poisoning mice) is that cats or dogs cat then eat the dead mice and then the pets die that way. Although this product is good at making sure that children and other pets do not get to the poison, the fact that the mice will die somewhere in the house and might be then eaten by your pets who will then die is scary.Also, it should be noted that although 12 seems like a large number, mice tend to exist in large families so one of these stations might not solve the problem in your house or barn."
543,412,5,not a toy but a functional part of my polaris. I refill once per year and have to put this scubber on the tail of the polaris about every 2-3 weeks. someone had suggested using a noodle but I think the noodle as it would wear down with make a mess in the pool. been using this product for many years. price is right and can't go wrong
1352,489,4,"For years my parents have had wasp problem in the garage and backyard.  I bought this WHY TRAP earlier this spring in hopes that it would help eliminate part of the problem.  Initially I didn't catch any wasps with it.  However, I moved the trap to a different location in the yard and several days later had caught two wasps, a bee, some flies, and lots of Japanese lady bugs.  After empting the trap and refilling it with orange juice instead of water, we caught over twenty wasps.  I know there are websites that one can go to and see how to make a wasp trap using a two-liter bottle and a few other supplies, but I'm not a very good with crafts.  I bought this trap for a discount and using apple or orange juice instead of water seems to really help in catching wasps.  I like the design of the trap and for around $10, it's really not that bad of a deal.  It does work, but it's just a matter of placing it in a good location."
1440,415,4,"The Yard Butler Hose Truck is easy to assembly, easy to use and a great product to have around. There is nothing I hate worse about yard work is rolling up a muddy hose after a rain storm, or trying to roll &#34;hose rollers&#34; around the yard with their tiny wheels. The Yard Butler relieves that burden. The Yard Butler was easy to assemble and the extra large wheels are great for moving your hose around the yard. The long handle make it easy to roll around and the crank is easy to turn and roll the hose. It is a must have for any yard."
417,167,4,"This is a pricey solution - literally and figuratively - for people looking to rid their lawns and gardens of deer, rabbits, and other pesky critters. Part of the reason for that cost, however, is the inclusion of a surprisingly handy battery powered sprayer. Potential buyers might wonder if something like that is worth the extra cost, and I would say that for anybody with severe arthritis or other issues that make spraying or sprinkling this kind of product a painful exercise, the expense is worth it. The sprayer works very well, and it not only reduces the effort involved in spraying the repellent, it makes the job go a lot faster. Just be prepared to spend a little extra money on batteries - this thing will use a lot of them over the course of an outdoor season."
1625,167,4,"(Original Text: April 20, 2013)I hate how my spring flowers are devoured by hungry rabbits as they emerge in the spring and I was very happy that none of the protected plants have been gnawed on this year.The ""Deer-off"" spray is easy to apply and the big bottle I have of it will last me the entire season and maybe even more.I was afraid that it would smell ghastly when I sprayed it on my plants, but I didn't notice much of an odor at all. I don't have a problem with deer eating my plants, so I can't say how suitable it is for that, but it seems to work very well for repelling rabbits. The only thing I've needed to do is to refresh the spray on the plants after a rainfall.The only negative thing I have to say is that the included batteries were completely dead and I needed to insert 4 fresh alkaline batteries.Update: Aug, 2013I've been spritzing my garden vegetables over the summer and it's done a good job keeping the critters at bay. I'm pretty happy :)"
1506,246,5,"While I did not buy mine on Amazon (I bought at HD or Lowes), I wanted to give a positive review for this connector. I have used mine for at least three seasons without any problems. The on and off valves close completely and do not leak. They allow for a precise amount of water control so you can get just the amount of flow you want (good for soaker/weeper hoses). One thing I really like is the collar that threads onto the spigot. It has three little pieces of rubber that stick out and allow you to get a good grip for attaching to the spigot. Some other Y-connectors I have do not have this and are much more difficult to get on and eliminate all leaks."
768,268,5,"This is incredibly well made for the cost.  I love the different cinches and clips.  I'd been planning on putting a rock on top so it wouldn't blow away, but it has clips you can wrap around the legs which is perfect for the windy area we live in.  The cover repels water well.  I couldn't be happier."
569,619,5,"I am now on my third packet. Very convenient. Cut a small corner on the packet and pour into your feeder (Mine is a Perky-Pet 209 30 ounce glass feeder). Add water, shake until dissolved and then hang. Popular with the hummingbirds (Rufus here) and no problems with other birds of bees. I did find it surprising how aggressive the hummers are with each other around the feeder."
140,370,5,This is the perfect set for grilling and it does not feel cheap. I think the quality of the material is the best thing I love about this product. Must have.
1540,617,5,"Nothing I've used has worked as well for me. I'm no expert. A portion of my lawn had been taken over with clover and creeping charlie.  I applied Spectracide Weed Stop. It took a couple of weeks but the weeds are gone, completely. And I was pleasantly surprised to find that I still had grass. The grass was just covered with the clover and creeping charlie. I know of nothing else that kills creeping charlie without doing a complete kill.You do need to be careful and make sure you are not using it on a form of grass that it will harm. there are some lawn grasses that can't take the punishment this product doles out to weeds. As always read and follow the label. I like the concentrate and use my own sprayer, not those bottles that hook up to a hose. I've never had any luck with those products. I'm sure others have, however. Like I said, I'm no lawn expert. But am I happy to see my creeping charlie dead."
342,15,5,"I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push."
1630,167,4,"I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision. White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer, I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas, day lilies, and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I sprayed three times in a six-month period through early fall with one extraspraying after three days of heavy rain. The battery-powered sprayer worked welland was easy to control. You do need to shake the container well before and duringuse so that the sprayer will not clog up. I had to unscrew the nozzle and clean it upa few times but that wasn't a big problem. The product smells pretty bad as you arespraying, but the odor goes away quickly (at least for humans) once it dries.All in all Deer-Off is an effective product that will help keep deer from eating yourplants. Bear in mind that flowers and new growth that come out after you spray arenot treated and are subject to getting munched. You have to stay on top of thingsand spray after big rains as well."

1651,7,4,"It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied."
1514,713,4,This bait station can be used indoors and outdoors. I like the Tomcat Mouse Killer II because it's prefilled and you don't have to touch the bait but it is made to be used indoors only. This pack is the Tomcat Mouse Killer I and can be used indoors and outdoors. It comes with one refillable bait station and 8 bait refills. I like the design of Tomcat's bait stations because the mice can get into the chamber that contains the bait but children and pets cannot. The station itself is a plastic container that is sectioned off with the bait to one side and a small hallway of sorts on the other. It is child and pet proof because only a small mice would be able to fit into the hallway of the station.

431,924,3,It seems to do the job but I have two main concerns with this type of feeder:1. Very small perching space so more than one bird feeding is difficult thus less of a &#34;show&#34;.2. My particular feeder's top cover does not close very easily. I need to press the transparent cover down pretty hard to make it close and even then it's not perfectly horizontal.
752,725,5,We live on a small ranch and mice can really be a problem. This is the best non poison solution I have found. They hold great. I have never had a critter come off one. We just lay them flat in a line like a sticky moat.These have really helped us. They are an awesome deal.
1544,154,5,"I own this scoop, use it for putting lump charcoal in and taking ash out of myWeber 721001 Smokey Mountain Cooker 18.5-Inch SmokerWorks great, perfect size, constructed to last forever, aluminum so it won't rust.

143,906,4,"I am greatly annoyed by a constantly kinking hose or an inflexible hose.  This hose promised to provide maximum kink resistance.  Does it deliver?  Yes, mostly.Before this hose, I went to the Big Box Store and paid over 5 ten dollar bills for a premium hose.  The result - after one year of use, it was leaking from the connector (where it connects to the hose material), it kinks every time I use it and it has become stiff as a board.  Its last act of defiance was developing a crack and leaking somewhere down the line.I almost wrote a bad review for this hose 2 days after I received it.  When I first hooked it up, getting this hose to stay on my hose hanger was like wrestling with a boa constrictor.  It wanted to go its own way and I couldn't get it to stay where I wanted it when stretched out.  So I stretched the hose out and let it stay fully extended for 2 days...now it is very easy to manage.I am impressed that this hose is drinking water safe, probably because it is lead-free.  I don't drink from a hose but it is good to know it does not contain trace amounts of lead.  I am also impressed by the connectors on this hose - top quality.  I'm willing to bet this thing will last a while.After a week of use, I find that this hose still kinks from time to time but mostly behaves.  It is light years better than the one I had before.  My only regret is not buying the 75' length."
1146,896,5,this product is great.  used it in montana at the property.  put it on the hood of the vehicle while i was doing things and it recharged my dumb phone within a hour.  would be a good product to have if you travel the back country to charge any portable devise.
1149,334,3,"This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know."
384,855,4,"I have been using theTroy-Bilt TB154E 9-Inch 6.5-Amp Electric Garden Cultivator/Tillerfor the last year and have really enjoyed it, except that I can't reach certain areas of my yard since it requires a cord. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to test this. I have several comments concerning this since I have experience with a similar machine.First of all - Assembly - Follow the instructions. Carefully. The most important thing to note is the direction you have the tiller when assembling it and the letters which are on the tines. This could save you a lot of hassle later.You attach the handle, the back wheels, and the tines. Everything popped on. The wheels have a small tube (they call it a flute) that goes through with a small cotter pin (they call it a hitch pin)to hold it in place. During the first use, this assembly came apart and the wheels came off. It comes with two larger (and tighter) cotter pins that you use if you are only using two of the tines for small jobs, so we were able to replace the assembly with one of the large cotter pins. (This is one of the reasons I removed a star)Second - this is a cultivator, not a tiller. It is not intended to break up hard dirt (although it will work at it and get the job done), nor is it intended to till your lawn into the soil. It will do it, but unless the grass is very short, it will get entangled in the tines.Having used both cultivators, I actually prefer this one. The Troy-bilt takes off like a horse, wanting to drag you behind it. Since this runs slower, it is much easier to handle. You use a back and forth motion to slowly break up the ground. This is actually lighter than the Troy-bilt, but still grabs the dirt nicely. It could be the angle.While it does not recommend certain things, we tried anyway. The loose weeds and sod that surrounded the flower bed pulled up easily and quickly. We used it for at least a half hour and the fully-charged battery still functioned.The tines are easy to remove and clean, and as I mentioned in the assembly, you can remove the outside set and run on the inside set.A very nice, lightweight cultivator for the home gardener that will supply most of our needs.While I can't certify to the longevity of this product, it appears to be built well (with the one little problem concerning the cotter pin - easily fixed) and we have had aGreenworks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerfor two years which has lasted well."
1602,713,5,"This product is a set of bait blocks with a case that allows critters to gnaw the bait but protects it from pets etc.  As a protector the case seems OK.  It wouldn't stop a determined dog, but I'd say it'd slow him enough to spot the investigation.  I give the system a thumbs-up.This was deployed a little later in the year than ideal; it's hard to tell if it's getting results.  However the issue imho isn't so much the efficacy of the bait, which is what it is, but the efficacy of the case!  I think it's good."
559,932,5,"This is a good hummingbird feeder and it's a pretty good size for this time of year, when hummingbird migration is over but you've still got a lot of residents and migrants hanging around, not to mention Hatch Year birds. It is easy to construct, as the bee guards snap on, the base with perch handles just twists on and off, and the glass bottle part of it also just twists in and out. Therefore it is also very easy to clean because everything just comes on and off, even the ant guard on top (which also just twists on and off). The feeder comes with a free packet of nectar; just combine with water and you're good to go.I don't know how to really say whether hummingbirds like this feeder better than any other. What I will say, though, is that this is the only hummingbird feeder I have up right now and for the first time ever today I found a Costa's hummingbird (adult male) in my yard. He seems to love it, because he has been defending it for the last seven hours since I found him. He likes to perch about one to two feet away from it to make sure nobody else comes in."
549,337,3,"There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder."
952,159,5,"Last spring my old tire inflater that I had purchased from Northern Tool years ago finally failed me. I was going to order another one from them but then I found this one on Amazon. I was very impressed with the price. It had more features than my old one and it was lower priced plus it was on sale too. What more could a man ask for?This unit has performed flawlessly for me and I believe it's been six months now that I have used it. I love the gauge on it and it's accuracy. I like the fact that I can lock the air outlet on to the the stem of whatever I am inflating. I love the knob allows you to release air without removing the inflator because you over inflated. I like the trigger like lever that releases the air into the tire.This unit should last for years with proper care. It feels and looks like it is made of quality workmanship and material. It just has a good feel to it to me. I don't know how long this tool would last in the hands of someone who abuses their tools. If a tool user is someone who slams their tools around or runs over them with a car because they were in too big a hurry to put the hose up, this tool may not last that long. Quite honestly if I see someone like that working on any of my stuff I will not go back to that garage again unless I think the mechanic is just having a bad day.All in all I think the average person who does most of their own work at home will really like this tool. I have yet to find any negatives on mine."
922,769,3,"I used these on my plants (I have several dozens in my house) and noticed that the leaves were shiny on each plant and that each plant seemed to look even greener than before.Having said that, I am not sure if mineral oil is good for plants. For people, mineral oil is one of the worse things one can put on the skin as it blocks permeability and doesn't allow the skin to breather. It occurs to me that mineral oil might play the same biological role on the plants. This to me would be a sad fact as without being able to breathe in CO2 and breathe out O2, the plants will die (from being unable to photosynthesize).Therefore, I have been afraid of using this product continuously. It adds luster to the plants but I do not want to risk it."
77,946,5,It is good for weed wacking and trimming the yard. It won't do the harder type of weed wacking if it is woody at all. However the battery lasted for about 35 minutes of steady trimming. I have two batteries so I can have at least and hour of work. I did not use the more battery sucking mode nor did I need it.  The best thing about this trimmer you can operate it with one hand if you need to. You certainly still need to be care of flying objects that can be launched by this trimmer.  I think it was a great buy.
713,387,5,The starter works great though I was a little disappointed when I read that it was made in china especially when I read in another review that it was made here thank goodness the grill is still made here anyway it works great some newspaper a few drops of cooking oil 12 min later they were glowing red and ready to go sure beats lighter fluid. Just be careful to not get burned the handle is very good and protects well but if you touch anything else it's an instant severe burn so an oven met is a good idea.
398,184,5,"Who would have ever thought that catching or killing a ground hog would be so much trouble?  My wife insisted that I trap him and take him somewhere else way out in the country.  I purchased a cage and the first night I trapped our pet squirrel who will no longer let us feed him.  The next two nights I trapped the ground hog and he was literally so strong that he bent the metal of the trap door and the wire cage and squeezed out of the trap.  Twice!OK, I purchased a bigger and better trap.  Now the groundhog walks all around it and refuses to eat the gourmet meals I have put into the cage for him.  Not only is he big and strong but he is also smart, wonderful!  Now I feel like Bill Murray in Caddy Shack and the groundhog is winning.  By this time he has eaten all of my wife's flowers, tulip bulbs and potted plants.  Now it is time for war!I can only find one entry hole in the front of our home in the shrubs so I find a large landscaping stone, then I tape two of the smoke bombs onto  a stick and light the fuses and quickly jam them into the hole.  Top it off with the large stone and cover it with some dirt and voila, no groundhog!  Now I am making sure we don't have more of the dirt devils in our yard!I used two of the smoke bombs as the hole was more than 8 inches in diameter and I wanted to make sure that the large volume quickly filled up with smoke."

1291,502,5,"I am unbelievably surprised.  I screwed two Gilmour 75 foot weeper hoses together to cover the front lawn.  I then hooked it up to my sprinkler system, attaching it with a brass connector and teflon to one of the sprayer risers.  Without decreasing too much pressure from the rest of the zone, in 15 minutes, the weeper hose saturated the lawn areas where it was lying.  I imagine it has to be moved around and left on for probably an hour to saturate the entire lawn.  I wanted to install it permanently under the grass, but Gilmour does not recommend leaving it out in freezing winter months."

485,819,5,"I love having a little bonfire on evenings when the weather isn&#8217;t too hot to tolerate it. There is something comforting about sitting by a crackling fire &#8211; especially if you have marshmallows or hotdogs on hand.The CobraCo Copper Mission Fire Pit FBCOPMISN-C is a beautiful fire pit. The copper finish is just stunning. I have had another fire pit from this manufacturer and it was difficult to put together. This model, however, was very easy to assemble, which I am very grateful for.This fire pit comes with the stand, the bowl, a little rack that sits inside the bowl, a spark screen, a spark guard removal tool, and a vinyl cover to keep it protected. My older CobraCo fire pit also came with a cover, which I soon discovered did not keep rain out of the fire pit, and turned into a nice place for mosquitos to breed. This model, however, works much better. It has rained half the month since I got this fire pit and every time I have checked underneath the cover, the bowl was dry.The pit works as well as any other for building fires. The round shape make it easy for several people to gather round &#8211; especially important if you are toasting marshmallows or wieners.CobraCo has really improved a lot with this model and I would highly recommend this fire pit to anyone looking to invest in a really beautiful model that will last a long time."

717,666,5,"I love this grill!  My Char-Broil Red was a big mistake.  That lasted less than 3 years!  This is AMERICAN MADE and worth every penny, my last Weber lasting 16 years.  Weber has nice people that are actually helpful when you need replacement parts, which is seldom.  It assembled in about 1.5 hours with 2 people.  I used it tonight for the first time and I adore it.  The grates are perfect.  Welcome back Weber!  Oh how I missed you.  Just pay a little more, this is obvious quality for the word go!"
1391,809,4,"It&#8217;s really a year in which the critters are running rampant.  I can actually see them skittering into a hole in my foundation.  Of course I&#8217;m not particularly happy with this, but am determined to defeat them this year.  I&#8217;m not quite sure what&#8217;s happening, but another family member just mentioned she is having similar problems.I certainly have the holes to prove I&#8217;ve got them, but the problem isn&#8217;t quite as severe as it has been in the past.  I&#8217;ve made my own homemade concoction, which is somewhat similar to this one.  The natural granular method seems easier to deal with that my Mason jar recipe, but will they quit putting holes in my lawn?  Perhaps the only way I&#8217;ll know that is throughout the summer when I&#8217;m mowing it.The formula is very heavy on the castor oil (I like this), so don&#8217;t know how well it will work.  I&#8217;m doing a combination of treatments this year, all somewhat similar.  I don&#8217;t really wish these little varmints to head for my neighbor&#8217;s houses, but hopefully they&#8217;ll head into an area where they won&#8217;t inconvenience people.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:Castor Oil:  9.9%Lecithin:  1%Fuller&#8217;s Earth:  100%"

949,858,5,"This kit comes with all you need to maintain your Honda mower: the motor oil, air filter, spark plug and a fuel additive.  The packaging also doubles as a funnel and oil pan for your convenience.The positives:  the kit has everything you need to keep your mower running.  I don't think I'd use this kit every year but having gone a few years with no maintenance it's time to change the oil, filter and spark plug for sure.  The negatives: the funnel and oil pan are a bit flimsy so plan on using your own.  Also the fuel stabilizer is measured for five gallons.  I don't typically fill my tank since I don't want the gasoline sitting in the mower for a long time. There are no instructions for measuring out the stabilizer so I'm not sure if I will use it.But all-in-all this is a nice kit and for the price you can't go wrong."
1018,878,4,"This works for mice and at my house that's all I've ever seen.  Perhaps when I used to live out in the country this may have been nice to keep the big ones out of my kitchen.  It does work for mice, I baited it with peanut butter in a little plastic cap, but I did not like having to clean up after the mouse inside.  Mice can carry disease, in their feces, so I like to get them early, but I don't like cleaning up where they die with brushes or cloths.  I started buying those snap e mouse trapsKness SNAP E Mouse Control Re usuableway back in the early 90's.  People all ways talk about the better mouse trap, and I baited these in the round hole with those Andes mint chocolate bars. When I lived in the country, I put on in the wall just under a pipe to the water softener.  During the first cold snap, I could harvest 5 mice a day.  It was easy as the dual handle allowed a quick release without touching too, and they rarely got the bait before they died, the big plate would trigger the trap soon.This trap works fine, but unless I needed to catch a rat I'd prefer to keep using the little traps.  When I want them clean, I put them in a bucket of hot soapy water and spray them off, here, you need to remove batteries for safety, then clean the surface and wipe down the plates.  Too much trouble for a small kill.  I recommend to those who live on a farm or in an area infested with real rats.  It was not much use for me."
1204,307,5,"This trap has a very clever design that results in flipping one handle to set the trap.  The door close is fast, but gentle when tripped.  The size of the model that I got is stated to be correct for rabbits.  The size is 7"" X 7"" X 24"" and is great for cottontails and large squirrels.  Chipmunks don't weigh enough to trip it.  I haven't tried it on skunks yet, but the trap is a bit small for many on the skunks around here.  The trap also has a plate under the carrying handle so that the animal can't get at your hand.  Highly recommended."
0,648,5,"This has a very comfortable handle, does the job for which it is intended and is available at a reasonable price. I can't say that it makes weeding a pleasure but it does take some of the drudgery out of a necessary task. This is a worthwhile tool."
173,809,3,"People have been experimenting with castor oil as a mole and gopher repellent for some time. Some folks say it works, some say it doesn't. I can't tell yet.The castor oil in this product is contained in pellets. The manufacturer, Motomco, says to &#34;spread the granules on your lawn by hand or spreader. Water the granules into the soil for about 20 minutes to allow for the best penetration.&#34;  They also claim that since the ingredients are natural, the product is completely safe.But be cautious. Castor oil is fairly safe and is sometimes taken internally, but it can cause stomach discomfort, cramping, nausea, and faintness, according to WebMD, which also mentions that it is occasionally used to cause abortion. Probably you should not spread this by hand if you are pregnant.Another website (Washington State Fish and Wildlife) tells us that castor oil has been used in commercial preparations to repel moles with some success.  Supposedly the repellent &#34;coats earthworms and other prey with castor oil. This renders the prey distasteful and, if eaten, gives the moles diarrhea.&#34;  The article says that &#34;repellent may need to be reapplied before moles depart. Once moles move elsewhere, the solution usually remains effective for 30 to 60 days.&#34; It warns against using insecticides to get rid of moles, so the implied message is that the castor oil repellent is preferable.I should add a caution here. An old home remedy to repel moles involves castor beans. Do not attempt this unless you are familiar with the dangers of castor beans. Their shell (not the oil inside) contains ricin, a dangerous poison. So you are better off using this Tomcat product."
1355,703,4,"If you have any experience with potted plants, you know that the water needs to drain to keep the roots from rotting. For years we have use pebbles and pieces of broken pots in the bottom of a pot to filter the water so that most of the soil stays in the pot.This filter does a better job, it weighs less and is reusable from season to season."

424,433,5,"This is a sturdy and attractive feeder/water combo. The food/water cylinders are made from a plastic that feels pretty heavy duty. The metal parts are a burnished copperish color. You can either fill the cylinders with a seed and a water or 2 seeds/2 waters. I have multiple bird baths in my yard so I decided to put feed in both cylinders as opposed to a water cylinder. I hung it out in our courtyard this afternoon and already had evening grossbeaks and Bullock's oriels mobbing the feeder.I love the hanging mechanism which allows for hanging the feeder on a nail, hook, or small diameter branch. There is plenty of space on both feeders for the birds to comfortably sit and eat. It is fun to watch the birds sitting on two feeders so close together. There were eight or nine birds eating at any one time. The unit was very easy to open and fill. This is a lovely unit and a great addition to the 14 other feeders I already use in my yard!"
1299,237,4,"I've tried the sonic spikes, I've tried traps (which works somewhat, but kind of a pain), and I have used poison pellets.These seem to work well, but as mentioned elsewhere here (same for kill traps for that matter), you MUST find and use these on the main tunnel, or you might as well be throwing them away.  I think this is the most difficult part in controlling moles, because the main tunnel is not always obvious.I was able to find the long, straight run that my critters were using, inserted the worms, and after about a week, I noticed much less activity.  Will continue to use these throughout the summer if they continue to be so effective.Highly recommended."
683,627,5,"I had my doubts about this feeder...wasn't quite sure if the humming birds would get so close to a very busy window (I used the suction cups and put it on the window over my kitchen sink). It took a week, maybe ten days, and they made their way to this feeder! They didn't stay long for the first few visits, but after that, they seemed to feel really comfortable with all the movement in the kitchen and just sat and drank! We love it! As far as the feeder goes, it's not failed us yet in any way shape or form! We've had it up for about two months. It hasn't fallen once. I would think, as with other suction cups being exposed to the elements, you might have to remove the feeder (and cups) from the window, and clean them (along with the window) and then re-attach them. I love the cleaning ease of this feeder! Pop open the top and clean it out! I love that it doesn't have those fake little flower petal things that just get all gummed up; the holes are a perfect size to clean with a couple of quick swishes of an old toothbrush...and that doesn't have to be done every time.I love the fact that I can put my screen up and reach right outside to take it off to clean it and fill it! Easy peasy! I don't have a problem with ants (fortunately) so I can't really comment on the ant moat (I'm not using it). I am gradually phasing out all my older feeders (with the fake little yellow flower petals for feeding holes!) and have been replacing them with the Aspects feeders!"
1189,874,3,"Good idea.  Expensively achieved.  You'd do better with your own research, plot of land, and seeds.  That said if you're a working gardener and need a quick fix for a salad garden then this is right up your alley.  Everything you need in one package and all ready to go in the ground.  For some that might be really handy and if so then consider the convenience and price and if it's worth it I will attest to the fact that the package is complete and ready to go.  Just plant the pods and grow."

316,762,4,"I use pretty much everything to tie/clip up the plants in my garden from twist ties (too fussy) to twine (degrades over time, plus who wants to deal with knots?) to pieces of garden Velcro tape (fine, but not cost effective) to little tiny spring-loaded hairclips that orchid growers use to stake orchids (perfect, but not great for thick stems and the metal bits rust out over time). My favorite have become the little spring loaded clips because they are so easy to use- simply squeeze one end, and the other pops open. Very easy to shift up the length of a stem without much fuss and doesn't damage the plant. I decided to try these because they seemed like a similar product but designed specifically for gardening use.They work a little differently than the spring loaded clips (you put your fingers into loops, snap them closed or pull them apart to open) so they are *little* fussier, but they are much better than twist ties and twines because no tying is required. Once you get the hang of them, they are easy to use. They also DO blend in nicely with the plants - they look like little tendrils of leaves. I like that you can grab a handful and use them on either one plant that needs support and guidance (my 20+ foot passiflora vine needs constant clipping) or as needed throughout the garden (droopy tomato stalk? clip to the trellis and you are done.)I can't yet speak to durability, or if these will survive a season of Florida sun and high temps (things tend to degrade very quickly around here) but I'm excited to see how they do."
1342,38,3,"Dethatch your lawn with this rake ONLY if you really have to!! This tool is head heavy, so your arms will get really tired, unless you are in super shape. I will allot one week to do the front lawn. I am still sore from using it on 1/3 of the lawn. It will remove everything including green, which will leave your lawn looking terrible."
990,471,4,"The active ingredient Deltamethrin works well on odorous ants here in New Mexico. We use it outdoors near doors, patios, and on any visible ant mounds. Once this product has been applied the ants disappear. While it may be water-proof, NM rains wash it away and it must be reapplied."
620,266,4,Works well for my smaller front yard.  For a larger yard I would recommend a different method such as using a large rake with either another rake or a nice wide solid rake to use as a pusher.
465,48,5,I was certain this product would leak but I have had it hooked up to water under pressure for  some time now and have not noticed a single drip. I will add more to other quick connect purposes.
1514,699,4,"The product is a bait station that is already loaded with bait. The upside of that is you don't have to touch the bait. Tomcat also sells bait stations that have to be filled. The stations are small so they are suited to small house mice. The station itself is a plastic container that is sectioned off with the bait to one side and a small hallway of sorts on the other. It is child and pet proof because only a small mice would be small enough to get into hallway to get to the bait.We normally prefer to use traps because we don't like using poisons. Main reason we don't like poisons is that the mouse runs off and dies in wall somewhere and now you have to go find the dead mouse when you smell his stink.In one application that we have, these work perfect. We keep these in our garage. We've had mice in there but we also have pets occasionally run in there. We don't want to risk our pets eating an open tray of bait pellets. We set regular traps out but we don't have regular mice activity there so the bait tends to dry out and become useless. These ready-to-use, safer pre-filled bait stations that work just great for the garage."
1001,553,3,"When reviewing something like this spray, it's pretty much impossible to tell how well it's working unless you treat half your yard and leave the other half untreated...it's not statistically valid, but at least you can tell if it's made a difference.  I didn't do that, so this review is based upon a few observations and some common sense.1. It appeared to reduce the aphid population in my basal plants.2. The black what-ever-the-heck-they-are bugs on the chives were pretty much gone the day after I sprayed them.3. The aphids, scale, whitefly and other crud that lives on my lemon tree seemed to be pretty much unaffected.  The only thing I think will really help that poor tree is a chainsaw.  And a bonfire.4. My roses still developed black spot, but I think it was better than previous years.Will I buy more next year?  Probably.  I'm not much into using chemicals of any kind, but this is (theoretically, at least!) safer than most.  I'll still mostly use the old standby...a garden hose with a hard spray.  It may not kill the bugs, but at least they'll wake up in the neighbor's yard."
22,724,2,"This was my original review:All of my ladybugs were alive when I received them!  They were beautiful.  I bought them because I am having a problem with white flies in my lawn, and other aphids on some of my plants.They arrived quickly.  They were packaged well with a refrigerate pack to make sure that did not get too hot.  They came with a sheet of wonderful instructions.  They also came with a small pack of nectar to sprinkle out with them to help keep them nearby.  But, I also ordered the larger bag of it when I order these.I was very happy with this transaction.THIS IS MY ADDITIONAL REVIEW:These lady bugs are Asian lady bugs.  They are not native.  They do bite when their food source gets low; as in late in the year.  They become aggressive.  I had several bites.  I could not believe it!  Then, I did some research on line and found out.  Asian ladybugs also eat the larvae of native ladybugs. You are much much better off getting lacewings.  I bought those too, and they worked great!  And they will not bite you or kill beneficial insects."
1120,47,5,"With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe, progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe. After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17&#34; piece and an 11&#34; log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations. This axe does and for me is well worth the money."
177,432,5,I just got this and have not had much springtime gophr activity yet to test it on but it seems very well made.  I ordered it because it does not take batteris which is a great improvement over my last product of this type and it goes in the ground so far that you can  mow right over it instead of mowing it off.  I had alot of moles in my garden lt year and am looking forward to see how thi product works on them.  I have tried sevral other solutions and they haven't worked.  I was down to this or traps which are a pain.  Hoping this works well.Will update during the growing season.

588,875,5,"I love this grill brush...it makes my last grill brush look like a toy!The brush is very light, but tough as can be. After I cook, while the grill is still hot, I used this brush to clean...I could not believe how much came off and how quickly. It also got into places I could not get into with my old grill brush.m cleaning was a snap, but be careful as these bristles are sharp.Whenever I fire up my grill, and I always re brush it before I cook, just to be sure everything was off the grill. This time when I did that, there was nothing to clean, as I got it all off the night before after cooking! That was a first.This really is a great tool that I will be using all summer!"
910,292,5,Best bargain for the money and I feed hundreds of finches during the winter and have problems finding it in the stores as winter progresses
245,410,5,"So far... I have used this for a year now, & it holds very durable. I know it's probably too early yet but there is no kinks yet & I have this stored on ground ( not rolled up ). So it has been in bad weather elements... I recommend so far."
107,869,4,"This has many great attributes:  it isn't bad looking, not really that big and tall, black rather than some hideous col0r, lightweight so it's easy to move and of course, best of all you don't have to plug it in or hook it up to a hose.  The only thing is where I want to put it to protect a couple of apple trees I'm trying to espalier against a fence is a place I often walk myself and I then can get sprayed instead of the deer. It does seem to discourage the deer but I need it in many places.  I will try moving it around, easy to do as it's so light, and see how long the effects last from the last time the deer were sprayed.  I guess you could just move it every week or so so the deer would be taken by surprise because there are many different areas in my garden where they like to nibble."
781,572,5,"This is a good nozzle for sure, but not quite as well-engineered as other Gardena tools I have owned. The quick connect works well, but the spray adjustment mechanism is a bit balky and takes two hands to adjust properly. This one is made from Germany's finest plastic. For ease of adjustment, I would recommend one of the better brass models out there. But since this not terribly expensive and appears to be durable, I can still recommend it for general garden use."
12,856,5,"I have all cordless Black & Decker tools and when I received this one, I was excited.  First things first, if you used a gas blower and are now switching to cordless electric, you'll find electric has its limitations.  The electric cordless does the job, but will most likely disappoint compared with gas versions in terms of power.  However I chose electric for most garden tools for its convienence.This blower does the job and can remove large piles of dry leaves.  I also used it to blow off dust from a cabinet I was refinishing in the driveway and it worked great.  The variable speed is a plus, and good for when you don't want too much dust flying around. The low speed setting ( 1 up to 6) reminds me of my NiCad blower when the batteries were near dead.The fast charger is a nice bonus and can fully charge a battery in a few hours.  The battery itself has a status light, and you can push a button to see how much juice you still have.  That is a really nice feature they added.The blower is light weight, and comes in a very small box.  Assembly is a snap litterally, and requires no tools.  You just connect the two black tubes together and snap it to the motor.The batteries are not interchangeable with the 18 volt NiCad versions.  Compared to the 18 volt NiCad version, I didn't notice any major difference in blowing power.  I do notice a slight delay in starting up with the lithium version compared to the NiCad though.  The delay is like a split second, nothing major.  This is also a lot thinner compared to the older version.All in all, this is a great addition to the B&D; cordless family.  You can't go wrong with this if you are looking for a cordless blower.  I highly recommend it."
653,647,5,"The main thing I like about this hose is that it is extremely light and seems to be holding up. If it gives me any problems, I will update this review."
738,905,4,This big orange plastic foot can be attached to a rake or broom handle. It works well in tamping down leaves in those big but awkward recycling bags. It also does an admirable job with papers and trash. A fringe benefit is that it attracts kids who think it is great fun to use. It is sturdier than I expected and would be great for using with lawn clippings as well as leaves. I do think the list price is a bit high and the packaging was a beast to undo. Still a fun way to squeeze in every last bit. Recommended.

347,573,5,"Lets be clear.  This cover fits perfectly, even has a bump built in to cover the handle.  The cover is a thin material, however it is a very durable, heavy duty material.  The seams are well made.  While I have only had this cover for a few weeks, I fully expect to last many years."
519,909,3,"This is a case where you need to think what your goal is.Are you looking to dump huge amounts of yard waste into this to shred? Skip this and look at a chipper instead. This needs dry leaves slowly fed into it for it to shred them properly. It can not handle any wet leaves (and when are leaves totally dry?) nor can it handle sticks/branches of any kind.If you are looking at reducing the amount of yard waste you place at the curb, you might instead consider a vacuum/blower that shreds leaves as it goes. The power of suction will normally create a better end result and they can handle items other than dry leaves slightly better.Now if you have a composting bin/box and are looking for something to allow you to shred leaves finely for that and can take the time to sort your leaves to select dry ones without sticks, then this device will work for you. But honestly you are the exception and I am guessing that most people think they can dump leaves randomly into this and not overload it...that just isn't the case.If this had metal teeth that could handle sticks and was designed to limit the intake better so it could handle dumping large amounts in, then it would be a 5 star product--even at the higher price required. But this is sort of like a plastic toy for chopping dry leaves that you have had to hand sort.I hope this review has helped you!"
1270,375,5,"I had one of these on my beloved Genesis Silver B. When I gave the grill a new home to upgrade to aGenesis S-320, I ordered this the same day.If you're grilling after dark, this light is just flat out awesome. It's just bright enough to cover your grilling area, without attracting every bug in the neighborhood. And because the lights are LED's with a gravity switch, you're never burning through batteries. In fact, I never used the power switch on my old one, and the three AAA batteries kept the thing going strong for at least a year.Seriously, once you use one of these, you will never, ever go back."
334,707,5,Never had a pressure washer before but I knew you needed one at least this PSI to make it worth your effort.  We just paid over 250.00 to have our driveway cleaned by professionals and decided we would keep it clean in the future ourselves.  Had no problems setting up or using.  So it starts right up on first or second pull.  I have alot of other plans to use it and feel it is well worth the money.
1300,167,4,"I was interested in trying this product to keep the deer away from the hostas in my yard.  In reading and re-reading the product description here at Amazon, I couldn't find out what was in it.  I'm allergic to capsaicin (chili peppers), and I've had allergic reactions to animal repellents in the past, so I needed to know if this product has any capsaicin. Fortunately, the product description includes a toll free number to call for more information.  The customer service representative on the other end of the line was extremely helpful.  She told me Deer Off contains not only capsaicin, but also egg solids and garlic.  So if you're allergic to eggs, capsaicin, or garlic, you shouldn't use this product.  She suggested I try another Havahart product, Defense, instead, which has eggs, but no capsaicin.So, while I didn't get to try Deer Off because of my allergies, I found Havahart Customer Service quite polite as well as informative and helpful.  But since this product contains food ingredients, the foods should be listed here on the product description page so that people with food allergies can easily tell what's in it before ordering it.  In general, if you have food allergies, especially to eggs or spices, always check the ingredients of animal repellents before using them in your yard."
183,356,4,"Like anything else that cleans, you usually have to use a little elbow grease to make these cleaners work.  If you leave this product on for a few minutes and then brush grill with a steel brush, most (not all) of the junk comes off.  A second coating usually will do the trick unless it is super gross black oil/charcoal stuff baked on.  At least you don't inhale all kinds of naseous fumes like some products."
545,756,4,"I was actually quite impressed with this mower. I will admit this is the first mower of this type that I have ever tried to use, but that didn't put me off at all. There is some assembly required, roughly about 15 minutes and can be done by one person. I've had more trouble putting Lego sets together than I did this mower. :-)The first thing that I would tell someone is if you have a middle to large sized yard this is NOT the type of mower you want, unless you want to lose weight and stay fit - than it may be your thing. For smaller sized yards this is perfect. Maneuvering can be a tad tricky, but not much more than any other mower. Adjustable height to cut the grass is a plus as well.I found it rather easy to push, it has a nice gliding feel to it and with out a motor on it you don't get all that normal vibration. While using it I actually had one person drive by and stop and ask about it. Never had that happen before with my normal loud mower.If you have a smaller-ish yard, and are looking to save money on gas and what not this is certainly a green mower that you should consider. I quite like it."
976,169,3,"This shovel most definitely makes it easier to shovel snow.  Its bent handle saves you the effort of bending over so much which is a blessing to many like myself I am sure.  I have used it in the aftermath of a couple of storms here in New England and my back felt much better when it was all said and done... That being said, this shovel is not flawless.  It works much better on lighter snow since when its a heavy amount the handle bends too much requiring a little extra effort tossing the load.  Multiply that times many scoops and you will realize that the bending handle comes to bring its own sort of pain.  Not as bad as bending over with a regular shovel, but still as aggravating in its own way.  Also, although this shovel has an ice scraper edge on it, it is not very good at scraping the surface.  The shape of the handle makes it necessary to bend the shovel more awkwardly forward, almost vertically for scraping and its not as easy to accomplish as you would guess, or comfortable.  I keep another straight handle shovel handy just to scrape the last inch or so off any surface...In conclusion, although this shovel is much easier on the back than a cheaper straight barreled one, I would suggest this not be the only shovel in your winter arsenal.  An old fashioned straight edge is still needed for really heavy snow in my opinion, and for scraping ice and sticky parts on the driveway.  Overall however its a well made shovel that may be a little more expensive than you are used too, but worth it for your average snowfall amounts...: )"
554,736,5,Set this up in my basement inside a mechanic's &#34;trouble&#34; fixture. Hung it above several containers of dirt. Put aluminum foil around the side and over the top. Haven't set the seeds yet but I have great expectations.
1632,132,5,"It comes with a nice long cord which was long enough to reach from the corner of the room of my RV down the refrigerator vent where I connected it to my 7 am charge controller and ran a wire underneath to the battery.  This cord has a plug on the end to connect to one of several connectors included. (No wire splicing necessary).  It comes with connectors for connecting to a cigarette lighter, alligator clips for connecting directly to battery posts, as well as a connector that just splits off two wires with the insulation already removed for you in case you need to wire them directly into something, or extend them with more wire.  It also includes a LED test light that can plug directly into the solar panels cord to test whether the panel is working.I have attached two of these solar panels to the roof of my RV camper.  They keep the battery fully charged even with the propane detector still using electricity.  I was able to screw the panel directly into my rubber roof with the screws provided with no problem.  They are very secure and they were a great investment."
384,589,5,"We don't have a small yard, we have a full 1/3 acre. When we first moved in we needed a reliable way to cut the lawn and purchased this with theUS Wire 74100 12/3 100-Feet SJTW Yellow Heavy-Duty Lighted Extension Cordto reach all of the corners of our yard. I had used other mowers before (battery operated) and was pleasantly surprised at how easily this cut through our yard.Because this is 12 amp, make sure you get a cord that is able to support it or you will have difficulties with the motor lasting.My husband was NOT enamored with this - was concerned about the cord, somehow he couldn't figure it out. However, I loved it - it didn't seem difficult to me to think before I had my turn on the mower.With 1/3 acre, we are not using this as our only resource now, he has a riding mower - but we still use this for the small areas of our yard where that doesn't fit, or for up and down hills where it isn't safe to go.We use it on the mulching setting, and have been constantly pleased since we purchased it over a year ago. It was easy to assemble and easy to store over the winter. Recommended."
1259,936,5,"You NEED fine potting soil for starting seeds. I remember using some kind of chunks-and-twigs garden amendment I had on hand one spring and being baffled at the low rate of germination I was seeing. Then I realized that I needed proper seed starting mix like this, and it made a huge difference. 100% recommended. You don't want to be without this if you start your flowers and vegetables from seeds, makes all the difference in the world!"
96,917,4,"The Parrot Flower Power - Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Bluetooth Smart Plant Sensor works really well although there is some room for improvement in the app.Once the app finds your device which is easy and you identify the plant of the huge database you will get alerts on water, fertilizer,, temperature, and sunlight needs. Unfortunately the app doesn't help track how much you add each time and calculate future needs based on those results. Also the app does not track anything as to the size or age of the plant so it isn't fine tuned to help with starting seedlings.I have moved the device around to several plants and it is easy to update to the new plant. However you won't get advice until it has been with the plant for 24 hours. Understandable for temperature and sunlight but I would like to be able to get water and fertilizer recommendations more immediately.Even before the 24 hours and the automated alerts/todo list the app generates you can always monitor live and see the results of adding water, changing temp, or sunlight exposure. The results are immediate but there is no indication as to the target recommended.This is a very cool device and every plant I have used it on has benefited greatly by the recommended actions. However at this price it would be tough to justify very many of these. I look forward to app improvements and I hope they optimize for iPad as it is only available in the iphone app store right now which doesn't make vest use of the larger iPad screen."
232,759,3,"I've been using a battery-powered trimmer for the past two years, and it's worked like a dream until I tried handling the side yard, which had had lots of rain and sun and therefore produced tenacious mega-weeds before I could get out there.  It proved too much for my battery-powered trimmer, so I switched to this one.  Honestly, it didn't perform much better.Assembly was quick and painless, which is a huge pro in my book.  Having used the battery-powered option for so long, I got a little stuck on the mixing of gas and oil.  If you're used to gas-powered trimmers, that won't be an issue, but if you're like me and going from a battery-powered option, mixing the gas and oil each time can be frustrating.My main complaint has been with the overheating and stalling.  This happened four times in 15 minutes while I was working in that jungle we call a side yard.  I figured I was over-taxing it and moved to the grass.  It still stalled.  I let it cool completely, came back two hours later and re-tried it, and within ten minutes it stalled again.  At that point, I was frustrated and just put it away for the night.Performance-wise, it's OK.  It's done a decent job on grass and as mentioned above struggled with the jungle weeds (can't fault it too much for that, but if you're looking for a heavy-duty trimmer this is not your best bet).  This would not be my first choice due to the stalling for a household trimmer."
594,96,5,"This is one of many products in our arsenal to keep the nasty biters in control.  We reapply every couple of weeks or after a typical TX. downpour into drains, wet areas in our yard.  Even when we run the sprinkler system, it's still lasts a couple of weeks-and you don't need to use alot. It works really well."
1671,158,1,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
488,62,5,"This Weber Rotisserie is the best grilling item that I have bought so far. I did two Cornish Hens and they were so moist and juicy, I couldn't wait to try a roasting Chicken. Well, I finally tried one, and oh, my God!!!! It was AWESOME!!! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten!! I cooked it slow, about 3 hours, starting with about 12 coals on each side, using the indirect cooking method. I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same (about 325-350). I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals. I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time. To die for!!!  I also tried a Pork roast. The same awesome results were obtained. Next I will try a Turkey. I am totally sold on this item, and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2"" kettle grill. You won't be disappointed!!"
1254,421,5,"One thing many homeowners neglect is their poor lawnmower.  Ever since I was a boy my father taught me to change the oil every year, sharpen the blade, and replace the air filter.  I have refined his frugal spirit by cleaning my air filter on odd years and replacing it on even years.That is a small amount of work and expense and it ensures your lawnmower will easily cut through your grass, and reliably, basically forever.  I've never seen a lawnmower fail unless it had been neglected.This was a perfect fit and I received the OEM part in easy to open packaging.  The value was much better than at local retailers."
497,42,2,I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas. I tried it out but decided to return it. Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer (18 volt) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do. I wanted it to work for me but no way!
1164,145,5,"First of all, this feeder does not come with a hook, so if you plan to hang it in a tree, like I did, you'll need to order a metal extension hook unless you plan to mess with rope. I really like the hook I bought: Panacea 89017 Tree Branch Hook, Black, 36-Inch. The hook is almost the same length as the feeder, so they ship together nicely in the same Amazon box if you order them together. Within 48 hours of installing the feeder, I caught my 3 resident squirrels sliding down the hook from the tree onto the feeder and attempting to chew the seed holes on the feeder to access the seed. However, it was pure entertainment for me because 90% of the time the squirrels cannot maintain their balance on the tiny feeder roof and simply slip off 4' to the cushioned ground below (below pine tree, so lots of soft dry needles). In snow, they simply cannot hang on and slip right off. For a week the squirrels attempted to jump at the feeder or climb down the hook, and they finally seem to have given up and now simply feed off the fallen seed on the ground. I am delighted that so many bird species are using the feeding in the first 2 weeks: cardinals, house finches, mourning doves (feed on seed on ground), woodpecker, titmouse, nut hatch, chickadee, etc. Recently, it poured and hailed/sleeted at all angles, so I decided to buy a large, clear plastic baffle to provide added coverage from the weather: Aspects 182 Super Dome. It was a steep $40 (other reviews suggested a $8-10 one sold at most feed supply stores), but I wish I had bought it from day 1 because it would have kept the squirrels off the feeder completely. I like that it is clear and reviews said it lasts over time (it is also made in the USA). I did examine the feeder after 3 weeks of use now and the squirrels managed to scratch and chew the feeder in certain spots, which can be completely eliminated by buying the aforementioned baffle. The squirrels now have no way to surpass the baffle. You could obviously probably buy any feeder and use the baffle to prevent squirrel access...We have a lot of cardinals in our area, so I attached the cardinal ring from day 1 and extended all of the metal perches directly into the ring by twisting them at even intervals so that they full screw into every hole of the 'ring'. Another review mentioned birds getting stuck if you don't extend the perches fully into the ring. I find that the cardinals love the feeder, but they also like to just feed off the fallen seed 50% of the time, as they appear to prefer ground feeding for ease of watching for predators...The ring just gives the feeder a 360 degree perch, so most of the birds hop around the ring and explore the seed in each door. If they see me at the window and are shy, they also hop to a door of the feeder where they are more hidden.As for seed, I bought (on Amazon) the Kaytee Cardinal Blend, 7-Pound Bag and Kaytee Waste Free Nut and Fruit Blend, 5.5-Pound Bag. I created a large paper funnel with poster board I have, and scooped in 1 cup of one bag and 1 cup of the other bag to have even intervals of different seed. Even the chickadees and smaller birds love the larger nuts and seeds (I don't use any millet). They fly to the feeder and quickly grab 1 sunflower seed, then fly to a nearby pine street branch and peck away at it to break it open. Kaytee seemed to be one of the only seed brands that didn't have complaints from consumers about twigs and other waste. I do find it to be 100% seed. I also occasionally mix in some of my organic breakfast cereal, such as granola with chia seeds, which they love as something different.My final thought is that given how quickly the squirrels tried to get to the feeder and seed, I can't imagine using any other feeder.  The seed would surely be dumped in 1-2 days unless it were hung in a location where squirrels have no access. You really must buy this feeder if you plan to use the feeder in an area where you have squirrels. Other reviews stated that raccoons and deer can feed easily, so if you live in those areas, you might consider hanging it higher...If you're on a budget and can't afford this feeder, at least buy the baffle I recommend, which seems to be curved enough to prevent any squirrel from reaching any feeder you use below it.All in all, I spent almost $200 on the feeder, hook, clear baffle/dome, and quality nut/fruit/sunflower seed, but it was like a Disney movie today with over 15 birds and squirrels in my yard at the same time happily feeding at the feeder and on the ground.Other fun accessories to build your backyard avian habitat (see my other reviews):-->ceramic pedestal bird bath-->wood blue bird houseUPDATE: Have had the feeder for about 3 months and have many regular birds (many mated pairs) that come daily at regular intervals:1 cardinal pair1 chickadee pair1 titmouse pair1 gold finch pair3-4 mourning dove pairs (that feed below it and then sun themselves nearby)1 territorial catbird pair (they chase away all other small birds when feeding)6 regular house sparrows and their chicks2-4 song sparrows2-4 red-headed house finches that travel together1 agile-flying nuthatcher (swoops in, grabs a nut, flies off)1-2 grackles with a voracious appetite4 different woodpecker species (Northern Flicker, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker)1 occasional ground-feeding cowbird pair (male with brown head)1 shy house wren pair (they mostly look for insects in the vicinity, and only occasionally use the feeder)1 inquisitive blue jay (doesn't feed from feeder, but watches it, and feeds off ground nearby)3-5 squirrels that feed on the groundThey all recognize me when I glance out the window and throw them fruit and large nut pieces...Also, the catbirds and grackles are VERY smart. They realized that if they both use the perch, the seed hatches are closed, so they only feed 1 at a time and get impatient while 1 feeds and the other waits nearby! I have so many birds frequenting the feeder that the feed level drops 1-2 inches per day. I did adjust the tension level of the perch to have it close with less weight, but it was sad to see the birds fighting so much because when 3 sparrows or finches landed, the doors closed and they got aggressive. I also saw the heavier woodpecker really stressing over trying to pry a nut out with the doors 95% closed...I decided to just recalibrate it and allow full access for all birds...it just means some will gorge and I'll go through more seed....I find that some species tend to wildly peck at the seed to get to their favorite morsels, so the happy mourning doves wait below for the shower of seed that falls..."
692,756,5,"This model is not much more different than myFiskars 6201 18-Inch StaySharp Max Push Reel Lawn Mowerthat I bought a year ago and have been very happy with.  Even my neighbors love to borrow my 6201!The build and cutting quality doesn't even compare to the Scotts brand that you'll often find in the big home improvement discount stores.  If you've never tried a reel mower before, you'll be pleasantly surprised when you push a mower like this model and the grass comes flying out just like a gas or electric mower... but without all the hassle.This model shares many of the same qualities as my 6201 model.  It is relatively light and easy to maneuver, has great cutting performance, and a nice, high-quality feel to it.  The only differences that I detect between this and the 6201 is that this model has lighter, plastic wheels that contributes to an overall lighter feel.  It also is slightly narrower than the 6201, and doesn't cut quite as close to edges as the 6201.Other than those differences, I don't notice any differences in cutting performance.  Both work great on grass and many weeds.  You'll find yourself needing to cut more often with reel mowers because if the grass gets too long, it becomes difficult to push.  But you'll WANT to mow more often because of how easy and fun it is to get a little exercise and mow your lawn the eco-friendly way.  It's a great lawnmower."
1441,279,5,This is the only shutoff valve I will buy for my hoses from now on. Dramm has the absolute best quality water control valves on the market. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a hose. If i could give it 6 stars I would. This and a Gilmour 528T twist brass water nozzle is the best set up in my opinion.
443,761,2,"I have a mole problem and have been using the oldVictor 0645 Mole Trap Plunger Styleall metal traps, same as the ""critter getter"" service uses in my area.  They work OK, are a little hard to set up and fairly sensitive.I tried this Sweeney plastic one in 3 different places. First, it is easy to set . . . BUT it isn't very sensitive.  One place I set it the mole came back through and pushed soil up around the plate.  If it had gone off, there would have been one less mole.  The second place was at a breathing hole where I had stepped on it and the mole had thrown up a new pile.  With the Victor, I would have had a sure kill.  With the Sweeney, it didn't go off although I could tell that something had pushed more dirt out.I guess if I had moles that worked out with weights and were very buff the Sweeney would have tripped.  I could make it go off with a screwdriver, so it actually was working.  I set my Victor traps out the next day in the same places and got a mole.  Bought those at least 10 years ago and they still work."

1598,11,5,"At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces."

1189,729,5,"The house is clean and sparkling so when they sent this I thought, 'Oh great, what will I do with it?'  Well a friend of mine in Texas is familiar with this product and was stopping by last weekend and wanted to know all about my Vine membership with Amazon...and of course if could I get him on ( and for all the Vine members out there that here this week in week out...the answer is no btw...it's invitation only as far as I know)...but I was showing him some recent Vine products I was trying out currently and the Krud Kutter was among them and I explained the situation since I had just had the House professionally cleaned, and Bill, that's his name, said, 'Well heck, little buddy (don't ask), this makes a preemo driveway cleaner back home and you should try it'.  Well he and Agnes drove away Sunday which just happened to be a sunny dry day and I thought why not!!  So sure nuff I mixed some up (guessing at this point but got lucky) and darned if it didn't clean that driveway with just two applications.  So...I can 't speak to the house cleaning part other than to say if it could cut the grime on the driveway with a couple of sprays then I'm assuming it'll do a bang up job on the house siding."
136,591,5,"The good the bad and the ugly:Although the metal deck and electric motor are stoutly built the mounting of the 3 batteries and the ""hood"" is not so good. My mower arrived with the two ty-wraps that are supposed to hold the batteries down snapped with the result that the batteries moved and broke the hood and the part where the key and charger plugin mount. Obviously they did not take shipping into account when designing this unit (shipping is typically the most brutal treatment a device will experience in it's lifetime). Anyway, plenty of epoxy (super glue won't work on the kind of plastic they use) and some more ty-wraps and it was ready to be tested.Here is where I was surprised. It did a great job! The batteries had enough juice to mow the whole yard (about 15 minutes) and seemed to be running strong when I was finished. It is quieter than a gas mower but still makes plenty of noise so you know it is running.The Good:- Basically the same metal deck and blade a gasoline mower of the same size would use.- The 3 motorcycle type sealed batteries have plenty of capacity for small yards- No extension cords to deal with since it is battery powered.- Nice looking unitThe Bad:- Well, it is not designed to be shipped so you may end up having to send a few back for replacement or have a local Toro repair shop replace the broken parts under warranty.- There is no place to store the key when the mower is not in use. IMPORTANT: Do not leave the key in when not using the mower. It would be way too easy for an unsuspecting child (or even adult) to turn the thing on and do some serious injury. (Advantage of electric: Instant On. Disadvantage of electric: Instant On)- There is no indication of how much power there is left in the batteries so you may just run out of juice part way through mowing. Probably not a huge issue for small yards if you charge after every use.- It struggles with very deep cuts. You are not supposed to cut more than 1/3 of the height of the lawn at a mowing so as long as you keep up with the mowing, this should work fine. If you tend to let things go until the mountain lions start hiding out in your front yard, you best stick with a big, powerful gasoline model.The Ugly- Nothing really. It is a good looking mower and quiet enough for the neighbors to be happy."
713,824,5,Weber is the best got it here yesturday put it together in 10 min and was smokin ribs 25 min later. This is a very efficient grill so I ended up slightly over cooking them but they still came out good. Anyway the grill is sturdy easy to use and easy to keep clean. After I ordered it I continued reading reviews and I was worried because I read in someone's review that it was not made here but to my relief its made in the good old USA if it wasn't it was going back. I got the chimney starter and the cover and they are made in china or taiwan but the grill is made here.
1589,63,3,"If you're a lightweight and looking for something to scoot you along, then this is for you; however, if you're a little on the heavy side even the slightest, the wheels on this hesitate to move smoothly.  The reason is these do not have wheels that are totally rounded on the inside as well as the outside.  Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside.  Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot.  The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon.  On this you cannot.  So, as I said, if all you want is something to scoot on and you're a skinny-mini type of person, then this will do well for you.  Otherwise, try your local garden center."
358,446,4,"Miracle-Gro is our fertilizer of choice for our flowers and veggies.  The LiquaFeed refills are much more expensive compared to buying the powder and mixing with water, but we use this for small areas that don't require gallons of mix.  It is truly convenient, but truly too expensive for broad gardening needs.Recommended if you don't mind paying more than double the cost of regular Miracle-Gro."
1357,43,2,"I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands."
1288,886,5,"Though not designed for a large smoker with a tall smoke stack, we decided to try using this x-large grill cover for just that purpose; so far, so good. The generous size covers the full length & width of the smoker and nearly the entire height, leaving only the bottom of the legs exposed. Because the grill cover was designed for a normally shaped grill, we knew there would be sections that didn't fit snugly and expected to have to use bungee cords to secure the bottom of the cover. To our surprise, the straps sewn into the bottom of the cover pull tightly enough to keep it in place. We have strong south winds, routinely gusting more than 35 mph for extended periods of time and so far, we've only had to adjust the cover & retighten the straps once. And even though it had loosened, the cover did not blow off.So far, the only element that has blasted the cover is wind; though we have had rain, it hasn't been prolonged and no hail, ice, snow yet. Given the quality construction of this cover, I am feeling pretty positive that it will hold up to the worst mother nature throws its way. Will update later if I am proven wrong."
1482,756,5,"Last night, my new Fiskars 17 inch arrived.  I put it together in about 7 minutes, with ease.  This morning, I mowed the lawn.  It was actually fun.This is a ""reel"" mower, powered by pushing, what we in the Midwest call a ""push"" mower.  But this is designed brilliantly, to be tough, durable, yet light and fun to use.  Fiskars has taken the reel mower to a new standard.About ten years ago, I switched to reel mowers.  I wanted to preserve hearing, and to enjoy the exercise of cutting a lawn.  The problem with three models I have used over the years is that they clog on the smallest stick, or on clumps of grass, and the handles bend, or the bolts holding the handles warp, and the mower is both frustrating to use, and lasts barely a season.This is my second Fiskars, and the first still works fine.  Both the 18 inch and this 17 inch model are sturdy, and the blades cut through small sticks and clumps, rarely clogging.  They are easy to maneuver, and the handles fit to the frame without bolts to warp.  Yes, they make a nice noise, and are just fun to cut with...Some complain that the cuts are uneven, and this is true on most reel mowers.  With the Fiskars, the cut is more even, although from time to time you do get a slightly shaggy cut over hills.I would never go back to a power mower.  I would never go back to the german model reel mower, or the other brands I have used.  I greatly admire a product that combines excellent design with solid manufacture, and that is workable for the buyer.  I want to cut my lawn again.  This should get 6 stars."

1329,673,5,"When after about 18 months both batteries for my Black and Decker NST2018 string trimmer ran down and died, I decided that the convenience of a cordless trimmer wasn't worth the expense, as a couple of new batteries would cost almost as much as a brand new NST2018 trimmer.  I decided to go back to a corded electric trimmer, and the Black and Decker GH710 Grasshog looked like a good one.  The cool cutaway shot of the gear drive seemed to indicate that the trimmer would have a lot of torque.  Some of the other key features of interest were the 14"" cutting diameter, dual cutting strings, a powerful 6 amp motor, and the adjustable length handle.  It seemed like a good deal at fifty bucks with free shipping, so I pulled the trigger.The Grasshog is smaller than I expected, which is good, because it requires less space to store.  The 14"" diameter provides a nice area of coverage.  With the powerful 6 amp motor driving the two trimming lines, the Grasshog is quite an impressive performer.  The motor does deliver a lot of torque, and if you are not careful, you can easily whack of all the grass, and just have dirt left.  The Grasshog can easily handle most lawns of moderate height and thickness.When your trimmer lines are at the proper length, you can definitely do some heavy duty damage with this baby.  Maintaining proper string length, is a key factor for every string trimmer.  Fortunately Black and Decker's auto feed system for the dual string lines is pretty reliable, being effective perhaps 75 to 80 percent of the time.  That's pretty good, but perhaps with use the system may not work as well.  Tapping the reel on the ground for more cord, isn't necessary.Another plus is the light weight, and you can also easily adjust the length of the handle to minimize the strain on your back.  The carrying handle in the front pivots as well.  The cutting head can quickly be rotated for edging.  The grass shield is not shaped symmetrically, and it's not very deep.  It's apparently designed to spread the cut grass in some designated pattern, but I don't notice anything special about the way the cut grass is directed.  The power switch operates with just a simple squeeze, and the cord management system keeps the cord out of the way.The motor may be a little louder than other trimmers,  and it is sometimes too powerful for trimming that requires a little finesse.  Dealing with an extension cord can be a little inconvenient at times, but other than that, there aren't too many negatives about using the Grasshog.  This is my first experience with a dual string trimmer, and the results are much better than a single string.  Learning how to correctly wind the trimming cord on the dual spool may take a little practice though.  It's early, but so far I'm very impressed with the power and performance of the Grasshog.  It really lives up to its name!  Cleaning and maintenance is pretty easy.  Unless something radical occurs to change my mind, this was an excellent buy."

1532,588,5,"I have a slate slab patio and it was getting a little green in the corners and on the stairs.  The outdoor rugs I love to use had left marks on the patio as well.  The slate countertops around my BBQ had some grease stains.  I used the power washer with great success!  I had way too much fun cleaning, which is a positive.  It worked wonderfully and was very simple.  The nozzle can easily be adjusted as you are cleaning to be a needle point or a fan and clean with great force or more gentle spray.  I was able to clean the BBQ and fire pit covers and the slate counter.  I used a hand brush to apply some dish soap to the greasy marks and then power washed it all away.  I'd highly recommend this washer!"
144,874,3,"The idea is cool, but...it is a lot of packaging for a micro garden.And this IS a micro garden, and not a particularly well chosen one.  The size is only appropriate for someone planting a single raised bed/flower bed or a pot-based garden for their deck or balcony.  With that said, it really would only serve to raise enough for a salad now and again.  I think the idea would be more attractive in a ""salsa"" or herbs alone collection rather than this salad version."
1536,850,2,"This doesn't come in it's own box and it wasn't packed well.  The clear guard was split in half and the perch base mangled.  The base is very thin metal, so I wasn't surprised, luckily I was able to bend it back into shape with my hands.  The means of squirrel deterrence is the base being spring-loaded so the weight of the squirrel pulls the neck over the feeding holes.  This is hindered by the thin base getting bent out of shape and by smarter squirrels simply holding on to the midsection and feeding upside-down (they could reach around the clear guard after I glued it back together).For this method of squirrel proofing, I prefer the feeders that have the entire exterior spring-loaded, so that no matter where the squirrel grabs on, the hatches close.  The same company even makes that style and sells it for cheaper."
282,796,5,"Have a Perky-Pet 8 oz hummingbird feeder and love it because its easy to clean. What I LOVE about this one that Perky-Pet also makes is because it holds 24 Ounces of sugar water which means I only need to fill it every 3 days instead of once every day or day and a half.Also easy to fill and clean.  Love glass hummingbird feeders because they don't get cloudy like plastic can do.Get two of these because I swear hummingbirds tell all their friends 'hey guys she has free food for us'.  I thought I had two hummingbirds,but saw over a weeks time I had dozens.May 31 2013Have been watching the hummingbirds at the three feeders I have and this one really is loved by the hummingbirds, because of the wire ledge they can sit on and feed. Unlike another feeder that they have to stay in flight when feeding.  It's nice to have a variety of feeders so the birds get the one they like best.  Am reading up on hummingbirds, because I was curious if older hummingbirds are the ones using this specific feeder with the resting ledge."
1291,509,4,"This hose winder is very compact and easy to install.  When you switch the lever to wind mode, it does use the water pressure to self-wind the hose.  The water that ""leaks"" out of its discharge hose is actually the water that is needed to wind it.  I simply let that small hose drain into the plants, so it's not an issue.The problem, as some people have mentioned here, is the winding track doesn't always line up the way it's supposed to, so you have to guide it along in the ""box"" as it's winding.  If the winding hose is extremely long, it can get frustrating to someone who has little patience.  Also note: From experience, if the hose you are using has a rubbery outside, it can get really stuck, so I do not recommend that type of hose for this product.  Other than the track issue which is a learning process to deal with, I have not had any other issues with mine, and it functions well even after 2 years.  I do believe that the benefit here outweighs the little snags.  Make sure you pull the hose straight out first, then take it where you need to; and on the way back in, it does the work - you just need to guide it a little."

1054,524,4,"This is my first hummingbird feeder I've owned, so I can't compare it to any others.  The instructions on the bottom of the feeder were very vague.  However, after 5 minutes of my time, and through trial and error, I figured out the problem that some of the previous reviewers were having.1.  The bottom half of the red base either was not tightened enough during the manufacturing process, or came loose during shipment.  You need to tighten the bottom half of the base by screwing it clockwise - as there is a seam there and it will leak if not tight.2.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Keep the clear section pushed down until AFTER you fill it.  (it needs to form a vacuum and it won't if you pull on it during this step).3.  Fill the clear section with nectar, and put the lid on quickly to form the VACUUM so it won't leak out the holes.4.  Hang it with the included small S-hook, and THEN carefully pull on the bottom of the feeder so the nectar can flow into the flower ports.  BUT you still need to keep the feeder level; otherwise the nectar will flow out the flower port holes.Practice first by putting water in it and you'll see what I mean.I can see where this will be very easy to clean, haven't had to yet since I just recently received it, but I anticipate no problems with it at all.  It's been hanging up for 4 hours (as of the time I wrote this review), and I already saw a pair of hummingbirds stop by for nectar, so it must attract their attention.  It's a nice low budget (all plastic) feeder, the vine perches are a cute touch."
394,641,3,"This cart arrived earlier than expected however nothing else about it is exceptional.  I would hesitate to place anything close to the 400 lb capacity advertised or anything with sharp angles because the metal weaving composing the bottom and side gates is not particularly sturdy.  In addition, I had to contact the manufacturer about the fact that the cotter pin-type things holding the ""removable"" gates on fell off within five minutes of maneuvering the cart across a gravel drive.  The manufacturer was apologetic and said they could send out new ones.  I explained that the pin design is completely inappropriate and they do not stay in place and sending new ones won't fix the issue.  He then proceeeded to explain how I might go to the hardware store and purchase some kind of a spacer that would work better....Geez, isn't that what THEY should be doing??  Exasperating but other than all that, the cart is well put together and I could recommend it for light to moderate duty activities.  just be prepared to have to retro-fit the side gates to keep them on."
728,685,5,"This was a great purchase for the money.  Cheaper than Lowes/Home Depot.  I am using it with a Sprayer hose (not a soaker hose) to water my vegetable garden 2x a day.  It's been in operation almost 2 months on the same batteries and does not leak.  It has withstood multiple thunderstorms, hail, and drops (clutz).  When the valve opens, you know it as it makes a loud click.  It takes a while to get full flow, around 30 seconds to open all the way but the important part about this is that valve fails closed - ie if the device was watering and the battery died, the valve would close rather than run all day long.If this thing only lasts a year or two, it's still worth the price."

Since they are behind some larger bushes, they don't show from the street, so it has become like my little secret garden as I go in and out my front door.However the rabbits that hop around our yard discovered the secret and were soon munching away at my new lovely plants. This spray kept them away, but did not harm them and unlike other animal repellents I have used this did not smell to high heaven, which is always a good thing...to not be greeted by a horrible stink coming and going from your home."
1330,100,3,"I ordered this product to clean bird seed off my back porch. It works if held close to the seed but I don't recommend it.

233,481,5,"We live in a completely wooded area and have mice, voles, etc. getting into the garage, particularly in cold weather.  We don't like using poison for two reasons, one is we have dogs and two the mouse can die anywhere and you have to find it.We used to use Victor M130 traps but the mechanism would often, very often, break after one/two/three uses and while they are inexpensive this does add up.  We currently also use Ortho Press and Set which hold up well but often don't spring with a vole or small mouse so you find the food gone but no mouse.As for the Victor M250.  First nice thing, while in a plastic package the package was easy to open, you don't need heavy duty siccors.  Second, it comes with the four batteries needed to use so you are spared looking for batteries.  And a really nice feature (which at first I didn't notice and thought ""where are the instructions""), the instructions are stamped onto the back of the trap so you don't have to either keep them somewhere or just try to memorize them, though its pretty simple.Set up was easy, make sure the on/off switch is set to off, install batteries (the battery compartment even had a piece of cloth to make battery removal easy), and you know you're OK if the light blinks as per instructions when turned on.  I put some peanut butter at the far end of the trap chamber, which is optional.And everything worked!  Only issue is I don't really think the trap chamber will hold 3 mice as claimed without them just being wedged in and hard to get out, even two stacked up would be hard to empty.  Note:  Since we get mice 2-3 days a week in the winter I do check my traps everyday so probably would never get more than one.  Can't really comment on durability but seems well made and can't comment on if there would be an issue with the trap if it ever has to be cleaned out if a mouse left in too long and, for example, sticks to trap itself.Summary:  while expensive I think this is worth it since many traps do seem to break after a few uses and this one really does seem like it will hold up well since it doesn't have springs, etc.  Plus you don't have to worry about getting your fingers caught, there is nothing worse then setting a loaded trap down and having it, for no reason you can figure, snap closed."
1445,792,5,"We love feeding the birds in our back yard, but beyond our bird bath, I never gave much thought to providing water for them.  Wow, they love this--can't believe the activity we have seen since hanging this up.  I only wish I had it last Summer in the heat--but they can enjoy it this year.  I would recommend this for all bird lovers!"
1047,803,3,"Works well with the blower.  Battery life on full power is about 15 minutes which is more than enough to blow the leaves off our driveway, sidewalk and patio.  I do have an extra for backup.  I would give this 5 star if the price was better.  It's just super pricey."
155,388,4,"It's a great cover that works as described and expected.  The complaint about wind pulling it off may be valid although so far, in high gusty winds mine has only shifted around a little but still covers as it should.  I don't know if they've changed it recently, but mine has elastic in a loose gathering at the bottom that may be why it stays on.  To get it over the top you need to stretch it open slightly.If I were to have to list what I'd like to see improved, and the only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I would like for it to be a little longer, although what it doesn't cover really doesn't need protecting.  It could also fit better as although it fits over the top handle, it rests on top of the side handles.  Not really a problem but would look better more tailored to the kettle and the side handles.  That may help with wind moving it around where that's a problem.For me, it works fine and appears to be one that will last, as long as the elastic in the bottom doesn't prematurely age and fail.  It's not the same tough material that for example, a cover I have from Barbecues Galore (from the old days with the original company, not the new company since the Taiwanese company bought them out of bankruptcy) which has lasted unharmed for years in full element exposure, but it's also a fraction of the price.  But it may last just as long."
1611,107,5,"My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business.  I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home.  As expected, we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand.  My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners.  She noted how she's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades. They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact.  The cut is fine and thorough.  The ergonomics are spot-on.

1406,936,5,"Item: Miracle-Gro Seed Starting Potting Mix, 8-Qt.Upon receiving the bag, I noticed how incredibly light it was. Filled with 8 quarts of soil, the soil is very light and airy. It's not dense at all. It's perfect for seed starting. It's about 96% (or more) clean, with only a few small twigs mixed in. The soil itself is excellent. I used only 1 quart to start 48 seedlings. A little over 90% of the seeds sprouted.  Using this seed starting potting mix, the seeds did sprout a tiny bit quicker, maybe by one day, than the normal potting soil I use for seeds. The normal potting soil is usually more dense and not as light or airy. But this mix includes the Miracle-Gro formula to provide continued feeding weeks after sprouting. It works."
227,36,5,"They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it, and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed, but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her."
1392,669,5,"I already have two pairs of 'utility' scissors in the kitchen drawer... why do I need another pair?  Well, what I already have isChicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition Kitchen Scissors, Brownand a pair called ""Catter"", which has patent #272410 from someone in Taiwan in 1984.  As a cook, one of my main uses for kitchen scissors is cutting chickens in half, cutting string beans or herbs, fresh pasta, and other food preparation and gardening.  The catter and Chicago Cutlery scissors have a tough time going through the chicken backbone and my fingers hurt from the pressure needed to cut.  However these Fiskars are much sharper, have better leverage and the handle is more comfortable, making the cutting that much easier.  The Fiskars also comes with a sheath that doubles as a sharpener and packaging tape cutter.The other two pairs include a nutcracker, and the Chicago Cutlery has a flathead screwdriver, but I don't think I will miss those features on the Fiskars.  I probably won't use the bottle opener or wire cutter, but they don't get in the way.  Since we already have and like a couple pairs ofFiskars 12-75807097 Softgrip No.8 Razor-Edged Bent ScissorsandFiskars Classic 8"" Scissorfor sewing and material cutting, I'm thinking we'll be happy with these utility scissors as well.  The two old pairs of utility scissors will be in the next garage sale; I'm keeping the Fiskars!Update:  These don't really cut through chicken very well.  The notch in the blade for cutting twine makes it hard to get enough leverage to cut through the back and ribs to split the chicken.  Looks like I'll be looking elsewhere for a more sturdy pair for the tougher jobs."
90,343,4,This cage is great since you can assemble it piece by piece around an already tall tomato plant without worrying about damaging the it with a traditional cage.  It does get a little tall and unwieldy so I use garden twine and tent stakes to anchor it in place.

466,763,5,"I'm not a big fan of electric power tools, but decided to give this a try, as I had an old one (bought at a yard sale for $2.00), and it worked very well for several years. I'm glad I did.

1640,404,1,"I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful, easy to set, and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill.  I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap, and in fact had a ready test subject targeted, as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement.  I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could  try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed, like the rat version, easy to set.  Just push on the heel of the lid, and it pivots and locks open.  That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait.  I didn't have any of the recommended ""Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel"" in my possession, so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar.  Problem is there's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform.  I suspected the bait might get stolen.  It was.  And the second try also.  By this time, I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three, as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try, I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place.  It worked.  A successful capture this time, but . . . .It didn't kill the mouse.  I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering.  I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat, and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury.  I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps.  Nine out of ten times (or more) they produced an instant kill.  That's what I'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers, and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets.  But I consider these traps unacceptably inhumane and will not use these Tomcat mouse traps again."
1049,923,4,"I really like this Perky-Pet platform feeder, but not for its advertised claims.  It does not keep out squirrels, but in 25 years I haven't found a feeder that really does.  Hairy houdinis can crack the code on just about everything.  Instead, I've learned to hang feeders beyond squirrel reach or use above and below baffling.  Unless one does that, the little baffle and wire grate on this feeder are ineffective.Why do I like it then?  This metal feeder is sturdy, of simple design, holds very little seed, and birds flock to it.  They seem to prefer open platform feeders, and this one has a nice low lip.  I have other expensive cedar platform feeders, but their sides measure 2"".  That may not seem like much, but birds do not like feeling confined, and they're always on the lookout for a quick escape if predators approach.  Consequently, this platform is much more popular than the cedar ones.Having clean and fresh seed in platform feeders is important, so its smaller 1/2 lb seed capacity is ideal.  The wire grate is removable.  I've elected to keep it off permanently which makes for very easy cleaning or tossing of sunflower hulls.  There are small drainage holes in the bottom, but I drilled in a few more, and it was a very easy process.This small feeder sits outside our kitchen window, and has endless bird traffic from dawn until dusk.  They love the feeder, and I sure enjoy watching them while doing the dishes."
1655,15,5,"Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more ""finished"" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these."
1110,167,5,"I've always loved feeding squirrels and birds in my back yard.  That is, until this year, when we adopted two puppies who seem to be BORN squirrel chasers and bird killers (Yorkshire terrier/poodle mixes). As soon as this proclivity evidenced itself last Spring, I had to stop feeding. The squirrels didn't cotton to their new status, and started munching on our pecan tree instead.  Not the nuts.  The TREE.  Unfortunately, this wasn't evident until midsummer, when even large branches started to die.  They'd skinned the bark off large portions of the tree's large branches & by the time we saw evidence of it, our arborist said it was much too late to save. A producing pecan tree has been reduced to a small, sad pile of barbecue wood.I wish I'd found Deer Off sooner; I think we could have saved the little Pecan, because IT WORKS. I'm using it now to discourage the one surviving squirrel from being caught and mauled by the dogs.  I've sprayed it along the top of a wooden fence and into several crape myrtles that were his favorite perches.  So far, so good.  He's staying in the front yard, except for the occasional barking he does at the dogs from the untreated roofline.  And the neighborhood is quiet again.  Peace reigns : )It's easy to spray, thanks to the battery-powered spray head & it even comes with 4 AA batteries so it's ready to go as soon as you are. I was surprised that this didn't have an offensive odor (to humans)--even while spraying, I didn't notice a particularly strong odor, even though the ingredients include ""putrescent eggs.""  But the squirrels and the dogs did.  It doesn't seem to bother the birds.  I applied one treatment exactly one month ago today & it's still working. If you've got a squirrel problem, give this a try.  It's working for me; highly recommended for its ease of use, quick application, and effectiveness.5/24/13 Update:  I got lazy and stopped applying this, since it seemed that all was quiet on the Western Front.

694,383,5,"I decided to clean my 12 year old Weber about two weeks ago. When I took out the flavor bars, I found a set of rusted burners. The little bar that connects the three burners was rusted and broken. It was the original burners. I knew I needed new ones but was afraid with my limited mechanical skills I would not be able to accomplish an installation. I read some of the reviews on this site and was encouraged by others to give it a go. Ordered it using my Prime membership and got it in two days. I really love that service. I followed the easy to read instructions and using nothing but a wrench and a Philips screwdriver installed the burners in less than 30 minutes. Turned the grill back on and amazingly it worked. Yippee. I love Weber. I spent a total of about $150 getting everything but the flavor bars( replaced those about 4 years ago and basically have a new grill. I used to buy the $150 specials at Lowes or wherever and usually had to buy  a new grill every two years or so. With the new parts this grille is good for another 5-10 years. Wonderful."
1449,229,4,"It is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working, but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas I used this. It has a peppery smell which is an irritant. This is obviously how it works. In areas that do not get rained on the odor, and presumably the effectiveness seems to last (several weeks now).  In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective. This may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates.The shaker container is easy to use and stays closed/sealed between applications.So far, so good."
952,43,5,When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them.

897,831,5,"This is actually the second such gadget I have purchased.  One is all right for a small quantity of charcoal, but I sometimes need more charcoal.  The starter is rugged and very well designed.  The directions suggest wearing insulated mitts or gloves when using the starter (and that's always the safest way to use it), but the handle doesn't get hot, and the smaller size of the unit makes it easy to handle.  A full batch of charcoal takes about 15 minutes to get white-hot."
623,266,5,"I was very skeptical of these scoops at first, but I have a lot of leaves to clean up, and figured they were worth a shot.After one afternoon of raking, I am sold. Everyone who has to rake up a lot of leaves each fall should have a set of these scoops!First of all, you can grab a lot more leaves with these than you can with the old hand+rake method. You also get a much better &#34;grip&#34; on the bunch leaves, which makes getting them into the bin easier, with fewer dropped leaves. It's also easier to scrape up those few straggler leaves that always get left behind. It's still a little tricky to get leaves into those brown paper bags (which I was hoping these scoops would help with), but if you just limit the amount of leaves you grab at once, it's still better than just using a rake.These aren't the most heavy-duty pieces of lawn equipment I've ever used... a stiffer/thicker plastic might have been more desirable. But, I think that if I treat them well, they should last a few years at least.In conclusion, if you're sick if cleaning up leaves, get a pair of these &#8211;it will really speed up your leaf clean-up!"
1125,932,5,"I have two dish-style feeders but welcomed trying this pinch waist feeder.  I like the glass body but I'll be able to tell about the bee guards in a few weeks.

As far as cleaning, again, the Perky-Pet 221 Hummingbird Oasis 16-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder is easy enough with little pipe cleaners.  I think this is a quality made product and look forward to years of use with it.The one thing that surprised me was the included packet of nectar.

879,514,4,"This review is a work in progress. As I'm writing now, the date is 5/3/11. It will be updated by 5/31/11, and again as summer rolls on and I have additional information to report. That being said....We live in the Midwest where summer months are extremely important, as we all look forward to sunshine after months of snow. Our property is wooded, and mosquitoes are a huge problem, especially since we do a lot of summer entertaining. After learning how mosquito zappers kill all the bugs that EAT mosquitoes, we tried every other option from foggers to citronella, all with little success and lots of worry about toxins around pets.I installed this unit 4/23. I took a photo, and you can see how it looks in the yard. After some pots of flowers are around it, it will blend in nicely. Setup was VERY easy, and I already had propane tanks that are used for the grill. It needs to be started up early in the season. It is nearly noiseless, and operating perfectly on what seems to be very little propane. Although I'll be updating so you can use this review as part of your decision making for this investment, I do want to share the experiences of my neighbor, who also has the Mosquito Magnet. They have had it for over one season, and had some problems. She kept getting an error light, but was able to troubleshoot it using online support. She said she would not have purchased it if she knew she would be plagued with error messages. She hasn't cranked her older unit up yet, but I'll be including her experiences in my updates. I have it at 4 stars now, as it was easy to install, lets see if it loses those stars in a few weeks!EDIT MAY 26th 2011: One bottle of propane down, and another lure later...not very many skeeters caught. Perhaps I'll try changing location. I spoke more with my neighbor who has one, and much of her problem is blowing it clean when it gets restarted in the spring. More to come in a week or so....EDIT 6/14/2011....The net bag is filled with skeetos! NO other insects, which is VERY nice. So, as a conclusion to this review...This product worked for me. If you think you can set it up and forget about it, you will be disappointed. You may have to move it around to find the best spot in your yard. A few times I checked it only to find it had stopped running. Turning it off for a few seconds and turning it back on took care of that problem. It is expensive to buy, and expensive to run. We have spent about $25-30 this month in propane and the needed lures. Still, it is cheaper and safer than having a service come and spray. MUCH safer. For us, because we entertain outside, it is worth it. While it isn't going to make your yard mosquito free, it will reduce the numbers significantly. My neighbor recently ordered a new cord as hers got lost. It was $50, but it's nice to know they can help with any bits you need. It seems like the company responded to the reviews about poor customer service. If the rest of the summer goes smoothly, we may consider upgrading units next year, that is how happy I am."
1014,790,4,"This ""copper"" colored/finished metal bird feeder is very nice looking.  I like that it is a moderate size(8 x 10"") but holds a lot of seed(5 lbs).  The interior is made nicely with a piece that is at an angle and funnels the seed towards the openings.  It also has four drainage holes.  It has a nice cable lock down that secures the lid well and the bird perches are metal and attractive. Each see-through side is made of hard plastic.  In the sun, the plastic ends up cracking but it takes a few years for that.I don't like the cable that it hangs from that is a pewter color and doesn't match the copper.  The cable is just looped to hang from.  I think they could have made it at least match.I also just noticed that it is already rusting on the bottom after two days of rain!  Guess the didn't take the time to seal the bottom where water drips off!Although I am not happy about a few thins, if you are going for a nice, expensive look, this is your bird feeder.

I re-read the instructions and tried resetting the circuit breaker and left it charging for another day and I still could not get it to start.  I called the Toro automated customer service and it directed me to contact a local authorized Toro dealer.  Luckily for me, we have one close by.  I dropped the unit off with a copy of my packing slip and they informed me it would be a few days.  Once I received the phone call to pick up my mower I was told the problem was due to a wire not being connected inside the motor, this probably happened during assembly at the plant.  It was an easy fix for them, all they had to do was plug it in.  I was also told that it was nothing I would of been able to fix on my own since I would of needed a special tool to open the motor compartment. They were even nice enough to register the mower on my behalf in case there are any more warranty claims in the future. The mower comes with a two-year full warranty.I finally get to try out our new mower.  I inserted the key, pulled up on the red lever and it started running beautifully.  It is so quiet when it runs.  No fumes or smoke for me to gag on.  It mulches the grass in a fine grade.  The bag is easy to empty and remove if you don't want use it.  All four wheels are adjustable for your preference in grass height.The only negative things I can say is that the mower does not have any kind of LED status for how much charge is left.  On the average I got about 45 minutes of use on one charge.  There is a status light on the AC plug when charging the unit -- red it's charging, green the charge is complete.  I also was somewhat shock on how heavy the mower is.  We have 2 acres of land, so we use a riding mower for most of the yard except the detailing and trimming around trees and walkways. We have some steep inclines and it was hard on my muscles pushing the mower up hill, it is quite heavy.  Too bad it is not self propelling.Other than the two things I mentioned above, I am extremely please with the even level cutting power and performance of the Toro 20360 e-Cycler.  Emissions free and powerful."
938,688,5,"I really like my B&D Cordless.  It's so handy not to have to worry about gasoline, or lugging out a big extension cord.  I find I trim a lot more often as a consequence.  But what I most like about it is the disposable reels.  Before, I spent more time rewinding the reel than trimming.  The old reel was CONSTANTLY getting snarled, and the line broke after just a few minutes of trimming.  I've used the B&D Cordless for several months, and I can't find a down side.  Of course, with batteries, you're limited in how long you can work.  But since the Cordless comes with TWO batteries, I find I can do my yard before the two batteries are exhausted.  (After that, though, you need several hours of recharge time.)"
294,445,5,"If you have an algae problem in a small pool, with a few suggestions and some patience, this will save the day!We have a 13' Intex above ground pool, and after a hot summer start, the algae got ahead of us.  I tried sucking it through the pump filter, but it's a cheap(but much loved and used)pool and I couldn't clean it out.I didn't want to spend big bucks for a vacuum or drain the pool, so after reading all the reviews on this item, especially the positive ones that were successful, I gave it a try, and by golly, it works.  Here's my suggestions:1. Of course, shock the pool really well2.  Let it settle overnight3. Put one of the two sock-like filters provided with the vacuum over the main filter; the instructions are limited to the box cover and couple sheets of simple drawings.  It runs on 5 D batteries which last 2-3 hours; twisting the torso turns it on and off(we had no problems with that, but do it out of the water.)4.  Buy an $8-10 extension rod at Walmart, pool store or Amazon to save your back from all the bending5. Have a hose ready to rinse off the filter- about every 3-5 minutes6. Carefully, very slowly suck the algae off the bottom; move forward an inch at a time, this is crucial; watch the vacuum as it sucks up the algae off the bottom; when it stops drawing it up or greatly slows- it's time to rinse the filter with the hose.  You can see the algae and debris easily in the filter.Do not vacuum back and forth like a house vacuum or move too fast, or you'll stir up the algae and disperse it.Yes, it's a slow process, but what do you want for $30? And it eliminates leaves and bigger debris much easier. Happy swimming!Addendum- now that it's the end of summer, and I've used this for awhile, I would add that some of the finer algae escapes through the Water Tech filter while I'm vacuuming.  I run the pool's filter as well and eventually between the two, I get the pool clean or at least not green.  But, and it's a big But, it's still a slow process.  For my 13' foot pool, it takes me all week after heavy algae infiltration.  Best is preventative care."
1220,66,3,"A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It's larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn't quite as rigid as I'd like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I'm not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a ""baffle"", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I'm concerned I'll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I've seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it's not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who've discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I'm not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I'm not sure if it's the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I'll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven't seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder's construction, so I'm maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point."
1397,730,3,"I'm 5 feet 3&#34; so the length of this doesn't bother me.  It has a decent heft to it, but it's manageable.  I use this mostly as an edger anyway, so it's pretty much grounded during use on the sidewalk.  The cord is sufficient for my small yard, but I wish it were battery-powered just for the convenience.  With battery-operated yard care machines, you have to be careful to not let the battery die out and with corded machines, you have to watch where you're going otherwise get tangled.  If you have the money for it, battery operated trimmers might be good for the convenience.  Honestly, trimmers don't get a lot of use unless you have a whole lot of ground to cover, so batteries ought to be fine in this case.I'm still trying to get used to the auto-feeder because I have to sometimes manually feed it.  It's easy to assemble overall, and it's a standard price for what you get.  I just wish operation were a little easier. There's nothing really that distinguishes this from other electric trimmers."
201,750,5,"We have two hedges: one is about 24 feet long by the front porch which is easily accessible on both sides and top; the other is about 80 feet long and runs against a four-foot chain link fence which causes problems.For several years I've been using the Black & Decker 18 volt cordless trimmer on the front hedge and that along with the Black & Decker 18 volt cordless alligator chain saw on the back hedge (see links at the end of the review).This hedge trimmer comes ready to use once the battery is charged. Out of the box, the battery was nearly ready to go. Within thirty minutes, I was able to give this a little test to make sure it worked.The smaller hedge was needing normal trimming and this did the job easily, quickly and evenly. The angles I can work at for this hedge make using the trimmer easy to do.The larger hedge was much more work and this trimmer, compared with the 18 volt, made the job much easier (not easy, but easier). This, like the other one, does get heavy. I'm retired and had to take several breaks.The back of the hedge is against a chain link fence and I had to use this vertically between the fence and hedge to get it trimmed. That's one-handed work. Though the specs say the two trimmers are nearly the same weight, this one seemed much heavier for that portion of the job.The battery life is impressive. I did the entire fence side without recharging the battery. The rest of the job did take longer and I did charge the battery after each use. It never took more than an hour (if that) to charge it.I own several of the 18 volt Black & Decker yard tools and saws and have been well pleased with all of them. Some I've used for over six years. This 36 volt trimmer will get a workout. If you have a lot to keep trimmed I think this does it enough faster and cuts enough larger diameter limbs to be worth the price difference over the 18 volt model. Both do the job they are made to do.Black & Decker NHT518 18-Volt 22-Inch Cordless Electric Hedge TrimmerBlack & Decker NLP1800 Alligator Lopper 18-Volt Cordless Chain Saw"
683,396,5,"This grill is actually much more than we expected! We LOVE it! Cooks beautifully! Nice and even ~ great cast iron grate ~ you get those perfect grill marks:~) You can fit a ton of food on this grill. We cooked about 5 lbs. of boneless chicken breasts on it without a problem. We got the adapter hose as well, to hook up to a normal size propane tank (not sure of the pounds of the tank, but it is your standard size). The drip pan is great and you need it. Some of the other models don't have this (or it's optional). Highly recommend. Just pull it out and clean it. I love my new Q220!"
506,274,4,"My first attempt with this setup was not good. My grow light was to high causing the seedlings to get tall, thin and fall over. I also had to much condensation that caused problems. On the second try, I lowered the light to 4 inches high and removed the top cover shortly after the first signs of sprouting. That worked good for me. The heat mat is excellent. Using the heat mat shortens the waiting time for germination to start."
1203,939,5,I asked the hummers how they felt  about this feeder  and they said they really like it  . They like the little perch so they  do not have to keep their wings going while they  dine!  Easy to fill and hang.  As for the free nectar it barely filled the  bottom of the feeder ( the red &#34;bowl&#34; part.) I would recommend.

128,722,2,"I'm laughing at myself right now for being silly enough to order this. This is essentially a big scrubbie pad for a pot.  It is about 1 inch thick. If I were to want to fill a larger, deeper pot than say 12 inches, it would be cheaper to use all potting soil and buy a handtruck to move the pot around on. Come on!! Where's the genius to this?? I will just continue to add styrofoam packing peanuts to the bottom of really large pots that I use. For some reason I had the forlorn hope that this was going to be something special.  Maybe something that expanded when wet or was thick enough to do the job with just one. For this cost It should be impregnated with gold and fertilizer to boot!"
344,144,4,"The Sno Brum works beautifully in plain, regular snow.  It has a large foam &#34;pusher&#34; that pushes show from the windows and surface of the car without stratching the surface of the car.  It is fabulous.  It can handle anything from a light dusting to several inches of snow (anything deeper needs to be done in layers or shifts), and makes it fairly painless to clear the car.However...  it is not perfect.  It doesn't work well in two different situations.1) The Sno Brum will not work well in any snow that has even a small amount of ice and/or freezing rain mixed in.  It can't deal with ice at all.  To be fair, other snow brooms can't handle ice, either.2) The Sno Brum doesn't work well against any irregularities in elevation on the surface of the car.  For example, it doesn't do well against the windshield wipers, against moon and/or sun roofs, etc.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Sno Brum and would recommend it for most winter weather situations."
1139,334,3,"When I was first offered this product for review, I thought ""What a great concept!"" Since I live in a condo and do container gardening outside, I decided to give this product the ultimate test by using it on the container for one of my tomato plants. It stayed there all summer and into the early fall.First off, you're supposed to soak the ceramic piece that's going to go into the soil in water. I totally didn't see that part of the instructions at the time, so that clearly could have impacted the plant sitter's performance that first week or so.  You then put the ceramic piece into the soil and put the long thin tube that is connected to it down into the plant sitter water well that hangs on the side of your plant's pot. Super simple and quick to install.The first problem I encountered is that the LID of the water well would not stay shut. This may not have been a problem if I'd been using it for an INDOOR plant, but it certainly was a problem with an outdoor plant, because all the bugs, dirt and other detritus that swirls around the parking lot of my condo could go right into the water. Over time, even if I occasionally poured out the old water and put new in, a green gunk grew on the inside bottom of the water well. I can't say exactly how much this impacted the plant sitter's ability to keep my plant watered, but I suspect it clogged up the tube somewhat.The end result was that, when comparing my two tomato plants in exactly the same containers with exactly the same type and amount of soil, the plant with the plant sitter generally needed less watering. HOWEVER, in no way would I have been able to rely on the plant sitter SOLELY to water my tomato plant, so I still watered with the hose when necessary (especially during that part of our summer that was over 100 degrees). I could see a small to medium house plant that didn't have a great need for water being able to survive over the long haul with this plant watering system, but not a large plant and not likely one (like my Spathiphillum) that constantly droops unless it is well and regularly watered.I would definitely get another plant sitter for an indoor house plant IF the company could fix the lid problem. The fact that the lid refused to latch and stay shut was a constant annoyance to me this summer...and trust me, I tried many times to get it to latch. I think I succeeded ONE TIME out of an entire summer of tending to my tomato plants...but it didn't stay closed for long.In summary, this plant sitter is a GREAT concept for those who want to have plants but travel often and don't want to pay someone to water their plants while they're gone. It is easy to set up and easy to use. If it hadn't been for the lid issue, I would have happily given this product 4 stars."

820,714,5,"I really like to use this rat/mouse killer bait stations in my shed.  Mice like to make a nest in my wood shed or in my full wood racks.  Having one of these close by is good to help eliminate the mice there.  While having a mouse eat the poison inside isn&#8217;t as pleasant as a trap that catches a mouse as they begin to smell and you have to find them, having them eat the poison outside works well.  Because these bait stations are disposable, there is no need to tough the poison at all."
553,909,3,It does a fine job with old dry leaves but has a tougher time with new or wet leaves or grasses. I  can't rely on it to consistently produce mulch that I can use anywhere in my garden. Here are some pros and cons:Good stuff+ Easily assembled in just a few minutes+ Well built+ Powerful motor+ Adjustable legs. I think someone has even been able to put it directly over a outdoor waste containerBad Stuff- Very loud- Works best with old dry leaves and clippings- Waste bag didn't stay put- Need to triage the leaves to remove twigs or any other tough material.

1640,897,2,"The highpoint of this feeder is the nice-looking unique design, with the ""fly-through"" holes and inner access. It's all metal construction (except for the little plastic slide lock on the upper cable, which holds down the lid) seems decent.  It attract birds well, the smaller ones get inside easily, and it's entertaining to watch.I have a few reservations . . . .  This feeder has no perch or tray.  Birds feed from it by hanging onto the wire mesh and picking the seeds out through the mesh.  Appears difficult, and the larger birds, like cardinals, which often prefer the larger seeds (I'll get to the sunflower seed part), will not fit inside and seem to be ill-adapted to hanging off the sides.  Due to the wire mesh sides, typical small bird seed mix will leak right through the sides.  The label recommends peanuts or sunflower seeds (shelled peanuts??).  When filling, even the sunflower seeds leak quite a bit -- so, a bit messy, and not economical -- but then when hung, the birds have much difficulty digging out seed through the mesh.  It's a whole lot of work for them.The squirrels haven't seemed to have caught on yet, but they will.  When they do . . . the wire mesh sides are ready made for leaping/climbing squirrels, and I suspect over time they may wreck this thing.  (I'll update if that prediction becomes reality).I've only got one other feeder.  It has a plastic dome, tray, perch, confounds squirrels and has lasted for years.  Again, this new Perky-Pet Fly-Through thing looks great . . . but in practice, it doesn't hold a candle to my old cheap plastic reliable.UPDATE after several weeks of use:  No squirrel problems, which I credit to my locating it up under our roof overhang (inaccessible to squirrels).  However, the poor birds have great difficultly coaxing the seed out of this thing.  They have tried but mostly given up.  I give it a few hard shakes occasionally which causes some seeds to fall out onto the patio below.  On behalf of the birds, I've lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars."

If I did have a much larger grill, I might want more than one of these cause you can't get that many chips in it.  It's a very heavy, sturdy  box, so I anticipate it lasting a long time.  I wet the chips, as one of Tom's tips suggested, and I was happy with the amount of smoke that I got -- nice smoky flavor on my chicken. I'm new to smoking, and just recently got a grill with a top (as opposed to the Hibachi I was using) so I'm anxious to try the smoker again with it using different meats!"
184,167,4,"The mixture works, and it's nothing too scary, but it has it's limits.First, it's not really for vegetables, due to its' smell/composition.  That being said, it totally worked on decorative plants.  Deer came and left without a nibble.  For some, this is a great scenario.  For others, well the nearby but unsprayed veggies, not so much.  There was an overall reduction however.Second, it's not too cheap.  It's not the priciest solution, but it's not that cheap either.For a smallish ornamental garden, this is a great solution.  For vegetable gardens, maybe not.Overall it's not bad, and the sprayer is the real deal.  I loved it."

8,207,4,"I just received this item a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning.  It appears to be well-made, and I've found it easy to use.  My soil is very compacted and required that I use it ""a step at a time"" sometimes alternating each foot. Where the soil was softer I was able to insert the tines in multiple areas before taking a step forward, which made me able to cover more area.  It is a slow process so I am doing small sections at a time.  A larger, mechanical aerator would be nicer and quicker, but for this money this little Yard Butler suits my needs.  I realize that getting my lawn back up to standard is a work in progress and will take time.  I will update review after I've watered and treated the lawn, but for now I consider this a useful tool.  Best to use after a light rain."
1367,319,4,"This thing is such an absolute delight. Your heat mat plugs into this thermostat and then the thermostat plugs into the wall socket.

To solve this, simply unplug the thermostat from the wall and then plug it in again."
1580,351,5,"I filled it with bird seed and hung it out in a tree where I have a couple of feeders with bird suet and three of the bird socks filled with thistle seeds.  Then I waited.  It ususally takes the birds a few weeks before they will try a new feeder, but the squirrel only waited a few days.  The squirrel that likes to frequent our bird feeders stopped by one morning and his antics as he tried to get to the bird seed made my family laugh till we cried.  He jumped on the feeder from a tree branch and he held on until it finally stopped swinging.  Then he tried coming down to an opening to get to the bird seed, but of course the opening closed.  He kept trying all the openings, but no luck.  Then, he scampered back up the tree and down the branch to the feeder and holding on to the perches at the openings (which closed from his weight) he tried shaking it back and forth.  I guess he thought he could spill it onto the ground.  That tactic didn't work either.  He still hasn't gotten any bird seed out of that feeder.  I think the birds love it as I have seen them out there eating and I have filled it up numerous times now.  The feeder keeps the squirrel from getting the bird seed and it is a lot of fun to watch!  I highly recommend this bird feeder to those who love birds and also share their yard with squirrels."

Seems like that should be an easy enough thing to find, but either the hose portion or the connector hardware  of the short garden hoses I came across looked as though they'd be leaking before long.  From customer reviews of this and other Camco products I sensed that this hose would be of good quality.  I wasn't disappointed.  The hose has a substantial feel, and all parts appear to be of quality material and construction.  I brought it indoors for the winter  after leaving it outside lying on the ground for 6 months. After cleaning it up it looks like new - no kinks and absolutely no corrosion whatsoever on the connector hardware. I highly recommend it."

I see why it rusts prematurely: the finish has many imperfections and bare spots.  I am attaching a collage of 4 photos (they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo) outlining several areas of defective finish.

1350,788,3,"I have had this feeder in front of my house for about a month now but it doesn't seem to be attracting any birds. I previously had a smaller bird feeder in the same place and the bird seed would go faster from that feeder, but the big birds broke the bottom part so I needed to replace it.Maybe it is the bird silhouettes on the sides of the feeder that is making it so no birds come up to it. Or maybe it is the little perches for them to stand on to eat the food. But, whatever it is this feeder is not popular with the birds around my house. I usually get blue birds and finches that come and eat at my feeder, but so far I haven't seen either come to this one.Overall look is very appealing. It is much nicer looking than my old feeder. It is pretty to look at and looks nicer in front of my house. It is a pretty hefty as well, feels nice and solid."
729,105,4,"Pros:1) Beautiful sear marks and flavour2) Preseasoned, so it's easy care, just wipe down with an oily paper towel, and remember to cleanup the ash after use.3) Simple effective no-frills design.4) Can be used as an outdoor firepit.5) Sturdily built.6) The oval shape is much more space-efficient than the round one:a) for finding somewhere to put it,b) the cooking surface - you can fit 6 burger patties on this, flank steak, a full rack of ribs, good sized slab of salmon...(not all at once!) plus two or three medium potatoes wrapped in foil next to the coals.  You can cook for 2-6 pple.c) in arranging the coals for the right type of heat for what you want to cook.Cons:1) No lid -- For a lid, I would suggest the Cajun Classic brand cast-iron oval dutchoven flipped upside down.2) Matching oval-shaped Lodge cast-iron Dutch oven is discontinued (could be used as lid, griddle and dutch oven).3) It is heavy4) It is ugly5) Design too basic? Could be made more user friendly with height-adjust option during cooking.  Currently, you have to flip the grill over to change height.You have to really know your coals. Not very charcoal-phob friendly.6) Limited use:a) Cast Iron retains heat and cools slowly, so not very pratical for anything where you might have to move it before it cools.b) Needs to be baby-ed: water + ash = lye, which will eat away at the cast iron bottom causing rust. So no open grilling in a snowstorm, during unstable weather, or leaving out overnight to cool.  You have to go back out when it cools to put it under some sort of cover.Needful accessories:1) Oval dutch oven to be flipped upside down and used as a lid.2) Chimney starter.3) dutch oven lifter which can we used to lift the grill grate and adjust the height while grate is still hot.4) alternately a pair of heat resistant gloves.5) 2 pairs of heat resistant tongs, one for fiddling with the coals/ash and another for cooking with.6) The nylon cover to help protect it from weather (better than nothing, but a garage or shed is best).Conclusion:Love it for its efficient size and shape, great sear marks and flavour.  Hate it for when the sky threatens to snow/rain.Precaution for those who live on the shore:I live by the shore and have salt water mist roll in overnight.  I MUST move it into the shed, as moisture/mist/condensation will collect even under the protective covering.  Also, a well oiled and cleaned grate will rust in the salt mist if left out overnight."

Some of the big fancy ones are too expensive and don't work as well as this tried and true design. We are very happy with this copper glass hummingbird feeder. It has the same design functionally as the classic red plastic feeders, but looks so much better. The only red is the &#34;flowers&#34; the birds feed out of (and the nectar if you choose to color it).Birds love it, it's easy to clean, and best of all it blends into or more modern landscaping.One of the best features is the wide-mouth spout so it is super easy to fill and clean. We haven't had any problem with leaking."
1617,433,5,"We had this bird-feeder set up in no time and it looks great. We hung it on a tree in the backyard. The birds really love it, they are eating up the seed so fast it is hard to keep it filled!We haven't had any complaints about it so far and everyone that has seen it thinks it is nice."
1259,777,5,"Please see images. This is a BIG bird feeder, it holds nearly 5 lbs at a time! I like to use the ""waste free"" bird seeds, so it costs about $12.50 to fill this! It looks great, features a clever spring clamp to keep the lid on tight and squirrels frustrated. The sides are a kind of clear hard plastic. My old bird feeder featured a tube made of similar material which oxidized over time, so I'll see how this ages.The lower section, the lower cylinder, relies on four tabs formed in the plastic to hold on to the middle divider. The top cylinder on the unit I received had two of the four tabs broken off (see images) but since the top lid doesn't rely on them, it's not a big deal. The next time I have the Crazy Glue out I'll try and glue the broken tabs back on there.I've got the feeder filled and hung, but I'm still waiting for birds to discover it. After the ""economic downturn"" putting bird seed out was one of the things I cut back on. So I'm looking forward to the local birds re-discovering the feeder in the backyard.Really nice bird feeder. Very attractive design. Holds a lot of bird seed. Looks fairly squirrel-proof."
229,167,5,"I've had this on the plants for about a week now and so far I have seen less damage from the deer.  That might be somewhat seasonal, so I'll have to watch and see over the long term how effective this is.  I've also sprayed it around the trash cans to keep the raccoons away and it has been effective at that too.  I can certainly smell it myself, so this is not something you'll want to spray onto plants  near a door or window.  Thanks to the powered spayer, it is easy to apply.  In that regard I think this would be an excellent product for anyone with limited strength or mobility.  I can definitely see this as being helpful for an older person with a lot of property or greenery who has a critter problem."
115,387,5,"I have seen my family start charcoal with lighter fluid as a kid growing up.  Now that I am an adult i remember the meat tasting funny, like it had a hint of lighter fluid.  I read on improving my grill and smoking skills.  I read the benefits of using a Chimney Starter.  Now when I use the chimney starter, my meat that gets cooked in smoker or grill does not taste any lighter fluid no more.  I now mesquite, applewood, cherry wood in my meats now.  Great improvement."
92,117,5,"I like virtually everything Fiskars makes, and this little axe is no exception.  Kept sharp, it cuts any wood briskly and evenly."
412,777,4,"This is a beautiful and stylish feeder.  I've only used it for a few weeks but it seems well-made and sturdy, and the feed doesn't get wet during a heavy downpour of rain.  But the best part of this feeder is the dual compartments that let use two different feeds in the same container.  There is also a hollow tube down the center that allows you easily fill the bottom compartment without disassembling the entire thing.  This is a very nice feature, but I wish the tube extended all the way to the top of the upper compartment.  The tube stops about a 2 inches from the top so you need to be careful when pouring the seed into the tube (they tend to go flying).  In the end I found a funnel that made the job of fill the bottom compartment a lot easier.The only hesitation I have about the feeder is that it attracts doves that monopolize the feeder and scare off the smaller song birds.  The perch encircling the feeder is wide enough for the doves to balance on, so they will sit on the perch and eat and eat and eat until everything is gone.I have a second feeder with a smaller perch and this seems to work much better in my yard.  The smaller birds eat from the feeder and the doves sit on the ground and gobble up whatever falls their way.So if you have a lot of dove or black birds in your area, this might not be the best choice."
1664,185,5,"This trap takes lots of abuse and just keeps working. Does better than others and doesn't need fancy bait. Our mild weather has brought out huge numbers of squirrels who are attacking my birdfeeders, chewing things in my potting shed and being very destructive. Because they have learned to jump onto the feeders from the deck railing it doesn't matter that I have a big raccoon baffle, in fact that seems to give the squirrels a nice place to stand while they dismantle the suet holder.  My feeders are squirrel proof but for one tray that encourages some bird types I like to watch but now I seem to be feeding more squirrels than birds.  This spring we've just been overrun and I knew I had to do something.I put the trap along the deck railing.  It is relatively narrow, although long, and fits on the railing with only about an inch of overhang.  I set it and then drop some birdseed in through the top beyond the trigger panel.  This is super easy bait and lasts even through rain storms.When a squirrel is trapped, the trap usually falls off the railing onto the ground below.  It stays shut and the squirrel can't get out.  Even after having this happen multiple times, the trap can still be reset and remains effective.  It is getting a little bent, but still works.I was given another (and more expensive) trap that was easier to set, but the mechanism rusted and it wouldn't spring shut.  This one sat out in the weather for a year before I started using it and it is still fully functional."
825,307,5,"In an area overrun with squirrels, I've been searching for a catch and release trap. This is exactly what I needed. It's large enough to trap other nuisance animals too (skunks, etc) but perfect for the squirrel problem that we have. It's much easier to set than the older style traps, this can be done with one hand. It's also a one-hand release which keeps you further away from the animal. The trap is sensitive and closes in an instant. The only thing I didn't like is that the holes are pretty big and the trap food is hard to get inside unless you're using something large (we used peanut butter on pretzels and they fell through). Otherwise, very very happy with this trap."
905,674,2,"We had pantry moths.  Really. No denying it. So I threw out all our contaminated or potentially contaminated food.  I know that you would generally expect to have some adults lurking around.  We had a big enough infestation that I'm sure they were around somewhere.  I put a few of these traps out all over the pantry.  I caught ZERO moths. I thought maybe i put them in the wrong place so I opened the second package and pretty much had them littered everywhere.  I I finally caught one..  By the time I gave up I caught one moth and one spider spider that had probably wandered onto the trap.  Maybe mine were old, I'm not sure.  I expected to catch more than one based on the amount of larvae I came across!  I changed our storage method and have been moth-free since.  But its probably more to do with the storage than removing the adults!"
1213,451,5,"I had read some of the other reviews on electric tillers and was worried about this one constantly overheating and cutting out.  That did happen to me when the tines are clogged with St. Augustine grass shoots.  Once I had eliminated the grass, this thing was a worker.  I ran it for about 90 minutes without overheatings.  It is strong, tills deep and well, performs almost as well as a gas tiller with far less maintenance and noise.  I definitely recommend one of these bad boys.  They are really work savers."
309,298,5,The Victor M240 Electronic Rat Trap is very effective in getting rid of rats. The Victor Electronic Rat Trap is very easy to use. It zaps the rats with an electronic charge and kills them instantely. I have used this for some time and it has been very effective.
847,934,4,"While I am an avid vegetable/herb/flower gardener, I don't do many potted plants (too much work in the hot deep south to keep them watered!).I do, however, buy one hibiscus every year for my deck.  I used the Miracle-Gro Garden Soil for this year's hibiscus.  I didn't have any gnat/maggot/bug problems others have mentioned.  Nor did I have a lot of rocks/bark/sticks.  It's always weird when you read reviews for a product that are nothing like what you've experienced.So, the hibiscus is alive and well and putting out leaves and flowers just as it should.  The soil holds water very well without being waterlogged.I'm happy with it for using in potted plants.  I will note, however, that I would never use this in my garden beds, especially for vegetables, herbs or flowers that I was going to consume as I only use organic materials from local, reputable sources or my own compost or worm castings for that purpose."
1289,821,5,This trap is very easy to bait and set. I like not using poison because we have pets. We live in the country and mice always come inside when the weather gets cold. Yes we kill them but it is as humane as I care to be. They are attacking us...if they stayed out then I wouldn't bother them. They cause fires and water leaks and all sorts of problems. This trap could just save your house or your life.
1350,838,4,"Right now, I have only been using this hose for a week and so far I haven't had any issues. It is lightweight and easy to handle. Because of the lightweight aspect it does make the hose seem flimsy and weak, but it is doing its job for now. I have seen a lot of reviews of these breaking so I will keep watching it and update my review if anything happens.The color is very bright, a lime green color. And when I turn off the water, it will continue to spray until the hose shrivels down to a smaller size and then it stops. It is easy to move around my yard. No trouble with kinks in the hose either."
1253,184,4,"We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area. Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well. There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them, and those ones don't work worth a darn.The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job. The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it. Follow the directions."
1274,378,5,"Not only is it easy to hang on the side of the Weber to hold all required tools, it allows air to feed the fire just enough to allow the top vent to be closed completely. Closing the top vent keeps the majority of the heat in, giving a good roasting action on chicken and turkey. It's a must have for any Weber grill!"
1413,337,4,"I like the large capacity, and the hummers liked it right away. I guess I've gotten spoiled, but I miss a bee guard and ant moat. I made my own ant moat. A hanging wire would be nice. But I really appreciate the wide filler. Assembly was a little tough with my arthritic thumbs, but I got it done. The most important thing is that my tiny hummingbirds like it."
769,872,5,I liked that this keep my pool nice and clear. I liked that this did not foam up like most do. I also like that it works fast. This is also great in my hot tub as well.  This leaves no odor as well . Does have easy measurements on the side to tell you how much you will need as well as to put in by the amount of the water of the hot tub or spa.
353,472,5,My choice of five stars is predicated on the manner in which the elbows were so easily installed without any adhesive and it fitted perfectly without any signs of leaks. I love the technology it goes in easily but very difficult to be removed. It has been serving me to my satisfaction. It is unique to the specific 1/2' Rainbird line no other pvc elbows can be substituted.
1054,838,3,"This is OK for a very small yard, such as my condo's backyard area, which is a deck with about 200 square feet of grass surrounding it. Perfect for rinsing the dirt and dust off the deck and watering plants. Not enough water pressure for washing the car or any other task. The connectors on both ends are plastic and so far, have not leaked. The heaviest part of the hose is my brass nozzle which feels awkward when you are used to holding a heavy hose. Easy to store, but I don't use the drawstring bag it came in; I have a hose storage container with a lid that looks like a flower pot. This is slightly better than one of those coiled plastic hoses but I would never pay over $20 for a hose such as this one."
1469,923,4,"I like this bird feeder but it is a little too open for my taste.  Our birds are very aggressive and with this easy access most of the seed ends up on the ground.  That doesn't bother the birds, however.  They are content to eat it off the ground too.  The squirrels also have field day at our feeders.  We are trying out various kinds and we really like this one in spite of the open-air quality.  It is also very sturdy."
962,74,4,"I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong."
36,601,5,"UPDATED!  March 30th, 2012.bWhom ever designed this is a GENIUS - so easy on the pack - the most effort involved is moving the bucket/pail of weeds as you pop them off the tool for disposal.  And as a bonus - Use to start your holes for garden flowers and plants in loosened soil.Chickweed/Chicory are deeply rooted in - the easier this great  tool works.  Ergonomically comfortable to use also - Almost Zero bending - releases pulled weeds  so easily - into a bucket where they won't re-seed.Adding pix/ zero bending - clean hands when done. This larger one made a huge popping sound as the tool freed it from a deeply rooted spot it had 'owned' 4 over 3 yrs no matter how much hand digging had been done."
1395,874,5,"I wouldn't recommend this for a serious gardener who has been growing plants for years, but it was a great way to teach gardening basics to my 7 yr old, and let him feel like he was doing everything himself. The pods were a nice way to ensure that something would actually grow, so my son could feel like he has something to show for his efforts.We used his old kiddie pool as our garden area (filled withMiracle-Gro Garden Soil), and transplanted the successful veggies and herbs to larger areas in my garden, where they are thriving."
274,868,4,"I like the simple look to this basket and its versatile uses. You can remove the chain and use it as a centerpiece for the table on your patio, or attach the chain and use it as a hanging basket. The liner keeps the water from pouring out the bottom allowing the soil to soak up more water and I have found it to be quite effective at holding water. The liner will likely only last a year but the basket can be relined with moss, or other similar basket liners. The chain is sturdy and the basket has a nice weight to it when full. This is a great investment, but I would like to see the price a bit lower."
125,167,1,"it was easy to assemble, it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that's all it did. The rabbits came last night, and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage. I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine. 10 1/2 hours later, all the 25 ft. row of collarobi (sp) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets. They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down. It DOESN'T work. All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray doesn't matter if it doesn't work and it doesn't.... I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in, coons and skunk and deer can't. Save your money............. put barbed wire around your garden...UPDATE: I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it, including the motor on the sprayer. I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES, I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing..... The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless..."
1468,308,5,"When I lived in Peru I used the Mantis 120-Volt Electric Tiller/Cultivator to work a large, extended field.  It's Electric so I had to use a generator, fortunately I rigged it up to run on ethanol fuel (corn) so I wasn't contributing to oil exploitation.The Tiller/Cultivator is not at all bad for the ground and I was done in no time and able to plant my seeds.  It works adequately and is quite suitable for medium rough soil.  I even lent it out to the village and it held up after one year.I wouldn't mind if it operated on pig waste either if I could convert it somehow.  In all, if you are just using the Tiller/Cultivator on a patch of yard, you'll be able to plug it in.  The electric motor is quiet so I did not disturb the local bird crops which gather in the dusk."
1664,167,4,"While the product only worked until it rained, the battery powered sprayer made respraying easier than other options.  On the good side, having a periodic deterrent seems to discourage deer enough that they are getting less likely to come around.  I actually have day lilies for the first time in years.  Squirrels are a different matter and I need to keep up the respraying consistently if I want them away from my birdfeeders.  I just don't have to respray all around the gardens every time.The container comes with a sprayer in the 'holster' which attaches under the cap.  After opening the container the first time, you put the hose of the sprayer down in the container and close it with the hose's cap through which the hose is threaded.  The holster does a great job of holding the sprayer when not in use. The unit comes with batteries installed and is ready for use. It takes as much as 30 seconds to 'prime' the sprayer when pressing the trigger at first, but not so long during subsequent applications.  You can adjust the spray from a fine mist for nearby application to more of a stream if spraying something further away.I spray around my birdfeeders where it's easy to see how effective the product is and sure enough, no squirrels come to the area for several days. When it rains, however, they were back.  The birds aren't deterred at all, but my dog is.  He doesn't like the scent any better than the squirrels apparently.  I didn't find the scent to be a problem for me while spraying though.Unlike the granules, which I also tried, this method is more cost effective as I can get many applications from the one large container.  For deer of course the granules aren't very useful as I've found I really need to actually spray the foliage the deer would be inclined to eat.  I've tried dozens of deer deterrents and although some are as effective (like the rosemary oil spray), I really do like this battery operated approach as I have rather a lot to spray.  For the squirrels and night critters, I just like the ease of use this product offers.  If it worked longer, I'd give it five stars, but so far I don't mind reapplication too much."
1442,216,3,"Bought this to mix in with my soil that I was using in 2 earth boxes.  One box has herbs the other box has a small pepper plant, basil and a pepper plant that was cut down to the stem as my dog had ate it before i could plant it.  The herbs are doing ok not much better that a box I planted not using the azomite.  Some of the herbs have taken off while some are growing at a reasonable pace.  The box with the peppers and sage are doing no better than if I had not used them.  It has been 3 weeks since I planted and in my mind everything is growing at the expected pace.  The one thing I was hoping for is that my pepper plant that was chewed up would make a recovery which dispite all I have done fo it looks like it will die.  I do plan on using again to ammend the soil for my front yard raised bed that has all flowers hopefully i will get bigger blooms."
460,145,5,We are enjoying this feeder so much!  the squirrell free mechanism works great and the adjustment allows us to cut off larger undesireable birds as well as squirrels.  we especially get a kick out of watching squirrells trying to access the food.!  It is also very easy to refill and we have not had any issues with the feed getting wet or clumpy.  Well worh the extra money!
891,316,4,"Being a new pool owner I don't know if by using this stuff I am eliminating the need to use other chemicals or not.  I have an automatic cleaner, use (3) 3&#34; chlorine tablets weekly and occassionally use muriatic acid to bring pH levels to where they should be.  I add 2 capfuls of the Pool Perfect + Phosfree weekly for my 22,000 gallon pool.  That's it.  My pool is spotless, no issues with discoloration, cloudiness, or smells.  Someone also commented that our water doesn't have that chlorine smell to it.  I don't know if it's because of using this or what?  Our chlorine levels are in line with what they should be."
1284,798,3,"The beauty you see in the pictures for this hummingbird feeder is reality:  it really is a nice looking feeder.  And on top of that, it's very sturdy and high quality - should last for years, even if you drop it a few times.Depending on how your yard currently looks, the ""antique"" may not add much character to your yard - from a distance, it can just end up looking like your grandpa made his own feeder.  Additionally, I have this hanging nearby some shrubs that hummingbirds seem to enjoy, and thus far, they've avoided it completely.  Not sure if they don't like the red nectar stuff I put in it, or the glass causes some kind of glare that they don't like or what, but they haven't taken a sip.Overall...it's nice, but I'm still waiting for the birds to realize it's for them.**UPDATE, 1 week later:  Not a single bird has spent any time with this at all.  None, whatsoever.  It's rather cool looking for people, but birds don't seem to like it.  Down to 3 stars.**"
1547,773,4,"Napoleon isn't as well known in the charcoal grill market as say, Weber. However, they have a hit on their hands here. The Pro22k is very well built, solid and is ultra easy to use. The hinged lid and grilling surface are awesome. I really wish the wheels were a little sturdier to match the rest of the construction.The cast iron grill is great as well, however this brings up one of the issues I had, which was packing. The grilling surface was on the bottom of the box, not well padded. Mine came broken. Called customer service which is nice, speaks english (no overseas call center!) and was happy to send me a new one. Unfortunately it was the wrong one. So they sent another.That snag aside, this is a good quality grill that will give you more than one season like some of the cheapy webers you might normally buy."
18,387,4,"I'm a total Weber/charcoal fan, and I've always been the griller at my house.  So how did I manage for 25+ years using lighting fluid?  Who knows.Once I discovered the Chimney, it was all over for lighting fluid, wondering if the fire would really start, watching my ex go out and re-douse to coals because he was sure they wouldn't start (hey, we've all done it, just admit it...prepared to go up in flames just because we want to grill some burgers).  Now that I have a Chimney Starter, I'm pretty much assured every fire will start.  A couple of sheets of newspaper, new coals in the bottom, any old coals in the top, 15-20 minutes, and we are good to go. Kingsford remains the best charcoal in my area.  And there's one less toxic chemical in my garage.My Starter has been going strong for about 7 years now, with no problems. Combine it with a long Bic lighter, and you have a perfect gift for a griller!"
1173,738,5,"I bought this so I could vacuum my swimming pool,,  and it does that  just fine.I wish it was about 5 feet shorter but I did notice around here the shorter the hose the more expensive it is."
1248,189,3,"We decided to use this deer repellent to try to keep the deer away from our ancient pear tree. We installed the system about a month ago and of course, it's a bit hard to tell if it's actually working. I can tell you, though, that there have been no deer tracks within the area that we placed the stakes. A good sign!The only reason I gave this product three stars instead of five is because there is little to no information that comes with the system. A comprehensive set of directions would have been wonderful. Also, you have to really keep an eye on it so that you will know when you have to change the battery. Other than that, it seems to be working just fine."
239,320,5,"I have been using this stuff since.....well, 40 years, and I still think it is the best thing out there to make plants stay happy!"
885,312,5,These washers are an excellent fit for my 5/8-inch hose ends. Old washers do tend to dry out regularly and the fact that Amazon carries these washers makes it much easier to replace them as needed.
372,545,5,"Great watering can. I love the fact that there are two handles, which is great for heavy buckets of water. I found that the two spout options are nice. I used the shower spout to water my hanging baskets, and used the pour spout for watering my bushes. The watering can is a nice size, so I am able to water more than one plant at a time. Anything with a Fiskars name, I have found to be a very good and durable product. Once again, well done Fiskars!"
384,74,4,"I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side."
667,870,5,"We use our tub occasionally.. perhaps once a month now that we have a busy young family.  Our 2002 CalSPA Atlantis has been through the Ohio outdoor challenges,  frozen over due to failed pumps and electricity, etc...  It's been through the war of environment vs tub.  One thing we don't get to do during the winter season is to change out the water as often.  Even with regular chlorine shock, the tub can get s ring of film and feel less fresh.Using Orb-3 initially had a bit of extra debris.. someone called it cheese...  that apparently is the solution deep cleaning your pipes and unseen areas...  after a full water change and regular use, the water is clearer and we feel that its fresher than just water changes, wipe downs, and chlorine...  We will continue to keep Orb-3 in our maintenance regiment."
1339,167,5,"I have only recently started using this product. I didn't want to build a fence to keep rabbits out of my flower beds, so I decided to try this product. So far we are seeing good results. This seems to be a good inexpensive alternative to pricey unattractive fencing. This product is very easy to use, I really like the battery powered sprayer. No pumping or mixing, just squeeze the trigger, walk and let the spay do its job. Try this product before purchasing a fence for your gardens."
1608,46,5,"I have never run across a Fiskars product I did not love. These small pruners are no exception.  I found them ideal for pruning houseplants and shrubs (like azaleas) that produce small flowers and need regular deadheading.  They are a perfect fit to get between stems throughout plant. Not recommended for thorny type plants, like roses. I have every fiskars tool that I have purchased or inherited."
1373,722,3,"This is either very cool drainage for potted plants, or the world's largest frying pan scrubber.It's a great idea.  Those green scrubbing things you use on your pots and pans and stovetop drain very well, when they're not attached to a sponge.  They take quite a long time to break down, so I'm going to guess that this disc will last a long time.  (I'll update my review if it breaks down quickly.)  But at its current price, I could go to the supermarket, buy two dozen store brand scrubbers, and have cash left over for potting soil.  (If you do that, watch out for thesoap loaded scrubbers.)  I was able to cut it to size, though it takes a bit of effort because it's so thick.It's true that this will be much lighter than filling a very large pot with rocks for drainage.  If that's a high priority and these are within your budget, go for it."
275,267,5,"We have a major ferrel cat problem in out neighborhood and this has been a great trap for catching the varmints so they can be handed over to the local shelter.  Setting it is incredibly easy, most cats don't fear it and the trap is quite harmless and safe for both the cat and you.I do not see any flaw in the trap that could make it better.  It catches varmints you do not want like skunks, but it isn't like it could be made to only work for the critter you want.  And cat bait is cross, but tit isn't the trap's fault.I did find a way to make it more effective.  A wireless speaker making kitty noises draws the cats to it faster.  And closing the trap for the night cuts back on unwanted varmints like raccoons and skunks.There may be a better trap, but I haven't found it."
1144,798,5,"I have a similar hummingbird feeder that is made with red glass. I like this design better, it has a greenish cast to the glass like it is an antique. But I did wonder if hummingbirds might be attracted to the red glass more. I have this hanging on a tree in my backyard and the hummingbird seems like both feeders equally well. But I still like the green glass better."
137,915,3,"While I find these to be cute as a decoration for the corners I still had to use long screws to make the bed stay firmly together. I didn't want to spend the money for 2&#34; thick cedar, so I bought untreated pine, it will probably only last a few years and then I will be able to check the brackets for rust. I was able to put 8&#34; high lumber into them although the bracket itself is about 6&#34; high. I have another raised bed made from 1/2&#34;  cedar that slide down into grooves on cedar 4&#34; posts. I prefer the cedar as it lasts a lot longer than pine as it is rot resistant."
501,857,5,"Keeping small engines running for years basically comes down to using fresh fuel, regular oil changes, and simple maintenance. This kit is a one-stop shop that addresses all the major issues.It contains fuel stabilizer to keep gas from gumming up the carb (and also lets you avoid the messy task of draining the fuel in the off-season). Next is a quart of oil (SAE 30) for oil changes, followed by a spark plug and an air cleaner filter replacement. I used mine on my Honda-engine pressure washer with excellent results.Each part could be purchased less expensively at an auto parts or small engine shop (or big box hardware store, but they tend to be hit and miss when it comes to certain parts, especially air filters). The advantage of this kit is ease of purchase (just one click). Plus, the package it comes in serves as a collection bin for the old oil until you can get it to a recycling center (please don't dump it down a drain or outdoors!).Pricy, but convenience always costs. Definitely worth getting if you want a one-stop solution to small engine maintenance."
485,648,5,"I put a 9'x4' flower bed in front of my porch in March 2012 and have really enjoyed it. The only part I don't like is the weeding. When I planted the flower bed, it seemed like weeding such a small area regularly would be no trouble at all. More experienced gardeners are probably enjoying a good laugh at that. LOLWhat I didn't expect was how stubborn so many of the weeds and grass would be - many would break at the stem and leave the root in the ground. I resolved to get a weeding tool to help.Last weekend I attacked that flower bed with the Fiskars 7060 Softouch Weeder and I can ecstatically report that it was MUCH easier to weed that flower bed with this tool! The long, forked tip really gets into the ground to loosen the root, even with the tenacious grass.The grip was so comfortable to use that I will definitely consider the Fiskars line of gardening tools the next time I need something.I would highly recommend this weeder to anyone who needs to weed a small area like a flower bed."
1094,92,5,This is really nice!  It's also bigger than I expected it to be.  It attached to my deck rail very easily and seems really good and sturdy.  I put a heavy pot of flowers inside and it looks great! It hold the pot in place nicely with very little movement and it's so well constructed that it doesn't take away from the look of the pot itself. I plan on getting some more of these!
1208,762,4,These Global Garden Friends Ultimate Plant Clips work well on both Tomato and Bean plants. My sister is the gardener in the family and she keeps a garden all year in the southern part of the country so we tried these out on the plants she had in the ground.The clips attach nicely to the little green garden stakes and it is easy to route the stems through the clips for the needed support. These blend in with the plants and look fairly natural.These are fairly expensive but work as described.Recommended!CFH
517,653,5,"I really love this feeder.  So do the hummingbirds!  I had several of them the first day I put this up and they continue to come. I put two images up to show how they just sit there, resting and looking around.  This is the first feeder I've had where they do that and it gives you a chance to watch them for a bit. The rest were all the kind where they hover for a few seconds and then take off, but this one they sit for minutes at a time, until they get spooked off by movement (usually me trying to capture them through my window.)It is super easy to fill and clean too .  I have no complaints at all about this feeder, I am very happy with it."
749,906,3,"This Scotts hose is heavy duty and seems well built but it has a major flaw in my book: it kinks when you're moving it around.  The kinking isn't as bad as some hoses I've used, but it happens plenty often and prevents me from being able to recommend this hose.Aside from the kinking, the construction seems top notch.  The hose feels a bit &#34;plastic-y&#34; and is slippery to handle when wet.  The connectors are reinforced so they shouldn't leak or break off any time soon.It's a nice bonus that this hose is lead free.  If it didn't kink up, it would have been a winner for me."
1625,577,4,"I hate mice.REALLY hate them.But, as much as I hate them, I don't want them to suffer.So I've been buying and trying various ways to kill the little devils. I'd abandoned conventional snap traps as too gross and you don't always get a clean kill. I don't like the idea of glue traps because the poor mouse suffers. The same with poison, plus I hate finding mouse carcasses scattered around. My favorite way to dispatch them is to use electronic mouse traps. They die quicly and probably painlessly, but you have to empty the trap and that can be gross. My wife wants nothing to do with disposing of the remains.For the squeamish, the victor kill and seal is a good option. It kills them quickly and seals up the remains permanently. They're pretty easy to set up and place. But my biggest problem with the solution is the cost per trap. It's about double what I'd pay for a trap, but it does work as advertised. I think Victor's overselling the parasite angle, but I think most people would be more interested in hiding the body and not having to worry about seeing it afterward. For a major infestation, it can be an expensive option. In that event, consider buying the Victor electronic trap."

1607,449,4,"I have used the Safer Brand Moth traps for the moths that live in things like flour and, in my case, bird seed.  They have always worked great at getting rid of my moth problem when I get new food for my birds.  When I saw these, I decided to try them for clothes moths.  Once again, they worked well.  The traps attracted the moths with the pheremone scented square and the stickiness kept them there.  Important to note, the instructions tell you that just trapping the adult moths will not keep your clothes from being eaten since it is the larvae that eat them.  Follow the instructions and you will eliminate your clothes moths.  If you have the other kind of moths that live in your pantry, check out Safer Brand's other moth traps."
756,182,4,"I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing no end of problems.  I had a ""Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap"" which works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice, but if you're trapping chippies, get the 1025 instead."
311,925,1,"Update:  I initially gave this product 3 stars, mediocre, for the reasons below.  However, I have now experienced more of the problems that some of the other reviewers encountered, and this waterer is pretty much useless to me.  When I filled the empty container this morning, I apparently did not have it centered right on the hook, and water spilled out continuously.  I tried twice to recenter it, but could not get it laser-level even, and it spilled until it was completely empty.  No wind today.  Don't the designers actually test these things??~~~~~~~I like the idea of this bird waterer.  The birds have not used it yet, but I think they probably will as weather gets hotter and water gets scarcer.  Previous to getting this, I used a hummingbird feeder as a waterer, but that, of course, limits the kinds of birds that can use it.  (The feeder leaked, and I didn't want sugar water on the ground attracting ants, but a little water leaking was okay.)So, this product should have been ideal.  And it would have been had it been better designed and made.The reservoir is quite large, and when I am filling it and holding it by the saucer underneath, the saucer is so flimsy that I'm afraid it is going to break.I couldn't carry it outside without spilling on the floor between the kitchen and back door.  The saucer is too shallow.  I know that birds like shallow water, but the sides still could have been made higher.  There is no lip or anything that helps keep the water from sloshing out.The waterer is hung on my patio, sheltered from most sun and most wind, but still gets a little of both.  The slightest breeze causes it to spill, emptying it in short order.  The saucer is so shallow that I can't even climb onto the chair I use to reach the hook without spilling water, usually down the front of whatever I am wearing.The top is perforated, supposedly to let in rainwater as well as making filling easy.  What it does more often, in this land of little rain, is let in tiny bugs.The reservoir is frosted plastic, but I can't find information on what kind of plastic it is.  I would prefer glass or plastic that is safe for water bottles.  I don't know if this plastic is harmful to birds.It is easy to clean, and the reservoir does hold quite a bit of water.  A smaller reservoir that didn't spill so easily would be a better idea.  I looked at some of the other waterers available, and several have different reservoirs but the same too-shallow saucer underneath.Given the negatives, this feeder with a patio light shining behind it in the evenings makes a very pretty glow.  The birds don't seem to care, though."
354,622,5,My hostas had extensive damage prior to using this product.  Just following the directions I noticed an almost instant improvement  in their condition.  I only had to use two applications and the snails/slugs have not returned so far.  Does the job.
230,196,4,"I used the Deer Off Repellent to keep the rabbits from eating my decorative plants. Bunnies are big problem in my yard. When they find a plant they like they don't just take a few bites, they eat it to the ground. I use wire around my veggie garden but not for flowres. I also have bird feeders in my yard so I needed something non-toxic. Deer Off is made with natural ingredients and the package says it is safe around pets and children.Deer Off comes in a pre-mixed spray bottle or concentrate. I used the concentrate and mixed it for my own sprayer. I have tried using the pre-mixed sprayer and had trouble getting it to spray in a fine mist. When I went to use the remaining quarter of the bottle it was clogged up and wouldn't spray at all. Rinsing out the tubing for the sprayer didn't help. I prefer mixing just the amount I need and storing the rest for later. Plus it's much cheaper to use the concentrate and your own sprayer.Does it work? Yes, it keeps most of the bunnies away. There is still some chewing but I'm not sure if it's a bunny sampling the plant and moving on or some other animal, but there are no more completely devoured plants.The spray seemed safe for my plants, there was no damage or discoloration to the leaves or flowers. The product is supposed to smell bad to the animals but I didn't experience any unpleasant smell.Depending on the taste buds of the critters in your yard this may be the solution but from my experience it's worth a try."

1309,10,5,Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.
1114,517,5,"Akro-Mils 3 level Stack-A-Pot is a convenient way to grow herbs, strawberries and flowers in a compact space.  Each level has 3 sections, giving you a total of 9 sections.  The pot is easy to assemble.  Each layer is offset 120 degrees from the layer below.  There are small grooves on the bottom of each layer to help you line up the pots  Then, because of the connections, watering the top allows water to go to the bottom levels.  Because it is made from plastic, it is light without soil, and does not lose as much water from evaporation.I have been using my Stack-A-Pot on my deck, and it has been great!"
182,398,5,"We had a traditional Weber grill, super heavy-duty but no frills and it was great. But I replaced the burners, flavorizer bars, and grills every few years. The ignition had broken many years ago, the thermometer just blew out, it was ready for retirement (and recycling thanks to a local pick-up service!)So my husband (who is not the grill king in our house...) and I went looking for a new model. There were plenty of fancy stainless steel, triple burner, side grill, super duper manly models. All came with a big price tag, a large footprint, and way too many parts to break. So this was the model we decided on.It arrived from Amazon in a large box, not too heavy and nicely packed. It assembled in just over half an hour (but I had interruptions from kids and phone calls.)The grill is easy to move and sits nicely on our small side deck landing. It is not the thick, super heavy grill body that made up our old Weber so I would think that it may rust through easier but time will tell.The electric ignition is so convenient and is much smoother and easier to use than our old one (when it worked!). There is a light on the handle so that when you open the lid, it shines down on your grill. The grill parts are closer together and have some areas filled it so that you are less likely to drop food in between the grill bars. It heats up evenly and has a 'O' shaped burner and a center line burner with two easy turn controls.The only problem is that to turn off the propane tank at the valve, as recommended by Weber and the practice in our house, you have to reach around the front screen which is awkward. It is designed to hide the tank but it makes it more difficult to reach.The side tables are heavy duty plastic (our old one was wood, which didn't hold up over time) and have hooks for hanging tools and grill cleaners. They also fold down if you don't have enough space for one or both to stay up.Food cooks nicely and evenly and comes off the grill pretty easy, no leaving big chunks behind."
51,868,4,"I wanted to mention first to REALLY check your packing materials, because I initially thought I was missing the chains, until I located them wrapped in paper under the pot.Anyway -- this hanging basket is currently swinging on my front porch, and overall I'm very pleased with it.  The metal basket is very high quality -- really nicely made, and feels as thought it'll last for many seasons outside.  It is shiny and well finished -- painted for rust resistance (most baskets like this are not, and will last you one or two seasons).The chains are very nice quality as well, and match the painted finish of the basket.  The hook at the juncture of the chains is heavy and substantial, and is shaped nicely -- open enough to fit over any shape hook or through any eye you have, and bent in a way that should keep it fairly secure (sometimes hanging baskets have a poorly designed top hook that easily slips off, but this one is large enough that it should stay put, at least when the basket is loaded with dirt).The liner itself is designed as an alternative to the fuzzy brown cocoa husk liners, which have a tendency to dry out quickly (if there's no inner liner of another material).  It fits the bill -- it is EXCELLENT at retaining water, unlike the cocoa husk liners -- this one, especially if filled with that ""moisture control"" potting soil, will actually stay moist for several days after watering.  I have never had a hanging basket retain moisture as well as this, except for plastic ones.  I assume this is why it is called an ""eco"" liner -- because you'll use less water and no plastic(?)  (Because obviously cocoa husks are sustainable and bio-degradable -- they just dry out quickly.)  Plastic, besides the whole non-eco thing, gets TOO wet in rainy weather -- this one is a very good balance.The only drawback I can find is that it's just not as attractive as a real cocoa husk liner -- it looks a bit like a cardboard box, or those recycled paper packing forms that come around fragile products!  I think next year I will buy a bit of cocoa husk (they sell extra husks at the garden center) and add some to the basket for ""camouflage"" between the basket and this liner (assuming it holds up for a second year, which it seems like it might).All in all, a very nice product that should hold up for years.  I would recommend it, and I'd definitely buy a product with this liner (I'd just disguise it with a bit of actual cocoa husk for vanity!)"

Works great when it works; but sadly it doesn't work reliably and parts are not available.  Do not buy this chipper!KUDO's to Amazon, when I emailed them about this problem, even though I was out of the 30 day return window, I immediately got an email authorizing free UPS return and a refund.

325,704,5,"I generally as a rule avoid Camco hoses.  The inexpensive white hoses that I have purchased at department stores just don't hold up.  I live full-time in my RV and it is a pain to deal with leaky hose fittings.I was glad to find this quality hose, made by Camco.  The hose material is durable and the fittings are strong and reliable.We just had to endure some sub zero temperatures.  I applied heat tape to the hose in a rush job to keep things from freezing.  The hose did great and did not give off a bad taste like so many others do when they have heat tape on them.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this hose again."

329,788,4,"The Perky-Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder is easy to assemble and use.Pros:  Attractive.Holds five pounds of seed.Has four easy-to-grip 'U' shaped feeding stations.Sliding lock on cap keeps 'varmints' out.Fairly wind and rain proof.The clear sides make it possible to see the seed levels.Cons:  The sides are plastic.  Heavy glass panels would have been both squirrel proof and would have withstood the sun better.  The plastic sides lower the value and lasting quality of the feeder.We live on a hill top in Tennessee where the wind-driven rains can be pounding and raccoons raid our bird feeders at will.  So far the Perky-Pet feeder has stood up to the challenges of keeping the seed dry and fairly safe from non-bird predators.  But I'm sure that come winter, a hungry critter is going to eat through that plastic and dine on the birds' seeds.  I wouldn't mind that, but it will make the feeder useless.The bottom line: An attractive commodious feeder best used in an area safe from predators and the sun.  For other locations, think twice."
635,757,5,I bought this to use with my new water sprinkler. It doesn't leak at all. Took only 5 seconds to install. So easy to use. Works great. Love that it doesn't need batteries.

531,924,5,"My husband and I are blessed: we not only have a wee country cottage that we call our home but also a tiny studio condo in the City, to cut down on commuting 180 miles,  round trip for business and pleasure purposes. And one of the things we've learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be ""scaled down"" in size, for Urban Use, whether it's a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don't have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That's why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that's indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who's ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it's sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it's so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it's small size is perfect for filling every other day.We've had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other's, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we're attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We're lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We've also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It's definitely a ""niche"" category; I wouldn't use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there's too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it! And we enjoy being able to have our morning tea at the window, enjoying Nature, up close. :D"
1339,272,5,"I'm not the only one who likes this bird feeder.......the birds do too!  It is very well made..no plastic or wood, all steel.  It will last forever.  I love wildlife, especially wild birds and I have many bird feeders.  This one is a great addition to my backyard.  Attractive, durable & the birds love it!  Can't ask for more than that."
1355,807,3,"Only the best designed HVAC systems provide a good flow of conditioned air to the rooms that need it the most.This device allows a retrofit when you have access to the ducts that have an exposed 6 inch diameter round duct.Mrs. Gearhead thinks it a little noisey, but I did not find it objectionable.There are a few changes I would make to the design. The 6 foot ac cord required that I install an electrical circuit to feed power to the elecric motor in this ""booster"". And then the there is the problem of activating the motor only when it was needed. To automate this, you need a relay to attach to the furnace blower motor so that this booster only runs when the blower is moving air. An experienced HVAC installer can do this, but then he could also trim the other ducts so theis auxilliary booster is not needed.So, it is no silver bullet to the average homeowner."

1375,268,5,"The Good:  I use this to cover my Weber Spirit 3 burner grill and couldn't be happier.  After years of using the black cover that came with the grill, it had finally torn and disintegrated to the point where it was useless.  I bought this cover after reading review and I am very impressed.  The build quality is very high and the material feel like a professional expensive canvas as compared to the plastic feel of the stock cover.  It is truly waterproof, as opposed to the stock cover which always had condensation under it.  The size is perfect for my grill model and it has nice handles to aid in taking off and putting back on.  Overall, I highly recommend it, even if you don't need a cover right now.  Just the lack of condensation alone is worth it to me to buy since it will prolong the life of your grill.The Bad:  Nothing!"
12,874,4,"This is a great product and seems fool proof.  However you still need to tend to the garden and make sure you water enough.  They come in little pods and you just stick them into the soil in your garden.  They were fun to plant and grow but you get so little food out of this pack and it is expensive.  I only planted some herbs, and it is too hot and sunny in my zone to plant others.  Most of the vegetables listed take about 60 days to grow, according to the booklet.The packaging it came in and the packet to teach you how to use them are great.  If you have a big garden, economically you will want to buy seeds as you will get more for your money.  However, for convenience, these make a good choice. It's a good choice for those who want a smaller vegetable garden and just starting out."
118,775,3,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:Months have gone by, and writing Landmann customer service has gotten me nowhere regarding the damaged smoker I received.  By contrast, I have worked with Weber customer service in the past for issues related to their smoker, and found them to be quick to respond, and quick to solve the problems I had.This Landmann has been used to cook salmon, ribs, and more.  It does a nice job.  Being able to control the temperature with such precision is a major benefit of this smoker over my Weber Smokey Mountain charcoal-based smoker.  There IS convenience in an electric smoker in terms of setup and temperature control.  However, I find that cleaning the charcoal smoker is easier (perhaps because it can lifted, dumped, rinsed with a hose, and so on).  I also personally prefer the taste of charcoal-smoked food over this electric cooker.  The taste of charcoal-smoked seems more ""authentic"", whether I use lump hardwood or the standard blue bag of Kingsford charcoal (stay away from using lighter fluid!).So, despite the damage to this Landmann, it's fine.  My Weber will continue to be my go-to smoker.  But, when I want to be able to smoke something on a moment's notice, the minimal work in setting up the Landmann makes it a nice convenience.  I have updated my review from 2 stars to 3 because the damage the unit suffered (in manufacturing or in shipping) does not seem to have affected its performance.HERE'S MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:A damaged unit, poor customer service, and some incovenient operating requirements have killed my initial enthusiasm for an electric smoker.I have been using a Weber Smokey Mountain charcoal smoker for several years now, and love it...I've done ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and whole chickens, and have always been happy with the results.  I got this Landmann electric smoker as a second smoker...not as a replacement.  I am quite fond of my charcoal smoker, but the cleanup after each cook is kind of tedious.  I figured that an electric smoker would bring a little convenience for the times when I don't want to deal with charcoal.For a moment, let's set aside the fact that the smoker arrived damage.  Even without that issue, there are issues that make this much less convenient than my charcoal smoker:1) The cord is roughly 3 feet long.  The instructions explicitly state that an extension cord should not be used (more specifically, it says that the cooking temperature might decrease as a result of using an extension cord).  This means that I have to use the smoker within 3 feet of the electrical outlet on my deck.  However...2) The unit is not supposed to be exposed to rain.  I understand this: it's an electric smoker.  Surely it makes sense not to get it wet.  However, my Weber charcoal smoker sits outside all the time (covered when not in use).  And, it's safe to get the Weber wet, even when cooking.3) Since the unit is not supposed to get wet, I need to put it away when not in use (I don't have a cover yet, but may get one).  The problem is that the thing weighs around 80 pounds.  It is NOT easy to get up and down steps.  It's really a two-person job.  But because my only outlet is on that deck, and because I can't let the smoker get wet, I need to get it up and down my deck steps every time I want to use it.Now, back to the damage: The unit arrived with a noticeable dent near the rear...a dent big enough that it actually affected another piece of metal that connects to it.  Also, one of the included shelves had a broken piece of metal on it, like it was never actually attached to the shelf on one end.  Looking at other reviews, apparently I'm not alone as far as the dents are concerned.  Several other reviewers have the same issue.  The packaging for the smoker seemed perfectly fine, so I suspect that the dent is something that's happening during manufacturing/assembling...not in transit.Finally, there's the customer service: I wrote Landmann right away about the damage to the smoker.  Many days have gone by, and I have yet to hear back from Landmann.  Given the fairly high cost of this smoker, it would be nice to know that there is some kind of user support to go with the smoker.  But so far, nothing.A true review of the smoker ought to include a review of the quality of the food it produces.  However, I wanted to give a heads up about some of the problems you might encounter.  Once I do my first smoke, I will update this review.  (I did run it once with smoke wood, but no meat...something that's part of the initial setup.  That went smoothly.)  Similarly, I will update this review if Landmann customer service ever actually follows up with me.For now, though, it's really hard to recommend this smoker.  It's bound to be a frustrating experience."
598,950,5,"This product was a sturdy, handsome spatula that was easy touse and looked great.  The long handle enabled me to stand at adistance and the turner was easy to use and to manipulate.  I wouldpurchase this item as an extra for my beach home - or be happy togive it as a hostess gift when going to a party or barbeque...I receivedthis item free in exchange for a review."
1034,945,4,"I purchased this unit for my small FL farm.  Recently I fired what will probably be the last of the gardeners I ever hire (welcome to SoFL and lazy lawncare help).  I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn't give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.  Nonetheless, the area I needed to clean up is done for another week and took me little time to whip into shape with this machine.  I will probably buy one more battery and another charger should battery life not improve on this 2d charging round."
265,524,4,"I was eventually able to get this set up and working as it is supposed to. I do have hummingbirds and they did come and feed from it, so I can say that it does work as intended. It looks interesting and people almost always ask what it is. If there was a way to stop ants from invading it, that would be great (not sure if they deter the hummingbirds). Now, since I received this as a Vine product to review, I am going to assume what they are shipping to customers comes with nicer packaging and instructions, because the one I got was just thrown in a shipping box with no instructions or anything. I had to go online to read instructions. However, even after reading the written instructions online, I have to admit I could not figure out how to activate the feeder. It was not intuitive that you need to pull the clear plastic bottle assembly up from the flower base to get the liquid to flow to the flower feeders. I only figured it out after seeing one of their videos."
434,433,4,"I love the look of this bird feeder and waterer!  It looks great hanging outside my kitchen window.  It would absolutely be a 5 star review, except that the waterer is so close to the feeder, that birds scatter the birdseed into the water tray, and then the seeds start sprouting up inside the water holder, making weekly cleaning necessary.  I might try to modify this thing so that it has 2 seed containers instead of one of each, which appears to be possible."
1561,24,5,"My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings, clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer, 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge, turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business, so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!"

510,142,4,"I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great.  Why? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep.  (this may sound silly to us, but it is true).  I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now.  You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter.  The batteries last many months.  Honestly, the price is a little steep for what it is, but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds.  It should last many seasons with proper care."
1335,216,5,"It works. You will be able to see a difference in your veggie plants. Make sure to mix it into the soil, do not top dress. My garden loved it. Will be using it again. If it is unavailable i nyour area check on glacial rock dust out of the US good old northern neighbor Eh!"
711,617,5,"I used it once and it has killed everything I sprayed within three days, I would highly recommend this product. And it being concentrated it should last me a long time."
135,145,5,the birds love it!  got this for my husband to watch the cardinals and after just a few weeks we have to refill...and none of it because of squirrells.  it's a nice size so we don't have to change it every day.
1230,482,5,"I'm one of the unfortunate people that mosquitoes love. No matter where I go, I am always the first to get bitten. My bites can swell up to the size of a quarter, and particularly bad ones can itch for a week, so it is with great relief that I discovered Repel last summer.I am happy to report that this is very effective for a mosquito lightning rod like me and against such a vicious enemy as the Asian tiger mosquitoes in my area. They've out-competed the brown mosquitoes we used to have, which only bite during the morning and dusk/evening and are quite docile by comparison. Asian tigers are active all day and night and very efficient at finding their prey. They're quicker, meaner, and more prolific. Stepping into the garden without my Repel means 6-8 bites within minutes. Unlike browns, the bites of Asian tigers also hurt.Ease of use:------------The pump is very easy to use. It creates a fine mist that can be rubbed in to distribute. The mist gives your skin a bit of a sheen, since it contains oils. The smell is pleasant, though you may wish to hold your breath while spraying, in order to prevent accidental inhalation. You may need to apply generously, depending on your level of mosquito attraction.Environmental and Safety Considerations:----------------------------------------The active ingredient p-Menthane-3,8-diol is made from eucalyptus leaves, so you can feel easier about using it. I also bought OFF! Deep Woods Long Lasting Insect Repellents along with this product, but was concerned about DEET getting absorbed into my skin. Repel, on the other hand, is plant-based and much safer to use as well as environmentally more responsible. p-Menthane-3,8-diol poses no risk to humans or animals, according to the EPA, so you don't have to worry about poisoning if you have children or pets."
740,498,5,Great Smoker/Cooker. It is plenty large enough to cook acouple of briskets or chickens or several racks of ribs. I smoked a Turkey a in it with no problem. Once I got the temperature where I wanted it it stayed very stable for 6 hours. I definitely recommend this smoker
873,95,5,"This is a really easy to assemble box that is just right for my gardening supplies. We have it on the front balcony of our floating home. It looks just fine and doesn't detract from the look of the front of our house, which is in a high traffic tourist area so we try to keep it looking nice. So far it's been rain proof and has worked out really well. I recommend it for anyone needing a bit of storage in a smaller outdoor space."
501,858,5,"I know I should regularly change the oil in my lawn mower and pressure washer, but it always seems to fall off of the to-do list. This all-in-one kit is an easy way to get the job done.In addition to a quart of SAE 30 oil it has a bottle of fuel stabilizer to keep gas from gumming up the carb, a spark plug, and an air cleaner filter replacement. Basically all the parts needed to keep a small gas engine working well.It's packaged in a two-part plastic case that serves as both a funnel for the oil, plus a container to store the used oil to bring it to a recycling center.The kit is more expensive than buying all the components separately, but having everything at hand all at once, plus having a bin to store the used oil makes this a worthwhile purchase. Highly recommend."
151,144,5,This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.
1138,736,5,"My lime tree was very sad looking this winter before we got a few lights for it.  We have this and one for flowering.  It's perked up well with the combination.  I did notice that when I use the flowering exclusively, it really puts the plant in a flowering cycle.  When I use it in combination with this full spectrum, the flowering stops.  I'm hoping it will help the tree grow back the massive amounts of leaves it lost at the beginning of winter.  So far, it's succeeded in keeping it from loosing what was left, at least as fast."
1419,305,5,"I was pretty skeptical, I will admit.  I used this in my houseplants because somewhere along the way I got house gnats / fungus gnats.  My biggest issue is they would swarm my Kindle at night when I'm trying to read!  But they were also just piles of them by the windows where they tried to fly away, I guess?So I mixed it up according to the directions (not the spray directions, the other directions where you mix it into the soil with water).  It's about 2 weeks later and I haven't seen any in a few days now and if there are any left, there has been a near-extinction event for them!  I was pretty skeptical whether or not this would work, especially inside houseplants, but I'll say it did a great job.  I'm a little concerned about what the little buggers are going to eat now though, if they've run out of food!It seems to have worked in my carnivorous plants sitting in wet spaghum moss, cactus sand/soil, peat, and various mixtures of soils.  It even worked in the plants that use a bark mix, like my orchids.  I think my collection of sundews might miss all the meals they were getting, but we'll manage somehow.  :-)"
1091,131,4,"These suet cakes are great for those that have a bird feeder with the square holders on them.  All types of bird love these, including cardinals, blue jays, wrens and others.  They also last for a while as week..usually a week for us as they have lots of visitors eating them."
714,929,5,"These KUISIWARE HEAT RESISTANT GLOVES provide the complete, flexible protection that my hands need when I'm baking or broiling at very high oven temperatures.  When I use hot pads, I sometimes get burns from oven racks as I'm taking something out of the oven; when I use thick oven mitts, I don't have good control for handling pie dishes, muffin pans, or anything else with semi-liquid contents.These heat-resistant gloves made of knitted fabric allow me to use all five fingers (like thick knitted winter gloves) to handle pans or dishes.  The red silicone bands atop the fabric have the feel of rubber, and grip firmly (like rubber).  I can't vouch for the heat resistance up to 662 degrees F., but I do know that the gloves work well when I bake bread in a 465-degree oven, or broil in a 550-degree oven.A nice feature is that one size fits all.  The gloves are a fairly snug fit for my large hands (men's size small), but they seem to have enough remaining stretch to accommodate even larger hands.  The gloves have the same silicone bands on both sides--thus either glove will fit either hand.  There's never any need to locate the ""left"" or ""right"" glove if you're in a hurry.  The gloves are machine washable, but should be laid out flat to air dry.The accompanying literature includes the following warning:  ""Do not use the glove when wet.  It loses its heat-resistant properties.  Do not use on oily, greasy or wet surfaces.  Do not expose the glove to open fire.  Even though the aramid fibers protect the glove from catching on fire, to prong its life and prevent any accidents, keep it away from fire.  Do not let small children use the glove to play with fire.""Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.  I have no financial interest or business relationship with the manufacturer or seller, and this review represents my independent opinion of the product."
1438,258,5,"This is an excellent, QUIET tool for yard clean-up and pruning. designed for branches in the 1 1/2"" - 2 range, also good on 3"" and 4""ers.  Advertised as capable of 150 1-1/2"" cuts on a charge--and I believe it!--Have cut up to 6"" logs with no problem, although that does drain the battery quickly. A 6""er is, by volume, the equivalent of at least 16 1-1/2"" cuts, and with the extra drag of cutting across a 6""inch face, is probably more like 32 cuts. Use this tool for what it's designed for, and it won't disappoint! Why is that negative reviewer talking about cutting 2x4s? that's what your circular saw is four! do you also drive nails with your screwdriver?PRO:  Lightweight, no noise, no stink, no fuel!CON:  it does leak oil. minor irritation."
652,861,5,"This set of tools comes with a Pruner and a Shear/ Trimmer, both are cordless and rechargeable. And while they are great for any gardener, I would say they are a must have for an elderly gardener who just doesn't have the strength or endurance to use regular tools. All of the tools come with sheaths to protect the blades (and you) from harm.Now lets look at each tool, one at a time;The Pruner can cut up to 1/2 inch green and about 1/3 inch dead wood. It can also cut larger pieces in multiple cuts. It has a very long run time, almost an hour and it recharges very fast. I took an hour lunch and it was done recharging before I was. Another nice touch are two LED lights. Sometimes when I am shaping up a large hedge, I have to crawl under it to get the back side away from the wall. These light make it easier to work underneath. And of course they also work as an emergency flashlight.The Shear/Trimmer is a single tool with exchangeable heads. The shear is great for cutting grasses, especially good for trimming back ornamental grasses. But it may be best suited for dead-heading flowering bushes and perennials like roses. Cutting off the dying blooms will extend the blooming time of most flowers. Now the Hedge Trimmer is too small to trim your entire hedge, but it is perfect for keeping it trimmed afterwards. It is also good for getting the grass and weeds underneath it where your mower and trimmer can't reach without damaging the hedge.Overall these are magnificent tools for any gardener to have."
468,523,5,"As they say: ""So far, so good"". . . it might be a little early to be 'rating' this, as every other hose nozzle I have bought in the last two years has malfunctioned (leaked, quit) even though I liked them to start with. I bought this because, while it did have a couple of bad ratings, the preponderance of ratings were high. Time will tell. I DO like the fact that it has several more 'settings' than others I have owned."
447,283,5,"I LOVE to cook and have a pantry that looks like a grocery store, so when these little moth invaders come unvited into my flour and chocolate products (yes~they attack CHOCOLATE!) I become unhinged!Safer Pantry Pest Traps are all you need to fix this problem. Open a packet, which contains a little pheremone patch, toss it inside the prefolded trap and place in your pantry. That's it. In a matter of hours, you will have the little pests fly into the sticky trap and soon, the males and females cannot mate, and your mothy guests are history.I recommended these traps to two friends who also used them, and had successful results too, so I HIGHLY recommend them if you are unfortunate enough to have pantry moths. Two thumbs up!!"
293,874,3,"This seemed like and interesting concept so I thought I would give it a try.  Here is what I liked about the product:1.  Each herb and vegetable start is in its own individual peat like container with soil, fertilizer, and seed already inside.  As well, each peat planter is sealed to keep the contents inside until you are ready to plant it.2.  Each Seed container is clearly labeled.3.  Clear planting instructions and a paper type ruler is included to help you plant your garden correctly.4.  Extra fertilizer is included.5.  The entire seed collection is sealed in aluminum type foil.Here is what I did not like:1.  No geographical region consideration is used in putting together this collection;  So, depending upon where you live this may work or it may not.  Most probably, you will get results inbetween (some things will work and some will not.2.  No specific variety is labeled so you have no idea what you really planted.  The reason this is important?  If you found some items you liked, how will you go out and just buy the starts or the seed for that next year?3.  There is no dating on the package that I could find.  Why is this important?  Well, seeds have a germination life and if your package was intended for 2011 and you are receiving it now, you stand a better than average chance that your seeds will not germinate and you will not know why.4.  This is a very expensive way to obtain starts or seeds.  As well, if you follow directions and eliminate any starts other than the strongest in each peat planter, you will not have enough to make this really worth while.  However, this would make a good mix to start off a young gardener to see what each plant is like.  They will probably not care that it does not produce enough to feed the family, they will just care that it worked and that they can eat what they grew.5.  Most of the plants are intended to be planted in early spring.  So, having this available  in July makes no sense at all since you probably will not have enough time in the northern states for a lot of this to grow and the cool weather crops, while they can be planted in the fall, will probably not do as well.All in all, if this was made available at the correct time of year and if your intention was to provide a learning experience, this could make a good product.  Because there are no limitations to when it is shipped and you have no idea how old the seeds really are, I would not recommend it at this time."
1240,43,4,"I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual. The blades on these are great! Small branches and more cut easily, quickly and cleanly. They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $7 sheers I've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately. They have a life time warranty, but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials."
576,663,5,Great fit for my Spirit grill. Easy on and easy off. Just like the grill the cover is well made. Good price onAmazon vs stores.
897,303,2,"I have been using a bag-type skimmer ever since we got the in-ground pool.  I thought this style would be handier; I could scoop up some leaves, swing around, and deposit them outside the pool area.  Not so.  The skimmer doesn't capture many leaves, or anything else, at all.  Maybe I don't really know how to use it correctly, but it doesn't work for me."
758,610,5,"I purchased this for my husband, who has back problems and he enjoys it very much.  It is very comfortable on our deck.  Folds up quite small and is easy to store."
248,654,4,"Perfect for starting your plants just be careful how you handle it because it easily cracks but nothing that will cause the dome not to work, it's a good investment for the price."
956,805,5,"For rodents I rely on snap traps.  I once tried a glue trap like this for a mouse and was horrified - did you know mice can scream?  So I don't use these glue traps in areas of rodent activity.  That being said, I get a ton of camel crickets in my basement along with hunting spiders (like wolf spiders and jumping spiders).  I place these glue boards along baseboards and behind furniture.  At the end of the month, they are covered in dead crickets and spiders.  They are excellent, especially if you have kids in the home and don't want to spray tons of chemicals.  The only downside is that they are very sticky and have open tops.  In high-traffic kid areas, I use the tri-fold cardboard because if your kid gets stuck on this trap, cleanup is not fun.I had previously used the black traps, but these new high-contrast traps are great because I can actually see what I caught a lot better.  Especially when trying to identify a spider, it's nice to have the white background and green goo.Highly recommended so long as you aren't trying to nab a rodent."
799,504,5,All I can say is wow. We keep a clean home and suddenly noticed some mouse dropping and could not figure out where they were coming from. We unpacked this compact little case.. followed the instructions and the next day had 5 mice in it. Was easy to clean and certainly lead to us resting more comfortably not wondering if uninvited guests were wandering around our home. Worth every cent.
333,79,5,"This weedeater is light and cheap and meant to do one thing:  edge lawns.  If you're looking for a device to do a finishing touch on your lawn, this is a smart approach.  Sadly, most of us lack the discipline to use such specialized tools for their best purpose, so don't get adventurous and simply finish off your lawnwork with the craftsman's tool for lawns."
826,53,5,"Great and effective product for YJ's only. No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies, but this is great for YJ's. Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates."
82,648,1,"I purchased this weeder based on the excellent reviews, but I had a totally different experience with this product.  I used this tool for about 1 hr straight today.  Mostly I was weeding dandelions (this weeder really looks to be a take on the traditional dandelion digger, so I thought it would work well).  But I also used it to weed various other types of weeds throughout the yard and garden.As other reviewers have pointed out, the tool does have very sharp points and is built to last - nice, heavy, one-piece polished aluminum construction and nice quality handle.  However, I was very disappointed in the functionality of this tool, mainly because of the design of the functional weeding tip.  The widest opening at tip (top width of the V) is only 3/8"" (actually slightly less than 3/8"") and it is a very narrow V (the vertical cutting part of the V is 3/4"").  It just did not work for big dandelions - the root of big dandelions is just too large to fit nicely into the cutting area, even if when I used force to try to cut off large roots, it did not work well. I think this is also because the inside cutting edges of the V are very dull, so it does not cut roots well.  Also, the V is very narrow and thick and gets clogged with dirt easily.  Another point about the design is that the lever is at a very flat, awkward angle and does not work well for ""popping"" weeds.  I did try different angles and positions of the Fiskars weeder and it just did not work for me.  It seemed to take so much effort to use.The only minor success that I had was in very soft soil in a mulched garden bed, but definitely worse than the standard dandelion digger.  It also worked okay for digging under clover on bare soil.  I cannot imagine using this tool in thick grass or hard dirt.  Definitely do not recommend.  I will try sharpening my traditional dandelion digger tip and continue using it."
775,302,4,"I have not used as much as I thought because I don't have as many leave as I thought I would. But, it is a sturdy good product. After i purchased the &#34;Water Tech Pool Blaster Max&#34; it's hard to go back to manual..."

You can hange the position to use it for edgingIt comes with a 30 day risk free trial and a 2 year warranty.I've found it to be much easier to use and quicker than prior models. Also, I've found that it makes getting the job done much more comfortable due to it's light weight."
1062,665,5,"After a couple of minor adjustments, the trap now works like a charm: The peanut butter, mixed with bird-food containing sunflower seeds, appears to be irresistible to chipmunks and gray squirrels. Although the trap has two doors, the trap seems to be most effective when used in the one-door mode; then the critter has to go OVER the trip plate to get to the bait.  No free lunch in that case.  The design and the efficiency of this trap are just amazing.My trap was not quite square when I took it out of the box.  As a result, the trap door rubbed against one side.  But is was a simple task to bend the cage back into the proper square shape.  Another minor problem was that the trap would not stay open.  Filing the plastic setting handle where it touches the top of the trap when it is pulled open solved that problem.  I wonder, are these traps tested before they are shipped or did the damage occur during shipment?  In any event, it is a good idea to verify that the trap works properly when putting it into service and to make any needed minor adjustments."
1058,198,5,"COULD THIS BE THE BEST LEAF RAKE EVER?Bought mine at LOWES a couple of years ago to replace another plastic-tined rake which I had been very pleased with. Was astounded at the comfort and effectiveness of the Fiskars rake vs. my old rake whose tines had been worn off. Loaned it to a neighbor - a recent college grad from one of the area's big engineering schools - very shortly later he had his own Fiskars!Living in a veritable Druid's grove of various Quercus species, some of them with thin LIVE OAK type leaves, I have found this rake to be capable of gathering most of those with one pass.Fiskars promotes this rake with the slogan:LESS WORK; MORE WEEKENDBelieve it. [and thanks Fiskars engineers for a super product!]TECHNICAL HI-LITES1. TINES: are VERY sturdy and durable but you will need your garden rake to move big and/or damp piles of leaves2. HANDLE: long enough for taller people but fine for shorter ones. The egg-shaped cross section allows much weight reduction yet provides great strength and it provides a level of comfort and fatigue-resistance that has to be experienced to be believed.Disclaimer: Other than using their products I have absolutely no ties to Fiskars."
1469,821,5,"This handy dandy little mouse trap is a 3-holer.  You can catch three mice at once. You can reuse it too, or for the faint of heart, you can just discard it when it has occupants.  This is perfect for us.  We have a rodent loving cat in the house, but she does not have access to the garage and that is where we have rodent visitors.  So we set traps in the garage. You can't help but love the fact that it can catch 3 at once and there is no poison involved, just good old fashioned mousetrap technology."
123,902,5,"We live in an area with exceptionally high water bills and ample rain so water barrels are a 'no brainer'. Unfortunately, living in the suburbs also means appearance matters almost (maybe more than) function. In the past, we've purchased the Algreen rain barrels that look like big terra cotta jugs and have been happy with them more or less (B0013CJLI6 ATIN number). However, one one can never have too many rain barrels so when this came up for review, I jumped at the opportunity.PackagingThis arrived promptly and well packaged without any dings or dents. My original Algreen order had a big dent which I managed to get 'unkinked&#34; but suffice to say, this held up better. It is a big box and very cumbersome so keep this in mind especially if mobility or other related considerations are an issue.Quality of ConstructionI'd have to rate the quality of construction 'excellent'. It is molded but very thick...much more so than the Algreen 50 gal rain barrels. The planter does not have drainage which is a bit odd. The screen is thick and built-in so more stable. There is a breathing hole and two well placed spigots made out of brass. You will need to install the spigots (2 of them...tape is included to form a tight seal). These are attractive and made out of metal which looks better than the plastic but only time will tell if they hold up to rust/corrosion. There is a notable seam and for some reason, one of the spigot holes is placed adjacent to the seam making it difficult to position when attempting to hide the seam. Compared to the Algreen 50 gal barrels, this feels more substantial and of an overall better quality. Note, it does not come with a drainage hose so plan accordingly.AppearanceThis is an attractive, very neutral color, rain barrel. The picture doesn't show it as well but the entire outside is covered in a type of 'wave' pattern which I think will likely collect dirt more readily than a flat/smooth surface. The lighter color is also more likely to show it than the terra cotta Algreen barrel. All in all, this is attractive but not as attractive as the Algreen. However, it will be easy to wash off and appearance is truly in the eye of the beholder.StabilityAs you can see from the product photo, the bottom is smaller than the top although not by a lot. We set this up on a few paver/walking stones for added stability...more than ample. This is VERY heavy when filled with water so taking the time to reinforce it before allowing it to be filled is prudent.What You Will Need- Stable place for placement. When filled with water this will weigh well over 400 lbs so shifting sand/other could become a problem. We use a couple of large walking stones/pavers for support which is more than ample.- Hose. This does not come with a hose. We use remnants purchased here on Amazon.- Downspout drainage. This is designed for use with a downspout which fits over the built-in (but removable) grill screen."
1262,4,5,"Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment."
1504,190,5,"We have gone through several products similar to this and always ended up with something that broke, leaked or otherwise didn't function very well.  We purchased several of these and put them on hoses throughout the yard.  All of them have been working great.  We have found needs for all 9 spray patterns."
1018,41,5,"I had a cable driven long pruner, and besides the fact that it ... near broke my hand to clip a large branch with it, the thing was fragile.  I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw. If you've got a little pruning to do, get this Pruning Stik and start clipping away."
94,167,4,"I live in a pretty suburban area yet we are frequented by rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, possums, and even deer.  My backyard is surrounded by a 6'6"" wooden fence so we only get the smaller animals back there where I have my vegetable garden.  However, the front yard is open to larger creatures (including the deer) that like to munch on my flowers and bushes.  My garden is protected by theHavahart Motion Detector Sprinklerand a few other deterrents but my front yard was undefended until now.When I got a chance to try the Havahart Deer Off II I hoped that it would cut down on the bigger critters eating my landscaping.  I am an animal lover so I don't want to hurt them, I just wanted them to go back to more wooded areas.  I sprayed my ground-cover, the flowers and the shrubs that could be reached by deer.  The spray was fairly stinky when it was being applied, but not overly so.  The battery power was nice but I would rather have a pump version so I could increase the pressure of the spray to suit my pace of spraying.Once applied I kept checking to see if I had new growth on previously chewed-up plants.  The result was mixed.  The taller greenery seemed have been protected but something is still eating my flowers.  We are experiencing a drought here in San Antonio and it just could be that the animals will ignore the bad taste when they are starving.  Still, it is an improvement.  I like that the mix is all natural and it seems to be reasonably priced.  I will be buying more of this in the future."
691,792,5,"The Perky Pet Waterer for birds is a genius of an idea. It is light weight and easy to fill and keep filled. I have tried to put water out for the birds, but the pan always gets leaves and dirt in it immediately. This waterer is perfect for small birds. They can perch on the edge and the water is right there for them. I love it."

737,893,5,"I choose Fiskars brand a lot when I have the choice.  I've chosen their rakes, scissors, loppers and paper cutters.  This Quantum Hand Lopper is replacing a Lopper I had that a neighbor ""permanently borrowed"" :)Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper- my fault for lending because they are so amazing that there are always more projects to do with them.  My other Loppers were over 8 years old and holding strong .... but they have found a new home.That said, I decided to try the Cadillac of Loppers!  That would be these, the Quantum Hand Lopper by Fiskars.  This one is different.  It's different with it's cork coated handle that absorbs some of the shock and it's light materials.  The mechanism is flawless and it cuts branches and small trees (2"" max) like butter.  The leverage these type of loppers provide is amazing.  The handle takes some of the shock out of the last phase of each cut.  These really are a lighter option too ... and that makes for an easier lopping experience when you are doing it for several cuts.These are superb and you are going to pay for that.  If you take your pruning seriously and need the best tool to lop, buy these.  They are nearly 4X more expensive than others but you do get what you pay for.  Made in Finland with lighter materials and patented gearing technology that multiplies your effort.Fantastic!"
1251,711,4,"I love our chickens and probably spoil them with treats too much, but watching a chicken come wings flapping, wildly galloping for treats is one of the most hilarious things one could witness. Oh man do they love these! They practically inhale them before they hit the ground! I didn't think 7 ounces of mealworms would be all that much before I ordered but it actually much more than you might expect. Now that I know they without doubt love them I will have to pick up a larger bag next time. These are of course a much better value than the one advertised exclusively for chickens(wont mention names)and they are both still manufacted in China. That's a big downside, but no surprise:( Hence the missing star."
0,777,5,"This feeder is one of the nicer and more attractive ones that I have received that came from China. I feel lucky to have been able to get this from the Vine program. It fits in well with the four more that I just purchased for my growing collection. There was no user guide or sheet with this feeder. However, it was a simple matter to discover the button on the top of the feeder. Pushing this button allowed the top to slide along the hanging wire so that the feeder could be filled with one or two different kinds of bird feed. I filled both compartments with black sunflower seed. However, it would be very easy to fill one of the compartments with a different bird food since both compartments are filled from the top. If squirrels have access to your feeders then this is probably not the best choice. All 14 of my feeders hang from poles that have been squirrel proofed. The birds wasted no time landing on this feeder and from the way they are licking their chops they are having a great time."
1307,810,4,We have a big garden and keeping moles away can be a big problem. Unfortunately we've also had a very rainy spring here in New England and that cuts back on how effective this stuff is as the rain washes this away. But so far over the last week it seems to be helping keep our plants safe.I am concerned that it's been discontinued by the manufacturer I hope it doesn't kill my lawn. I am a little bit concerned as I'm not sure why it was discontinued. Time will tell if my lawn and garden dies I'm good to be a little bit upset.Thanks for reading!
373,553,4,"Hard to get super excited over a product that seems to do what it advertises to do.  Bugs die.  Diseases and fungi disappear.  That's what it is designed to do and it does it.  So does almost every product like this one.  If their claims are correct, it is nice to know there are less chemicals and poisons in this product, yet it is still effective.  So, for a ""semi-green"" shotgun for garden ailments...this one fits the bill."
1232,730,3,"This is not the best string trimmer I've ever used, but it's not the worst ever, either. It falls somewhere between my go toToro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edgerwith Walk-Behind Edging and theBlack & Decker GH710 GrassHog 14-Inch 6.0-Amp Dual-Line Trimmerthat I got completely frustrated with and took back to Lowe's. I have to say, though, this Remington is definitely the heaviest string trimmer I have tried. I don't know if it's because of the powerful motor or sturdier materials, but this thing weighs a ton. And despite the adjustable handle, at its longest it is too short for me (I'm 5'11"") and causes significant back strain. It also adjusts head angle and switches over to an edger, but the kludge-y design requires physically moving and adjusting the handle when changing between functions. Also, there are lots of buttons for making the adjustments, so to get the most out of the trimmer - and in some cases just to operate the thing at all - you will have to read the manual. There are some pluses among all the drawbacks though.For use as an edger, they supplied a guide wheel that allows you to set the thing down on the sidewalk, so at least when edging you don't have to support the entire weight of the device. I also liked the double string head, which really tears into grass quickly, easily, and cleanly, taking everything out in just one pass. The feed mechanism is like the Toro's, where you have to stop the engine ""for two seconds"" then restart it to feed about a quarter inch of line. This works sporadically at best and requires good timing and patience. After a short while, I learned to listen for the feed ""click"" and knew I was good to continue on, but practically speaking, it's slow going when you can only go two feet or so before having to wait a few seconds (or more for multiple feeds to catch up on the correct length) before continuing with the operation. Still, with all the power supplied, when you have the line out, its quick work and as I said, does the job in one pass. I haven't had to change the line yet, but I suspect it is more or less like every other double-line string trimmer and that will be a pain as well. (No way around that, though, so no stars deducted for that.)Overall, this has some good features and some not so good features. For a stronger, shorter person, this might be just the trimmer for you. At this price point for a double-line corded trimmer, I think the cons and pros balance out and make this just an average trimmer, which is why I rate it at three stars."
1330,333,5,Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
1032,239,1,"We get mice every winter. We've tried plugging holes, sticking around peppermint and mothballs, and we have mice. We bought these traps, put peanut butter on them. The mice ate the peanut butter, the traps did not spring. They are total junk and we went back to Victor. There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off, the trigger is not sensitive."
376,933,5,"Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free NectarCategory: Backyard Birding & Wildlife&#34;The large capacity Perky-Pet &#34;Our Best&#34; Hummingbird Feeder will soon be your favorite feeder, just like it is ours! With a 30 oz. nectar capacity, this glass hummingbird feeder will assure there's always enough nectar to go around.&#34;...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar for a couple of weeks:What's not to like about this particular Hummingbird Feeder?First of all, the entire unit is very easy to disassemble and re-assemble. The built in ant moat (red top) and base (with the yellow flower-shaped feeding medallions) screw on/off with ease for cleaning and filling with nectar. The yellow flower medallions fit securely into the feeding base without wobbling or falling out.Cleaning the entire unit is a breeze, and takes very little time -- but, one will need a long bottle-brush (I think Perky-Pet sells these) to reach down into the (glass) nectar holder.The nectar reservoir is made of thick/clear glass, the screw on ant moat/holder and base are made of a very sturdy plastic. The colors are bright and cheery and will probably attract more Hummingbirds -- as opposed to more subdued colors, imo.One fills the nectar reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place.  a complimentary packet of  Perky-Pet dry nectar mix is included with this feeder. Easy to mix, and dissolved fast. Just add to 8 oz of water, stir, and pour into feeder. There is no &#34;S&#34; hook included with this feeder for hanging, but there is a place to put one built into the screw on ant moat.  The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!A really nice feature, of this particular Hummingbird feeder, is the built in bee guard. Each of the six yellow feeding medallions has a raised center to keep the bees from reaching the nectar. I am hoping it keeps the wasps and hornets away as well -- as I've seen a few sipping nectar from Hummingbird feeders, in the past, that lack this (wonderful) feature. I don't think it will keep the butterflies off, though, as they have very long tongues. *smiles*The ant moat is just a must have, if ya ask Me. Lots of Hummingbird feeders lack this important innovation. Just put plain tap water in it, after hanging the feeder, and let it do its job of keeping the ants away from the nectar, and the Hummingbirds.The feeding station is encircled by sturdy little perches for the little Hummingbirds to rest on as they feed. btw, it is a lot easier to photograph a Hummingbird that is resting on a perch. ijsThe large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio.*Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder...  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended! Would make a wonderful Gift!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014"
962,45,5,"I have owned this thing for years.  It is hands-down my all-time favorite gardening tool.  I used to use your old-school loppers which became tiring to use and had trouble cutting thick branches.  I was in Home Depot one day and decided to spend the big bucks and get this thing.  It was my first Fiskars purchase ever, and ever since then I have been SOLD on this company.  These loppers are AMAZING.  I can cut branches, even tree roots, thicker than ever before with ease.  The gears on this thing make it possible to use this for a long period of time without tiring your arms as much.  Very efficent and effective tool.  Easily my favorite most-effective gardening tool I've ever bought.  I highly recommend this to you if you are in the market for some loppers.  Or if you know someone who likes to mess around the yard (especially older folks - this is so much easier on the joints), then get this as a gift.  It's just the best!** UPDATE 12/11/2102 **I just bought this as a gift for someone this Christmas. They work outdoors around the house and actually were using these same loppers, but they were 16 years old at that point (the loppers, not the person!).  They hadn't cared for them or sharpened them and they are in really bad shape.  So - a replacement is what they're getting for Christmas!  I do still love these things!"

274,813,4,"A gorgeous set! These chairs are currently inside the house and look great. I have gotten a lot of complements on how nice they look and feel. There are a few things to note about the construction of these chairs. There are no supports under the seat area that the cushion sits on, it is only the woven wicker material. While it supported me just fine, I took the cushion off and it seemed as though if you stepped on it your foot might go through the bottom. They feel really sturdy to sit in, but I am unsure what the weight limitations might be. I had a bit of a wobble on one of the chairs, but it didn't actually wobble when anyone sits in it, only when it is empty does it wobble. The arm rests are really nice and the back is quite comfortable. I sat in one reading for over an hour without any discomfort. When the snow melts these will be on the back deck as part of the dining set. The cushions are easy to clean, we already had some chocolate milk spilled on one and it wiped up easily without leaving a stain. They are thin enough that they will dry out quickly, but thick enough for long term comfort. Overall I highly recommend this set of chairs. I think they are great and they seem durable enough to last for many years. Feel free to ask questions about them and I will answer as quickly as possible!"
171,672,5,"We own a Black & Decker cordless edger that you plug in and charge.  My husband would get 1/4 of the job done and it would go dead.  He would have to wait until the next day to do another section and so on.  Now our problem is solved.  This machine seems much more powerful too.  It is great.  It comes with two batteries and we own two other Black & Decker items (the stick chain saw and the mulcher) which have the same battery, so now we have 4 batteries.  We can do the whole block now.  Another great thing is you just recharge the battery, so you can do it in your house.  The other one we have, you had to have the whole edger plugged into a wall in the garage.  We can't say enough good things about our new GrassHog,."
121,853,4,"I have to admit to being rather disappointed when the box with my window planter first arrived. The size of the planter is 24"" long, as indicated on the packaging, but I wasn't prepared for how shallow the plant boxes would be. I seriously thought about how I might re-purpose this item before I went back to Amazon and looked at what other reviewers had written and also reviewed the product details. It was in the review of the latter that I made my decision about how to use this planter most effectively.As I have something of a black thumb, I didn't think I would be able to use this to start seedlings, and other reviewers had commented that the boxes were too shallow to allow root development. But looking closely at the packaging, I see that the manufacturer, at least for the purposes of their product picture, used the starter plants you get from the nursery and placed those directly in the boxes. Since those already have drainage holes in them, the plastic liners in these boxes can catch overflow without the necessity of drilling any extra holes. Thus, this becomes the perfect indoor herb garden--I don't have to start anything, just maintain what the nursery has already started going.And the width of the planter, when fully expanded, is very close to the width of the sink on my kitchen island. As my house is designed such that I have no kitchen windows, I've decided to leave this on the island, where the ready access to fresh herbs is most useful to me. The planter looks great now, though I have no idea whether I'll be able to keep anything growing for more than a few weeks. Any herbicidal tendencies, however, will be entirely my fault, not that of the planter, and the great thing is I can easily replace the plants at the change of the season (or upon their demise). In the end, I'm rather pleased with how cute this planter is and the fact that it's bringing some freshness indoors."
181,577,3,"These traps have been featured prominently in several commercials but I received mine before all the hype started. This trap is clearly designed to take the ""Yuck!"" factor out of the old-fashioned mouse traps. You are NOT supposed to:1. See the mouse, a good thing for the squeamish. I understand this.After a very unpleasant night when a mouse got caught in one of the older traps but didn't instantly die (the trap caught it by the body and not the head), I vowed never to use those traps again.2. It is supposed to be relatively germ-free and doesn't release a host of fleas to feed on humans (once a mouse is dead, fleas don't hang around that mouse long).  The dead mouse and fleas supposedly stay in the trap. I'm SURE the mouse does. I'm not so sure about those fleas.This item does have some SIGNIFICANT limitations. First, I did not find the instructions on the box to be intuitive or user friendly. Thank goodness Amazon had a video demonstrating how to bait, set and place the trap, allowing me to bait it correctly.To load this trap, you have to turn a lock on the top of the track, put peanut butter on the base of the lock or use a small stick or other item to add the bait to the trap. Next, put the trap in your desired location and push down on the red handle to make sure the spring sets and is ready to kill the mouse.This is when I ran into some issues. The door where the mouse is supposed to enter is very small and does effectively capture very small mice (although larger mice are reputably able to squeeze through very small holes). However, the mice in our area are considerably larger than the entrance hole in these traps and the trap only caught the smaller mice. We still had to use other traps for the far more numerous larger mice.Having noted that, the Kill and Seal trap does all it claims to do - IF it catches a mouse. More fleas and ticks (often found on mice) are kept inside the trap. The risk of getting sick from the Hanta virus or Lyme disease is lessened. You don't have to actually see the dead mouse. There is no blood or other waste to clean up. Children and pets won't accidentally get hurt by the trap and you don't have to face crying children who want to know why you killed that ""cute mouse.""The downside? There isn't any information about being able to use these traps repeatedly so they aren't as inexpensive as other traps. If you want the peace of mind from having a more hygenic mouse trap cost the price may be worth it. At this point, I've found that the trap doesn't handle larger mice - as noted above. If you lean towards eco-friendly products, these don't meet the requirements for recycling (not with the remains of dead mice inside).Overall, I don't find this the ideal mousetrap but when a mouse is caught, there is no question that fleas and ticks are also contained in the trap, not released into the air. I was very surprised by the small size of the entrance door for this trap. Consider the size of mice in your area before purchasing this. Yes, mice can squeeze into small spaces but our experience revealed some limitations when it came to this aspect of the trap."
967,761,5,"Summary - much easier to set than the Victor brand version.  Don't read any more if you're squeamish.  This is not a humane trap!We have a persistent mole problem.  This is the second plunger trap I've bought - see the picture.You use this type of trap by finding an active tunnel, then setting up a booby trap where a set of six sharp spikes on a plate comes down with great force when the mole tunnels underneath.  Mole-kebab.I have a friend who swears by this type of trap.  He has aVictor 0645 Mole Trap Plunger Styleand I purchased the same.  He had a lot of luck, but I must not have the same  Perhaps my moles are smarter.  My yard is also on a slight slop and I have a lot of sand and clay, which doesn't help.It helps for the soil to be damp when you set the trap.  You also want the plunger to stick into the ground a few times so the spikes can go into the mole and not into the ground.  This trap was MUCH easier to set, and the force of the spring is a LT stronger.  Assuming I can get a good tunnel to set it up on, I'm hoping i'll have good news to report in an update."
94,672,4,"I spend much of my time working out of my suburban home-office.  Most of my neighbors hire lawn service companies to take care of their mowing and trimming needs and every weekday I hear the whine of lawn mowers, leaf blowers, chainsaws, and weed-whackers.  I take care of my own lawn and have chosen to do it as quietly as possible.  I have aFiskars push mower, a WORX electric ""JawSaw"" and this item.I've been using the B&D; GrassHog for about a year now and I am very happy with it.  I am fairly tall (6'3"") and I found that I can adjust the handle so the I don't have to stoop while trimming.  The self adjusting nylon string whips through most of the weeds that I need to cut, but some of the plants that we have here are a little too tough and need to be cut by hand.The battery life is a little frustrating sometimes.  Even with the included spare battery I don't have enough power to do both the front and backyard at the same time (which gives me a good excuse for taking a long break while the batteries recharge.)  The edging option is nice but I wish that there was a little wheel or guide to steady it while edging.  Other than these issues I like my trimmer and use it often."

Bought this after finding rat droppings in our shed (must have made this his house after our -15 degree weather!), and within a week we successfully killed a bigger rat than I thought could exist! One word of the wise - while we didn't run into this issue, this trap closes on anything that touches it just right - and that includes dog tongues/faces. Make sure if you have this to keep it out of reach of fido or he'll have a not-so-nice surprise and you'll have an outrageous vet bill!"

It came without instructions, but it simply plugs in and oola!It is very small and compact -- it would fit in a shopping bag.I didn't particularly need an air duct ventilation system, so I found myself turning it on and experimenting with what it was able to do. I found it is capable of cooling down a medium size room, a garage, or a wet basement, or an outdoor tent in about ten to twenty minutes."
123,433,4,"This is a very attractive set that provides the ability to offer birds both seeds and water. It's simple to put together ( it takes less than 2 minutes) and can either be hung from a hook or garden stake with ease. Very versatile. I especially appreciate the ability to offer water with the seeds in order to attract birds to areas without (yet another) bird bath. Out of the box, this set appears VERY attractive however, it is plastic which appears fairly durable but has a tendency to scratch and dull over time. Additionally, I'm a bit torn about offering wild birds a plastic based feed/drinking source given the associated health hazards. The metal bracket - also attractive - is not heavily coated so I have doubts as to the long term viabilty of the feeder as well as the environmental impact.Yes, I realize this might sound a bit over the top but if history has taught us anything, it is the long term impact on nature (especially birds) can be much more detrimental than we imagine even from seemingly minor aspects of interaction. I would feel much better about the product if it were made from eco-friendly materials with a longer durability factor.Final note - the birds seem to enjoy it immensely!

Only useful for a small yard since you have to be connected to a hose to spray it, but that said it sprays better than messing with a sprayer that keeps getting clogged up. Not as smelly as the other brands and a lot cheaper."
1139,380,4,"I am really enjoying using my Char-Basket Briquet Holders in my Weber Kettle. It is great to be able to have focused direct heat in one section of the grill and indirect heat in another. The holders are heavy and sturdy.On Memorial Day, I was cooking burgers and dogs. One of my guests likes her burgers medium rare, so I was able to put hers on the indirect side while I continued to cook the others to medium well or well over direct heat. Since the hot dogs grilled much quicker, I could also move them over to indirect heat so they could continue to cook inside but not burn outside.The only downside to the holders for me is that I didn't see the one line in the product description that said they were for use with the Weber 22 1/2"" grill. I have an 18 1/2"" Weber so using them both gives me a very narrow field of indirect heat. However, when I am just grilling one steak for myself, I could just use ONE of the holders and have the rest of the grill cooler for veggies, etc.It is likely that I will upgrade to a Weber 22 1/2"" grill at some point since my 18 1/2"" is starting to show signs of wear. Then I'll be able to use both holders as intended. Despite them not being intended for my smaller Weber, I still find them to be useful. Because there are 2 holders, you can customize their configuration to work for you despite grill size.4.5 stars"
2,659,5,"If you are reading this, you are looking for a solution to your indoor flea infestation. I had a room with hardwood floors infested with fleas after fostering a rescue cat and her kittens. It was so bad that it sounded like popcorn popping when you opened the door! I tried Suspend with Archer, but was still infested after 4 treatments! I tried some horribly smelly pyrethin spray that did nothing to the fleas.Talstar, as part of my recipe, is what finally did work!I mixed these three chemicals together at the recommended levels with water in a 1-gal sprayer (all purchased from Amazon):1) Talstar Pro insecticide (active ingredient: 7.9% Bifenthrin)2) Dominion insecticide (active ingredient: 21.4% Imidacloprid)3) Nyguard IGR (active ingredient: Pyriproxyfen)4) Smith 1-gallon Chemical SprayerFirst let me warn that Talstar is not really recommended for broadcast spray indoors, however I was willing to try anything that might work. Talstar is a very strong insecticide. Dominion contains the same chemical used in Advantage topical flea treatment (do NOT use Dominion on pets though!). Nyguard stops eggs and larvae from hatching.To mix and spray these chemicals, I wore a respirator mask and I recommend wearing long pants tucked into rubber rain boots, long sleeves, goggles, and elbow length chemical-resistant gloves. The chemicals are low odor, but to be safe you should crack the windows to ventilate and keep pets and people out of the treated room. Remove EVERYTHING from the floor including closets. Vacuum the floor and discard the bag or empty it in an outside trashbin. Spray the entire floor, with extra into the baseboard cracks. If cats were in the room, spray windowsills too. Leave the room and let it dry.After the first spray with this mix, nearly all fleas were DEAD that day! A week later, only a few flea eggs had managed to survive and hatch, and the second spray eliminated them. No return of fleas! Just for good measure, I sprayed a third time (all 3 spraying were 1 week apart), and I left the room with the residue on the floor for several weeks after the last spray. Just be safe I mopped the floors with pinesol twice to remove any trace of the chemicals before allowing any pets to enter the room. This long process may be overly cautious but I didn't want any possibility of a reinfestation by mopping too soon, and I wouldn't take a chance of poisoning to my pets! If I ever have to deal with fleas again, I won't wast my time or money with other chemicals. I will use Talstar with Dominion and Nyguard and be done with it."
1623,722,4,"The Garden Genius PF11-1T Durable Pot Filler Disc is a great idea and works well, but the cost seems extreme for what you get. I have a half dozen large containers on the porch and every year struggle with the weight of maintaining them since they are full of rocks and soil. The Pot Filler Disc fills the bottom of large flower pots to cover drainage holes and provide an alternative for filling the bottom of the pot with rocks. I thought this would be more substantial, and was surprised when it arrived to find that it is a thick disc, but less than 2 inches thick. The name ""pot filler"" made me think it would take up more volume in the pot. I do like it though, and it serves its purpose very well. I would buy more if they were about half the price."
751,825,5,"I used to use a rigged up system of cinch straps (commonly used for securing dirt bikes and motorcycles) to hang my lights. I found these when ordering another light system and I'll tell you what, I don't know how I EVER used to deal with hanging lights before. Sure chains are cool as you can move a link at a time, but these ratcheting style lights are awesome.Depending on the light I have hanging I am able to pull the slack and raise my lights and can reach up and release the locks to lower as I need. They metal gears are pretty strong and the whole system seems very well built. I have since bought two more sets."
856,838,5,"One thing I hate doing is rolling up a vinyl garden hose or a hose that kinks. I took this hose out of the included pouch and hooked it up. Looking at it I was thinking that there is no way this is a 75 foot hose. As soon as i put the nozzle on it and charged it the entire hose expanded! I was amazed at how this worked and how easy it was to set up. After use and drained the water and it went back to its original size, fitting back into the original pouch it came with! The only thing that I would include with it is a quick disconnect plug, so you don't have to unscrew the house each time. I was able to get one at a local retail store for a couple bucks! I will follow up on this review if any problems or issues occur. As of now this appears to be a great idea! 11-21-13; As i put this away for the season I have to say this is probably the best hose I have ever purchased. I have not had any issues with leakage or splitting. I am careful to make sure the hose is extended before filling it so it will not burst. As long as you extend it before turning the water on yo will be fine. Break down is easy as the house will literally shrink down from it's 75 foot size to a more manageable 25 feet or less. Wrap it up and store it in the included nylon bag. Will definitely purchase another one of these so I can extend the length."

265,612,4,"I live in a glass house (a mid-century modern, actually), so I am keen to any new ideas to clean windows. Of course I jumped all over the opportunity to get this through the Vine program, but I'm always skeptical of product claims. However, after trying this product, I can honestly say it works better than I thought it would.Pros---While it seems like it has low power, it has proven to be enough to slurp up glass cleaner, as long as you don't try to race through the process---Fairly streak free results, you just have to make sure the cleaning blade has nothing stuck on it---Replaceable rubber blade. Appears to be a standard size you can find replacements for in many stores. This is important because the sharpness of the rubber edge determines how streak free the results are, so you need to change the rubber blade over time. Not needing to buy a proprietary replacement is a big plus---Works when you turn it on its side, which you'll need to do at window bottomsCons:---Battery life is decent but not great---Bulkiness. The key to streak free cleaning of large windows, like the 8' x 9' plate glass windows I have, is to be able to make large, sweeping passes over a large area. Professional window cleaners almost do this as an art form. I don't know why it works, but if you get in a good groove, you can clean large areas with no streaks in a matter of minutes. However, this thing is a bulky machine that is not light like a traditional window squeegee and the grip is not thin or maneuverable enough for subtle shifting, so making those kinds of smooth, flowing arches on a large window is not really effectiveI have found that the only way to get glass really clean is to use a squeegee, but with no way to contain the glass cleaning liquid, it has always been an unwelcome and messy chore. This machine makes it easy to clean glass more often, especially bathroom mirrors, which tend to get dirty fast.On the whole, this machine is effective and easy enough to use for your average window and mirror cleaning needs. It makes cleaning glass much less of an issue because it cleanly sucks up the glass cleaning liquid. I did not have any drips as long as you don't try to race across the surface."
1160,492,4,"I love this tool. It is really robust.  It comes with a brush that you can change out with the bristles. Stainless steel. Long tool for bigger grills and you can get great leverage with it. Rubber handle pads allow you to grab it with both hands easily. My only problem with it is that the grooves to clean the grates are a bit off kilter and so you can't get the same leverage when you use this part. Also, the ergonomics of the tool make it easier to use the one side than the other."
1391,716,4,"This is a double-block Tomcat bait trap that will kill up to 12 mice each.  It&#8217;s not a trap that mice will be trapped in, but rather one that they will go into to eat the bait and leave.  It&#8217;s rather hard to see how much they&#8217;ve eaten at this point in time, but when the block is gone, the trap can be disposed of.  The bait is enclosed in the trap, but the top is clear plastic and it will be easy to see when it needs to be discarded.  Apparently with ingestion of a very small amount the mice will die within a couple of days, but not in the trap itself.We do have pets and obviously we don&#8217;t want anything around the house that can inadvertently harm them.  These are &#8220;Kid & Dog Resistant,&#8221; but if you have your doubts, take a pass and continue using the old Victor traps if need be.  I&#8217;ve even used the electronic method with some success.  I&#8217;m not going to be using any of the Tomcat Mouse Killer traps in any accessible place in the house, but rather in my small barn.Field mice usually are more problematic in the fall when they are heading to shelter, but manage to be busy throughout the year.  I&#8217;m using the Tomcats outside.  I do like the concept and like it much better than the d-Con I&#8217;ve tried in the past.  They came in a box and just seemed to attract more mice than they eliminated.  I also was concerned about how the poison seemed to be spread all over the place.  Not enamored with that method.I&#8217;m not quite sure how the Tomcat Mouse Killer system will work in the long run, but I definitely like the system.  I will not be using it in any place where animals or children will have easy access to it at all.  My comfort level isn&#8217;t high when I take any chances, which in the case of bromethain I&#8217;m not planning on it.  Better system than the open-boxed d-Con I&#8217;ve used in the past, but how well it works in the long run remains to be seen."
188,927,4,"Very adequate fire pit, but the price feels rather high for what you get.  We found it it to be sturdy and stable on our patio.  It's a smaller fire pit (about 28"" in diameter) than the other fire pits we have, but is good for smaller spaces.  The fact that it is cast iron makes us feel better about roasting food over the fire compared to fire pits with copper bowls.  But is also means it could rust more easily.  We'll update the review with more use to see how it holds up.  For now, a solid four stars."
1220,508,4,"The telescoping works, but the design requires extra brute-strength to use at the extended length.I got these shears to reach the tops of bushes that I can't get with my old short-handled shears, but that don't warrant investing in specialized power tools.My reach was indeed extended, but I found the shearing slow going. It turns out that the 9"" blades (vs the 10"" more common for this sort of tool) provide less leverage.  And if I'm reaching out, my arms will naturally be closer together, making it harder to use the full cutting motion.The end result is I get greater reach than with my old shears, but must use notably more effort to actually cut anything.  For me, this limits the tool to selective pruning rather than shaping or hedge-trimming.The extending part of the handles is plastic, but the on the whole appears well constructed.The unique product design moves this up from 3 to 4 stars, but if you're doing a lot of hedge-clipping, something with better leverage will make your life a lot easier.  Recommended with reservations.Update: After a heavy multi-hour session one day, I find the blades no longer line up exactly right (there's a slight click every time I close the blades), even though I normally make a point of cleaning/oiling the blades regularly.  So I'll add the caveat ""lightweight use only"""
308,411,5,"I've tried many plastic nozzles each with a different set of sprays.  The reason I've had to ""try"" so many of them is that they always BREAK.  I was so fed up with spending $15 each time I needed a new one, that I looked into this.  Easily, this is the best garden purchase I've made in while.  From its full force jet spray to a fine mist, this can handle it all.  It hoses down my patio with ease and in an instant, I can put it on a fine spray or mist to water the flowers and pots.Fantastic!"
912,691,5,"I HAVE USED THE SAW ONCE SO FAR AND IT CUT THROUGH 6"" BRANCHES LIKE BUTTER. THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE REACH. I AM GOING TO WRITE DLACK & DECKER AND SEE IF THEY CAN SELL ADDITIONAL EXTENSION LENGTHS FOR HIGHER BRANCHES. THE SAW IS A BIT TOP HEAVY BUT WITH THE MOTOR AND THE END THIS WAS EXPECTED. I DID HAVE TO USE A LADDER WHICH THEY SAY SHOULD NOT BE USED. I HAVE JUST ORDERED ANOTHER OF THEIR YARD TOOLS WITH THE MAIN REASON BEING THE INTERCHANGEABLE BATTERIES ARE REALLY A GREAT IDEA AND A MONEY SAVER.FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SAID THE SAW WAS NOT SO GOOD I DOUBT IF THEY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. I HAVE USED GAS POWERED CHAIN SAWS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND YOU HAVE TO TIGHTEN THE NEW CHAIN AFTER RUNNING FOR A FEW MINUTES. BEFORE TRYING TO CUT WOOD APPLY A LIBERAL AMOUNT OF OIL AND RUN FOR COUPLE OF MINUTES TO STRETCH OUT THE CHAIN AND THEN TIGHTEN THE CHAIN AS DIRECTED. THIS WILL ELIMINATE MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ ABOUT. ONE MORE HINT IS NOT TO GET DIRT ON THE CHAIN WHEN YOU PLACE IT ON THE GROUND OR CUT SOMETHING REALLY LOW. SOIL OF ANY KIND WILL DULL THE CHAIN IN A FEW SECONDS."
1399,673,1,"My other grasshog trimmer died after 8 years, and I picked this one up. Like others the auto-feeder had issues. It was binding on itself, would spit out too much line and get twisted up.

I will probably try another B&D but I would stay away from this one until they work the issues out."
153,849,4,"Birds have been using this feeder everyday since it was hung. They seem to like it just fine.My only complaint is that the bottom perch slips to one side after several birds have landed on it.Thank goodness that bar is only for perching and doesn't have anything to do with holding the food.I move the perch back in place every time I fill the feeder, but after a few birds have landed on it,it's moved to the side once again.Although this model is suppose to discourage squirrels by it's overall design and hooded perches,the lid doesn't lock and if squirrels can reach it - they'll empty it.I used extension hooks to hang the feeder several feet from anything ~ and out of reach of squirrels lungingon the feeder ~ and so far squirrels haven't gotten to it.This all metal feeder holds 4 1/2 cups food.The clear window for viewing level of feed isn't as useful as it might have beenbecause the bottom of the window is 7"" up from the bottom of the feeder.The window pulls out, bottom easily comes off and the perches pull out for cleaning.Feeder size - 17"" tall, plus 5"" hanger - x 3"" dia."
216,268,5,Looking at the build quality of this cover makes you wonder just how much profit other companies are making for their poorly made ones which cost almost the exact same.  This is of high quality fabric and I'm actually very surprised it only cost $33.  The pockets are a nice touch and the pull string to keep it all together make for a nice outdoor cover.  Buy this one and you will be pleasantly surprised.
274,714,4,"We have had a couple mice take up residence in our home unfortunately. They were flipping over our traps and taking the bait without taking the punishment which wasn't working towards ridding us of our problem. I wasn't sure what to expect from these bait stations but was hoping the mice would be interested enough to wander in there and eat the bait. Sure enough, the first night they went for the bait station over the peanut butter trap. They ate about a sixth of the brick the first night, more the next night, and again for a few nights beyond that. I have no idea if it was the same mouse or multiple mice, but bottom line is- we have no more signs of mice and nothing is going for the bait anymore. I assume they made their way out of the house and died, because we have not found any signs or smells of dead mice inside the house. I really don't much care how it works, only that it works! I will be keeping these on hand.The larger rat size station is perfect for outside the house to get them before they even make it inside."
559,792,3,"This is a decent little bird waterer that suffers from one major flaw (in my experience): it basically doesn't replenish itself. I have to manually come over and squeeze the ""bottle"" to get an appreciable amount of water to come out into the dish below. If I don't do that then what comes out is a trickle at best that doesn't even completely cover the entire bottom of the dish. Other than that the waterer is reasonably attractive given that it looks like a water cooler bottle. It is quite small. You will want to have an extra hook or something if you're hanging it from a pole. My feeder pole has two arms that curve upward on the ends to prevent what's on them from falling off; the hole on top of this bird waterer is so small that I spilled a ton of water just trying to fit it over the arm on my feeder pole, and it's not even very wide. A decent waterer that in my case at least is more trouble than it should be."

Anyway, I sat and watched this feeder and it only took 17 minutes for the first hummingbird to stop by and try it out.  I tried to get a picture, but I am not fast enough.  The hummingbirds love it!"
1247,873,5,Every spring I dread the job of cleaning the winter cover on our pool. It's vinyl and gets pretty bad from the accumulation  of dirt and leaves that lie in the water which builds up in the winter. I have tried different products with moderate success but even the best of those required a lot of elbow grease. Initially spraying the cover with this and after leaving it set about 10 minutes I then was able to rinse most stains away with just a nozzel on the hose. Those that didn't come off the first time got a second application and pretty much all came off. And on top of that I didn't concern myself about any that made it's way into the pool. I would recommend this for any similar clean up jobs.
26,159,3,The inflator is made well.  My only issue is the gauge which is hard to read.  The numbers should be larger.Update 11-2009  This will not work with needles for inflating a basketball.  I have no idea why.
1175,893,5,"This is an exceptional product: well-made, comfortable, light-weight. But most importantly they work wonderfully. I have never had a lopper that performed so well. The branches I have pruned were like butter. This utilizes your force much better than any previous product. It doesn't telescope, but anything within reach or on a ladder will be very easy to prune exactly as you want.We have some huge roses and using a hand pruner is impossible. I cannot wait until spring to try these on our roses. I am sure they will make quick work of what was an onerous/hard job. Bottom-line is the construction makes for the best possible use of your force and the blades cut through branches like tissue. It also has a handy storage piece for the blades that locks into place. Highly recommended."

1142,764,4,"I got this item primarily for sucking up leaves, as I prefer to avoid blowing my yard clippings and other detrius into the neighbors' houses.  I have live oaks trees, and the pollen has fallen all around the sidewalk and built up into an unsightly mess.  The plan was simple:  test out this B&D; model, and if I didn't like it, I could fall back on my cordedToro 51609 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed (up to 235) Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impelleras backup.  On my wishlist for design is an item that neither has: while both have shoulder straps for the *bags*, neither has a strap for the actual blower/vac, which is the heavy part of the setup.  It would be nice to have the heavy part supported so you don't have to hand hold it the entire time.SETUP --------This was very easy straight out of the box.  Pieces clip together, although it was a bit challenging to push them together... it's a rather tight fit.  The vacuum bag clips on easily.  The battery charger is relatively quick, and the battery itself came with a charge (although I don't know how much, as I went ahead and charged it prior to use).  Controls are self-explanatory and very user-friendly. There is a variable amount of suction, from 1-6.USE -----------PRO --- The vacuum operates relatively quietly, and the cordless nature of it makes it very easy to continue working around trees.  It sucked up pollen pretty well at the ""2"" setting, although I used it mostly at ""6"" to get into crevices.  The overall unit is lighter than my Toro, and because it doesn't mulch like the Toro, there were fewer noises and noticeably less impacts as things got sucked up.  I didn't have to be as careful about small twigs.CON --- Suction is not *quite* as strong as the Toro, even on its strongest setting, as I needed to go back over some crevices with the Toro to get all the materials out.  Also, in the grass itself, it struggled to pull leaves out, whereas the Toro got many of the leaves out of the section when I went over it again.  The B&D; bag is small, making emptying more frequent.  (On the other hand, this kept it lighter to carry).  Although I was running it on ""6"" and could have run lower, I didn't expect it to run out of charge as fast as it did.  I got about 1/2 of the sidewalks cleared, and I'd hoped to get closer to all of them.BOTTOM LINE --- I really like this item.  I like using it more than the Toro.  I wish I could have gotten the whole yard with it.  I wish the charge didn't shut me of partway through, and that the suction got into crevices the same way the Toro does.  Having said that, for small projects, this works quite well."
516,577,2,"There's a saying that if you want to make money, you need to build a better mouse trap.  Victor has been building mouse traps for many years and this year build a new mouse trap, one that is a lock down model that seals in the dead mouse and all of its problems  - problem is that is not a better mouse trap.  And it's much, much more expensive.  I figure if you all you want to do is to feed and house your mice, go ahead and buy the expense condo model.Test setup:1) Two older Victor mouse traps and two new mouse ""condo"" traps.  I used peanut butter for the bait and set all four in my shed where the mice had nested in my Toro Walk-behind lawnmower - but that is another story.  Yes, when you pull the cord and start it, they come flying out - and no mice were harmed in this fiasco.  Although they did stare at me with an attitude.2) I came back the next day and counted my mice.  The older traps killed two mice (one each) and the newer, gentler model killed one.  However, the one that remained unsprung was missing its bait.  Licked off the peanut butter clean as a whistle.3) Re-set two more reliable older models and the sprung and reset the newer, mouse motel model - with the dining room option.4) Came back for the body count the next day.  The two older models had one mouse each - dead of course.  However, the newer patio model with the now empty dining car was still without a mouse - but it now offered mouse dropping in the entrance hall just to make sure that I knew that we housed and fed one guest.Conclusions:  Save your money and buy the old, cheap stand by wooden traps that work.  If you can't stand to see a dead mouse and are afraid of all the possible parasites, mites, ticks, etc., then be ready to spend your retirement money attempting to catch them all in these bed and breakfast models."

216,672,1,"I have owned B&D cordless outdoor equipment for 10+ years.  They are of such high quality I rarely need to replace them.  But the batteries are so expensive, sometimes it pays to just buy new.  Enter this trimmer...my first use lasted about 3 minutes and I did notice it spun much faster and louder than my previous 18V.  I went to hang it back up on the wall but first decided to check the line length remaining out of curiosity.  It had maybe 5 inches left!  Huh?  It was a new spool when I installed it.  All I did was trim grass, I thought to myself.  Next week I installed a new line and made absolute sure that I was trimming grass and not dirt.  Same result.  I called B&D and was told this was an issue with the older models but not this one.  She sent me a replacement for free.  I tried the second one and had the exact same experience.  Back it went as well.  I am just going to replace batteries in my old model because using a spool a use compared to one every year is just ridiculous to me."
1679,351,3,"I had a lot of success with the previous Perky Pet bird feeder I requested from Vine. During the fall migration, we had a lot more feathered visitors than usual--and by ""more"" I mean both in terms of sheer numbers and variety of species. Since we also have a high squirrel population (cute, interesting, ubiquitous and greedy) I thought the Squirrel-Be-Gone (SBG) would be a perfect addition to the yard.So, because we didn't have an extra feeder hanger when the SBG arrived, we took down the reliable feeder and replaced it with this.  In the meantime, I bought food that was a much better quality than the generic stuff we'd been using, hoping to reduce the waste.The SBG hung for DAYS and remained full.  Occasionally a sparrow would hop on one of the little perches and then fly away. We couldn't figure it out. Did they not like the feeder openings? Did they prefer the cheaper food? Maybe the cheap seed was the equivalent of fast food, and they were ""junk-food junkie"" birds.A squirrel did jump onto the shepherd's hook hanger and try to access the food, but after bouncing around for a few minutes he left in frustration.  So, the SBG does discourage Shadow-Tails.Then, we installed another hanger and filled our original feeder, and the birds rediscovered our yard. The feeder emptied within hours. So, they obviously liked the food.The full SBG hung there, still full, still ignored.Eventually, though, maybe out of desperation, the birds started to sample seed from the SBG. Mainly house sparrows, but you have to start somewhere. Maybe they'll spread the word that poking their heads into the little feeder openings will not get them guillotined.We have seen nowhere near the enthusiasm our original feeder triggered. But now that spring migration has started, along with a cold front, it will be interesting to see if we get more avian traffic.Perky Pet is a good company. Both feeders are well-made and attractive. The Squirrel-Be-Gone is easy to set up and adjust so that birds can get the food and squirrels can't. It's also easy to fill and clean.I am still not sure why it's taking so long for this feeder to become a hit with the birds. But if they start mobbing the feeder, I will post an update."

293,933,4,"We have several hummingbird feeders in our yard and are always on the lookout for another one to add to help provide multiple areas for the birds to go which helps cut down on the territorial behavior enough to allow more than one bird to use the feeders (too many to defend). We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try. Here is what we liked:1. This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!! Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean. This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2. The color definitely attracts them. There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds. The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.  Should also note that the amount of nectar included with this will NOT fill the feeder.3. If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay. The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4. This feeder holds more than enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway. We found that if we fill it about 1/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out. Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement. ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1. The perch is much better than some of their other styles, but is still sort of a pain to keep aligned. It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.  Being a one piece circle does make it easier to align.2.  This unit is WAY too large, at least in our area.  The hummingbirds in our area do not usually allow others to feed at the same time, thus it takes quite a bit of time to go through the amount of nectar that this unit will hold.  If, however, you happen to live in an area where several will share a feeder at the same time, this may work out for you.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should. One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!! When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage."

This product was effective in reducing both populations to a manageable level within a week. I've also used this to deal with an ant hill to great effect. You must keep in mind when using this product that it doesn't discriminate against good vs bad insects, and should be used sparingly as a treatment, not as a deterrent."
1440,897,4,"The Perky-Pet Fly Through Wild Bird Feeder is great too look at, and very functional. It is easy to fill, easy to use and great for birds of all types. The large holes are great for birds of all variety and size, and it is fun to watch them in action. All home gardens are not complete without the Perky-Pet Fly Through Wild Bird Feeder. Great job!!"
1121,657,4,"I've got a narrow shelf above a half-height dividing wall that separates the kitchen from the living room, and I wanted something long and narrow to put a large Pothos in. There is room for two of these end-to-end, and I may get another one to make a solid area of green across that shelf to help disguise the kitchen.I picked up a large-leafed Pothos in a hanging basket from Ingle's and planted it in the center of this window box. As the trailers on &#34;the kitchen side&#34; get longer, I tuck them into the dirt at the sides (without cutting them off), where they root along the buried parts, making for a spreading lush mass of green along the length of the planter. On the living room side, I'm letting them just grow and hang down, which looks nice, and will cut them back only when they start reaching the floor.This is not a self-watering planter, although it does have a drip tray, so you have to be careful not to overwater. That's why a Pothos is so good because they can handle a lot of abuse and are fine with minimal water. I don't water until I see a leaf or two starting to yellow and, if the soil seems completely dried out, I give the whole surface of the soil a bit of a drink and then pour some more in the center where the original plant was planted.It's a great look for a small price, and this planter comes in several colors that would blend with any decor."

166,102,5,"These mats (I bought two) operate exactly as advertised.  I raised an astounding number of seedlings this past spring using these mats.  I'm sure my germination rate was greatly influenced by the use of the mats.  Then, after spring, I cleaned them up and am storing them for the next season of use."
1508,908,5,"I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review but was not compensated for the review in any way.This was my first time using a meat injector, and turns out it's really a great grilling item to have. I gave this review 5 stars because this injector is so easy to use, keeps the grilled meat very moist, and is so flavorful while eating. I highly recommend this one. It's easy to clean up after use, and honestly, it really makes the meat so moist I never have to worry about grilling anything dry again, and you can use whatever you like in it for the juicy flavor it will give you."
1328,899,5,"I usually like to leave the outside work to my husband - but this inspired ME to leave the kitchen (I love baking/cooking) outside and suck up the leaves. I'm only 5'4 and about 110 pounds but found this wasn't too heavy to use. It was so easy to put together (but one thing I'd recommend to manufacture is to label the parts to the vacuum - that was the only thing that tripped me up a bit). I've never ever used any machine to pick up leaves (just a good old fashion rake!)- so I can't really compare this to anything. I was attracted to this seriously because of it's color and what appeared to be its simplicity. The charge seems to hold and the bag is easy to throw over my shoulder and then empty. I love this and would highly recommend it - with something this simple AND good looking, it might inspire more women like me (a girly girl!) to pick it up, get outside, and do some work! Though I recommend if your wife does do that, it might be nice for you to whip up a great dinner for her!"

1027,953,5,"When moving into my house nearly ten years ago, I first started with a corded trimmer. Untangling and tripping over the cord was a massive irritation, not to mention having to attach several of them together to reach the farthest corners of my backyard.So I upgraded to theBlack & Decker LST220 12-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless GrassHog Trimmer/Edger. This was a major improvement and I was happy with it until I got my hands on the GreenWorks Cordless Lithium-Ion String Trimmer/Edger. The longer shaft and adjustable handle on the GreenWorks made all the difference. The sturdiness and longer battery life were nice too, but I found the balance was slightly off and the trimmer head was never quite at the ideal angle for my arm length (even though it was somewhat adjustable).Two years later, I was introduced to the OREGON Cordless ST275-A6. It was like upgrading from a Toyota to a Lexus. Both very good in their own right, but the OREGON is more refined.I say refined, but in a sense it's simpler. No pivoting head, auto line feed or guide wheels. But I found I didn't need them. The OREGON is balanced and positioned perfectly for my long arms. The bump feed makes for an extra step, but gives you control over how much line you use (plus a more simplified system means cheaper repairs if it breaks down). The dual line increases efficiency by providing a cleaner cut and is better for thick overgrown grass. And because there are two lines, it keeps the vibration level at a minimum, which is great for people using this professionally -- less nerve trauma at the end of a long day. The best part, for me, is the large grip handle. Surprisingly, this was a commonly flawed feature on all the trimmers I've previously tried. But the OREGON got it perfectly! Sturdy, comfortable grip, ideal height, and can be positioned on -- rotate and slide up or down -- the shaft exactly how I want it.If you cut lawns professionally, or just want a better experience in your own backyard, then I recommend giving this OREGON a try."
54,577,2,"I placed these where I've caught numerous mice with regular traps, and had been seeing mice again, on my kitchen counter. But I never got one! And it's weird how you can't see in; I know you're supposed to just assume it's set or sprung by the lever on the side, but I don't know... Just stick with the original."
283,101,5,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use, just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit, or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok, I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
1120,416,4,"This hose cart is light years beyond those poly hose carts that cost 30 to fifty dollars and last a year or two. I just replaced one that is less that a year old with thes Lewis Steel Hose Cart.The cart is ruggedly built and comes with a high quality leader hose. The metal connections all look and feel substantial.Putting the cart together was a little problematic even though there are few pieces.It took more effort and time to screw on the crank handle than I would have imagined. For some reason the threads just wouldn't mesh or connect. After finally getting the handle on I noticed that the crank was bent inward didn't make a full revolution because it hit the framework after each half turn.A manufacturer's rep, reached using the 800 number provided, was very courteous and suggested I try to bend the handle out manually. She thought it must have been bent inward during transport. Fortunately the handle bending strategy worked and the cart works well.This cart may hold two hundred feet of hose, but it barely contains my two hundred feet of hose. My hoses are 5/8"" and heavy. Two hundred feet of cheaper hose will fit on the reel easily.The hose connections are leak free and the crank turns with minimal effort. Despite the assembly problems, I like this cart and would buy it again.Be aware that the pneumatic tires must be inflated."
1178,167,5,"Arrived in record time with easy to follow instructions and sprayer - even had batteries included that still had a charge.  I've used mixes in the past so this was not messy as well as easy and quick to spray on those new sprouts coming up.Sprayed two days ago and haven't seen any damage from rabbits or deer yet.  Time will tell though - I'll see how long the new plants go untouched, how often I have to spray and how long it lasts.  The 'mix' that I use has an AWFUL smell -- I didn't notice that with this so time will tell how well it works and I have my doubts.One thing about it - it's a pleasure not having to pump air into the sprayer.  This is going to be a reusable, lightweight container for me."
136,513,4,"I have had a Defender model of this product made by the original manufacturer (American Biophysics which went bankrupt in 2007). This one is now made by Woodstream who bought the assets of American Biophysics.Anyway, these are by far the best devices to catch mosquitos and work exactly as described. After 3 to 4 weeks you will see a huge reduction in the numbers of mosquitos. The new executive trap I just got through the vine program started right up and has been catching well for the last 3 weeks. I am just about at the end of my first tank of propane so the rest of the story has yet to be seen. Like this product, the Defender caught tons of mosquitos. Unfortunately it also had to be sent back every year to be repaired when it wouldn't start up at the start of the season (and yes, I cleaned it and stored it exactly as they instructed). The repairs run anywhere from $80 to $250 and are done by third parties independent of Woodstream. Time will tell if this Executive product has the same issues as the original Mosquito Magnets had. I will update this review once I see how the device fares on restart. If it works well I will probably buy another one and dispose of the Defender.Just to leave on a positive note: This device is battery powered and still going strong at the end of 3 weeks. The manual says it should be able to get through the summer on one charge. This is way more convenient that the Defender model which require 120 volt power, therefore a very long extension cord (you place this away from where people are going to be since it attracts mosquitos to itself and then kills them).Update as of July 23rd, 2011. The rechargeable battery is doing quite well so far. The manual says it will run all season on one charge. This appears to be correct. I just replaced the first tank of propane. I used two CO2 cleaning cartridges and the unit started up just fine. This is a good sign. The real test will be if it starts up fine next spring.Update for May 5th of 2013 (Happy Cinco de Mayo): For the third season in a row this unit has started right up. Whatever problems they had with the earlier units seem to have been fixed in this model. I did the shut down cleaning last fall just like they recommend in the manual and did a start up cleaning this spring. I use three cartridges each time now just to be safe (If you buy them in boxes of 25 the price is low enough to do three at a time). The rechargeable battery lasted all season last year."
1488,928,5,I used this on my large lawn and my grass looks terrific. I will definitely use this product again. It is very good for grass here in Ohio. We have had a late spring  my grass is looking very green with no dried grass at all. I love this lawn restore.
1134,692,4,"We have a fairly small front yard and no other grass, so we were able to mow it with half a charge. Some reviewers claim to have no problems doing a half-acre yard and others say they can't finish a 1/3rd-acre yard. If I had a half-acre yard, I would get a gas mower. I wouldn't pay $250+ for 2 batteries every 2-3 years. Also, stopping in the middle of mowing to change batteries sounds like a big nuisance.I don't think this mower has any overwhelming advantages over the latest gas mowers. The main reason we got this is so that we don't have to mess with checking and filling the gas tank, but IMO, that is about the only advantage.It does a good job of cutting and mulching. Anyone who is having problems with the mulching may not be setting the height up enough. It shows on the mower that a setting of 4+ inches is required for the mulching to work right.We checked under the mower when done cutting and there was no grass build-up at all under it.Negatives:It is not as quiet as I was expecting it to be, but it is much quieter than our old gas mower.Either the handle or the part it attaches to was bent so the left side of the handle does not fit flush, but it's close enough to work.It came with a tear in the foam around the handle.As others have said, the slowest speed setting is still as fast as we would want to go, so the faster speeds are wasted. B&D; should adjust this, but it still works for us. When turning to go back at the edge of a lawn, if you let go of the self-propel control, it can be hard to maneuver and if you don't let go, it wants to whip you around.The directions were very confusing. For example the self-propelled model has two ""bales"" (wires above and below the handle) - one to control the blade and one to control the wheels. Yet the instructions keep referring to ""the bale"" without saying which one."
73,707,5,"I'm sorry the other reviewer had a problem with his machine.  I'm glad I didn't see his review until after I purchased my unit.I was pondering getting a backup natural gas generator, so I knew the Generac name had some quality associated with it.  I was not let down with the unit.  It started up very nicely (they even give you 20 oz of SAE 10W-30 oil).  So far I'm impressed."
879,283,4,"I've used Pantry Pest traps for years. I always have enough rice, flour, barley, etc., to last a few years. Therefore, moth traps are always in the storage area.These are slightly different than my last batch, which had a cone shaped lure and black stripes on the inside.Usually, after putting a trap out, at least 3 or 4 get caught within a few weeks. This time, only 1.They are still effective, obviously. Perhaps I simply have fewer pests."
1132,95,5,"Makes a great little seat, keeps the contents dry. I store a 5gal bucket in here with my grilling tools and it fits perfectly with some room to the side for other stuff. This is great for us on our small balcony since it is both a seat and storage. It is sturdy enough to stand on, and it keeps the weather out well. Great value!"
1102,712,5,"The ground has been covered with snow for so long and all the holly berries my robins munch on are long gone so I thought I would try these. I have a robin - or her daughters - that have been nesting on my patio for 7 years and they are like family. Four hang out all winter, much to their detriment this year, and one pretty much lives on the patio so I felt obliged to feed them. They love these although the starlings have found them as well. I just make sure she gets her fill in the morning. Bought a second bag being as the snow shows no signs of melting yet."
854,937,5,"This hose reel is both pretty and convenient.  I like that it hangs on the wall rather than sitting on the ground because it is less in the way (I don't have a deck to worry about).  And the rotating feature will let me move my hose around to different parts of my yard so much more easily.The back brackets are just over 10 inches long so they fit perfectly and lie flat on my 1950s cedar shakes.  If you have smaller siding, you might have more trouble getting it to sit right on the siding.  (The installation instructions contemplate a flat wall.) The reel pieces go on after you fasten the bracket piece so you don't have to hold the whole thing while you fasten it to the wall.Speaking of fastening, this product does not come with the screws necessary to mount it on your wall.  So it would be a good idea to go out and get the screws while you wait for this to arrive.  The manufacturer recommends (4) 7 or 8 mm lag screws with washers (5/16"" x 2 1/2"") for a flat wood frame wall.  For a brick masonry wall they suggest (4) 7 or 8 mm x 60 mm masonry wall anchors, (4) anchor sleeves, (4) washers, (4) lock washers, and (4) nuts.I am slightly concerned about how this metal hose reel will hold up in Minnesota weather.  However, the manufacturer suggests the hose reel part be taken off and stored indoors or sealed in a plastic container over the winter.  That just leaves the bracket to worry about."
797,870,4,"Good cleaning without too many chemicals.Pros:- Some surprising gunk showed up when this was placed (and we thought it was clean. Gunk did not show up when using it in a glass of &#34;fresh water&#34;.- Enzymes as opposed to straight up chemicals- Good value/money propositionOverall, this product seems to do a good job cleaning the tub. I'll update later to see if the other claims are true (change water less often for example).For now, I'd say give it a shot. Solid product, no cons right now."
1094,237,3,"I tried this product for a mole in my front yard.  It was easy to use but I wore disposable gloves just to be safe.  I didn't cut the worms in half, I just made a hole and tossed one in whole.  I noticed mole activity for a couple of days afterwards but not it seems to have died down so it quite possibly worked.  No mole has surfaced and died so I can't really know for sure."
773,267,5,"Got to love the Havahart traps...  So easy to set the trap.  I was recommended to try marshmallows to trap raccoons, and have had luck in the past using them.  But my new pest, (who moved into an old outhouse), arrived during the rainy season, which is hard on marshmallows, so we used tuna.  I removed the lid of a can of tuna, then squeezed the can until it was warped into oval that was almost closed.  You don't want it easy for the critter to reach through and get the prize, since raccoons are very very crafty...  Place the can in the center of the trap, and wait for morning.  Once you have your pest, you can safely use the handle to lift the cage and transport the animal to parts unknown, then simple roll the cage over, which allows the door to open and the animal to leave.  Good luck!"
685,406,4,This is good for trimming branches up high.  It is light enough in weight that anyone can easily use it.
843,193,5,"This rat zapper is awesome! I live in the city so of course there are going to be rats! They are so big the damn cats in the neighborhood won't do anything about it. I noticed a rat in my trash can, so that is when I bought the ultra rat zapper. I have probably killed 15 rats. I use dry dog food and sometimes I will put a little bit of peanut butter on a small piece of paper towel and put it inside the trap."
681,40,5,"I leave it out, tow it around with the hose attached and forget to drain it come winter. Still working great after two years!"
216,20,5,"This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw. This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires. It is not directional, so you don't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way. I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was. Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap."
980,535,5,"Buying an ash bucket seemed like a silly waste of money; our aluminum pail worked fine, and this fancy little thing seemed to be frivolous.  On a whim, we bought this on amazon just because we had company coming over and we thought it might make it easier for them to clean the fireplace when we were gone.Now, we love it. The little shovel on the side of the bucket works better than our long shovel from our fireplace set.  The lid isn't too tight, the size is perfect, the wood handle easy to carry.Silly for us to not buy this a long time ago.  It looks nice, it is easier to clean out ashes, and the price point is perfect.  Recommended."
1110,839,5,"I was a little skeptical when I ordered this; would it REALLY have just the right combination of pliability and rigidity to gently raise the edge of an omelet without tearing it?  And, would it be an improvement over my favorite, tried-and-true-favorite 1989 model spatula?The answer is a resounding YES.I've cooked two omelets with it so far and the results were excellent.I like to cook mine by gently lifting the edges all around the omelet, allowing uncooked egg to seep to the bottom of the omelet after it's slightly set.  I continue to do this for a couple of minutes, until the top begins to set.  Then I cover the pan, leave it on heat for about 30 seconds, remove completely from heat (while covered) and allow the omelet to completely ""set,"" which takes about 3-4 minutes.  If I add cheese, I do it just seconds before removing it from the heat source. If I add fillings like mushrooms, peppers, and onions, I scatter the pre-sauteed fillings over the melted cheese, season, then fold the omelet and serve.This little tool makes this job quite a bit easier.  I'm impressed with the size of the ""folder"" part of the tool--it will work well with any size omelet and makes it easier to get a good, even fold for a lovely presentation.The tip of the tool is just the right size and shape for the lifting/tucking required to allow the uncooked egg to seep under the omelet in the early stages of cooking.  And it makes moving from pan to plate a WHOLE lot easier.As I said, I'm a convinced skeptic.  It works great for omelets and can double for baking duties--happily recommended!"
799,273,5,CobraCo 24-Inch to 36-Inch Adjustable and Expandable Flower Box Holderby CobraCoEasy to install. Very practical and if you use your imagination more than one way to use it. Good value for a good product. Thank you Cobra!
223,597,5,"I got this before the snow,so I couldn't review it.Now that we did get a few inches of snow,I can say it works very well.Throws the snow far,its more quiet then my vacuum cleaner,was packed great,all bubble wrapped,no way any thing could get scratched.Not much to put it together.I think this will be MUCH better then the shovel,and plus the gas ones are 400 to 600 just for a decent one,there is no messing with fuel,or pull starting.I'm happy!!Edit: the shoot that directs the snow,will freeze up if its real cold!!"
1513,267,5,"I have used an earlier version of this trap to help rid the condominium complex where I was living at the time of invasive raccoons and feral cats by trapping them and taking them to the animal shelter.  I liked it then, and I like it even better now.  The most important improvement over the earlier version is that there is a far larger solid metal shield around the handle, which should contribute greatly to peace of mind for anybody carrying off an angry raccoon in this trap.  It's also somewhat easier to set the trap.  I didn't find this to be difficult with the previous model, but the new mechanism is a small improvement.I'll note that the axle for the trap door got stuck in the side of the box in which the manufacturer packed the trap.  This resulted in difficulties in extracting the trap from the box and necessitated a tiny bit of work to put the axle back in place."
1437,754,3,"it's kind of hard to figure out how to set this up.  It did actually kill the mouse, although it crawled pretty far away before it died.  Broke after a couple of uses, though."
358,2,5,"For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!"
1403,527,4,"I love this feeder, and it looks great on the porch, but I haven't really seen any humming birds around it yet.  I think I'm not in a good area for those things.  Plus it's probably not the time of year for them to come out.  I don't know.  But it looks good anyway, and I like it.  It's also very easy to clean compared to other humming bird feeders."
838,162,5,"I expect this nozzle to out-last my hose and reuse it several times over. Also, being made of brass, and aluminum my hose nozzle doesn't get stuck on the thread like those plastic ones that expand when it's been out in the sun too long!"
457,551,5,"These covers are not only well made, but they look great.  The fabic is heavy and solid and does not become brittle when it gets cold outside as so many other have done.  It fits snugly over the compressor unit and has a pull cord at the bottom so that you can make it really snug.  Even has an opening for the coolant pipes and electrical line to come in and out of the unit.  Best covers I have ever found; and I've unsed a number of others and they all got brittle and cracked and had to be thrown away within a year or two.  I expect these to last many years."
1271,473,4,"I read the reviews on the beetle traps and found that they worked well overall. The Tangle foot worked so well that I had to empty it every other day. This was fairly easy to do with this unit. Here is the problem: the reviewers of many of these units questioned whether  beetles were being attracted from great distances to the traps which actually brought more beetles to your yard than might have been without the traps. The summer that I used the traps I had beetles everywhere. The next summer I didn't use any traps and still had some beetles, but not anywhere near as many as the year before. This is not a scientific study. Was the difference in beetles due to the traps, just fewer numbers on the given year or were they depleted by trapping from the year before. I don't know."
1605,403,2,"No way I would ever cart this with me on a camping trip.  Portable?  Carry it disassembled and assemble it at site?  That is a crazy idea:  Four foot-long panels with 12 nuts and 12mm bolts.  You'd need to carry a ratchet wrench also, because the tools provided are tiny and hard to work with.  I do better with rocks found at the site, and when I'm preparing a campsite, I have better things to do than screw together 12 nuts and bolts.  Bothering with something like this on a camping trip kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?Maybe there are camping locations that require a fire ring, but I'm not sure this would qualify as a ring that could contain a fire:  The sides are very low.  When you consider all the pierce-work, the sides are less than 6"" tall, and that is not tall enough to contain flame and sparks.This fire ring is made of fairly thin gauge metal, so it is flimsy.  Placed on its side, its own weight and gravity turns the 36"" circle into an oval.  A hefty falling log causes the ring to move and shift.I was hoping to use this in our yard to grill the way the Argentinians do, (check outSeven Fires: Grilling the Argentine Way (Hardcover)).  So I needed the metal to be strong enough to hold up a grill grate or a sheet of iron (kind of like an Argentinian chapa), but it definitely is not strong enough.  There is no reinforcing for the sides and even putting pressure on it with my hands causes it to bend and wobble.It is nice looking.  The horses look like horses.  It is stylish.  There is good coverage of the powder coating on the metal.  But that is all there is to say positive about this ring.  There is nothing else to it.  Why bother?  Natural flagstones are easy to find, less expensive, nice looking, and can be moved out of the way to remove ash."
482,470,4,"I got this because I have a huge ant problem outside this year - they're everywhere, they're everywhere! AND we've had several invasions into the house, of a couple of varieties. I used this product, even with some concerns about our pets - we have two cats that are indoor/outdoor, and I really do not want to hurt them.I did as the instructions say - I sprinkled around the foundation of the house, and put a couple of tablespoons right on some big ant mounds.One - it did kill some kinds of ants. The general scurrying-around population dropped by about half. BUT it did not get rid of my entire ant problem. I still have lots of the critters around.I guess this is not a bait like some ant products - the kind that says they'll carry it back to the nest, get the queen egg layer to dine on some, and the rest are toast. No - this says it kills on contact, and does not discriminate among ant types - or many other insects, including cockroaches. With the bait products, the question always seems to be what kind of ant is it? The type with a sweet tooth, and therefore you need sugar soaked in killer - or grease, or meat, or - especially, dry pet food. That always seems to create an ant highway for the army that enters the abode. Whatever kind I get, with Murphy's Law in play, it generally seems to be the wrong kind for that particular invasion.I haven't given up on Terro Ant Killer - but after two applications (followed by light watering, as per instructions), I have not set off the desired ant bomb. However, it did get rid of a bunch of ants, so I give it 4 stars, with one withheld for the rest of the critters who are still with us. And I'm after them as well. If I end up annihilating the busy six-legged ones, I'll come back and add the 5th star.Reinforcing the stars already assigned - the 3 lb shaker bag is a good idea. No need to measure out and sprinkle with a spoon or something else: just open, upend, shake gently, and the inner bag, with holes in it, lets out a decent amount, fairly evenly distributed. However, don't do like I did the first time and use it on a windy day! The stuff is super light, and I got some blowing up on me. As I was not trying to poison myself, I quit and waited for a quieter day.The bag has a zip lock resealer, which is no big deal these days, but a good idea.Overall, recommended - with the warning that it might not get rid of all the ants you are trying to kill."

541,181,4,"This product is a great supplement to the physical weeding you have to do with a weedeater or other device.  What you have to do is to spray the plant on Monday to let the toxin be carried to the root center.  Then, on Wednesday, if you insist on whacking the weed and not just spraying, you can go and tear it down.  It's crucial that the intact plant have 1 or 2 days to take in this product.  If you cut if down and then spray it, you may well be spraying to no effect.  It must be absorbed by a functioning leaf to really take effect.  It does work, but you must take care.  It's impossible to have a spray just for weeds; plants are plants, so if you misfire onto your prized shrub, you'd better spray water promptly to ensure its viability."
352,915,4,"Not only are these raised bed corners pretty to look at, but they also make the assembly process of a raised bed very simple. No screws are provided and at first I thought that this was being overly optimistic as to how sturdy these corners would be to hold the lumber in place, but they actually do a good job. I did press the lumber down into the ground just a bit for added security but other than that these corners are all that's holding the lumber together. Impressive really."
1230,211,5,"I bought these at $10. For 3 high-quality Fiskars tools, that is a fantastic value. The build quality is excellent. Rubber is thick and feels great in the hand. The aluminum is shiny, rust-proof, and extremely sturdy. The tools are very thick, but also very light-weight. I wasn't expecting the material to be so thick given the low price. I can't imagine these breaking during normal use (I have a small urban backyard garden plot of flowers and vegetables), but if they do, they are covered by a lifetime warranty.Do not hesitate. If you do any sort of gardening, order these tools. I am really happy I discovered this tool set. ""Fiskars"" is embossed in tiny letters along the orange part of the handle, but other than that, it's hard to tell these are Fiskars.They come in a plastic blister-pak that you'll have to cut open with scissors and discard. These really are great tools for the money."
1286,167,4,"This product is easy to use, and effectively repels vermin from my plants.The battery-powered sprayer includes four AA batteries required for operation. It has a three foot tube that extends from the lid, and I am able to hold the jug comfortably during application. The instructions mention a fine mist wand, but I didn't see one, but the main, twisting nozzle adjusts from stream to spray.The ""natural"" ingredients are clearly listed; however, these only make up 4.632% of the total solution. There are 95.368% of other undisclosed ingredients."
579,849,3,"I love squirrels - they are adorable creatures - but I cannot afford to feed them birdseed. I will say that my perspective has changed since moving from suburbia to the country. Country squirrels are smarter and more determined, as there aren't a lot of free meal choices around. Our country squirrels had no problem removing the plastic windows and emptying the feeder in short order. I will be transferring this feeder to my mother's house in the city, where she may have less loitering by squirrels that can go from house to house in her neighborhood and the cat will have fun looking at it out the window. For my personal feeders, however, I like to watch the beautiful birds - but they didn't have much of a chance with the squirrels all over this thing."
304,932,5,"This is my fourth hummingbird feeder, but the first of this kind, and I could not be more pleased. The first feature that I like is the wide opening of the feeder to put your hummingbird nectar in. No more funnels required. Second, I like that it has perches for the birds to sit while they feed. Third, I like that the yellow centers bulge outward slightly and have a smaller grid than most, which may help prevent ants and other bugs from entering the feeder. The Feeder has an &#34;ant trough&#34; or moat around the top to prevent ants from getting into the feeder, but on a hot day, the water you put in there won't last an hour, so I'm not sure how helpful that feature will be.The Feeder does come with a packet of nectar, but here's a helpful hint for you. Make your own for just pennies. Use 1/4 cup white sugar to 1 cup of hot water, stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, then allow to cool to room temperature. I make up a quart at a time because I clean and change food frequently. But don't waste your money buying pre-made nectar packets that include red dyes that are probably not good for the birds anyway. Make your own once a week and your birds will be as happy as mine.Overall, an excellent feeder! I highly recommend."
1663,493,5,My husband has been using these in our shed where the mice have been nesting in my patio furniture and it is working great. So far in only a week we have killed at least two mice.
706,288,3,I was hoping that I had found an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive suet cakes available locally but these are just not very well made. They are mushy and flaky. Also they don't seem to attract the birds as well as other suet cakes that I have purchased in the past.
1268,874,4,"This is a very clever little kit - very easy to use, with a nice selection of seeds.  Overall it is incredibly convenient and easy, but quite expensive for what you get."
865,516,5,"We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.We cleaned the feeders, purchased this Songbird clear hummingbird food, and set the feeder out on our front porch. This mix is easy to prepare and that is nice when we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning.When nothing really happened for the first few days, we were initially a bit disappointed. However, after two more days we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating."
7,951,5,These tongs were provided to me by Fresher Products Limited and I am in LOVE!!!! The long handle with the wooden inserts are perfectly designed to keep your fingers cool why cooking on the grill. We be purchasing another pair soon for a family member!
197,381,3,I bought this cover to replace a good cover that lasted for years.  I got this one because it was cheap.  It's very thin vinyl.  I don't think it will last very long.  When this wears out it will be time to get a new grill
199,176,5,Have used this shovel on several projects and it's held up pretty well.  Lightweight but sturdy and can handle lots of weight and digging.  Very well made from a great company - Fiskars does not disappoint!
1466,713,2,"This is effective enough for killing mice, but it's a threat to pets, especially cats.  Kids are less likely to get into the product, but it's not really worth the chance.  However, if your home is pet free and kid free, but has a mouse population, this will work well."
501,827,4,"This really livened up the look of my weathered cedar planters. Although they are only a year old, spending all that time in the sun didn&#8217;t do wonders for my poor cedar&#8217;s complexion. Since they are used for herbs, I didn&#8217;t want to use traditional stain or waterproofing. This product fit the bill very well.Application is the same as with any stain. Just clean the surface first, then apply with a brush or rag. I went for the rag approach since the consistency is rather runny and a rag seemed to offer the best chance of limiting a mess in the garage.It really livens up the look of weathered cedar. It&#8217;s not as good looking as it was when new, but the difference is very nice. Wish I had applied this earlier to stave off the weathering.There are two big downsides: cost and smell. The cost is prohibitive for laying in a supply that&#8217;s enough to treat a large raised bed. As it is, I went through about 1/4 of the bottle for just one planter. There&#8217;s no way I would be willing to spend the money to get a gallon of this stuff. The other issue is the smell. I applied it in a garage since the weather was not all that great, but next time this is definitely going to be an outdoor project. Not nose friendly!Works well and is certainly worth a look for small-scale applications."
1447,601,5,"I have weeds that recur in the flower beds.  It's such a chore to keep squatting over the weeds and pulling them by hand.  This device saves time and my back from hurting.All one has to do is place the spikes around the root of the weed, step on the base, and lean it back.  A release pushes the weed off of the teeth, and then you're back on track.  This works extremely well for mulch beds and even conventional lawns.  I tried it along my Pond, and the rocks/clay keep me from getting purchase into the soil.  It doesn't work as well for narrow based weeds but it does for wider based plants like dandelions.This is suitable for light duty work and softer or more aerated areas.Overall, I'm pleased.  I still break a sweat but I just don't break my back.Two thumbs up!"
1162,231,5,"I ordered this Fiskars Big Grip Garden Knife to add to the bucket of go to garden tools.  It is a strong tool which combines knife, saw, weeder and spade into one tool.  The heavy galvanized coating and heavy rubber tool handle with a cord strap to hang, is as good as I have.  I refuse to buy expensive garden tools, as almost any tool can be used to do most work.  Even a claw hammer as needed to dig out a hole.  This tool is probably the best of all worlds.  It should last the life of your desire to do gardening.  I love it."
1410,577,3,"This mousetrap is basically a regular old fashioned mouse trap within a plastic casing.  This mousetrap is good if you are grossed out by the ""trapped"" dead mouse and/or want to keep it contained to avoid seeping or a bloody mess anywhere, it also keeps the dead mouse away from pets, children or anyone at all.  The dead mouse is inside the plastic casing you you just toss the whole thing away. Very easy, clean and as sanitary as a mousetrap can be.  It is a bit of a waste of plastic and I don't know if these can be recycled, but if you are looking for a sanitary way to trap a mouse and an easy disposal, this trap is for you."
1416,765,4,"I've only used two tillers.  Gas powered and this Black & Decker Electric.  I like the design.  The top is a container that you can remove from the unit and fill with sand to weigh it down.  I like the fact that it is removable since you may wish to dump the sand.  Set up was very easy.  All you need is a crescent wrench.  Although even with the sand, it still is not as heavy as a gas powered unit.  When I worked on seeding a new lawn I used a gas powered which was similar in size to this one.  It worked very well.  I used this unit to break up soil for new sod to be laid.  The ground was pretty hard and even with sand, the Black and Decker model didn't seem to ""cut"" into the soil as easy.  I had to stay in one spot for a few seconds and move it around for the soil to get broken up.The only thing I thought could've been better was the mechanism for the trigger.  When you turn on the unit, you lift the lever and it rests against the handle in your right hand.  At times it felt that the trigger may break because of the twisting.  Although it didn't, it still felt as if it would.It is fully adjustable.  You can adjust the unit in three positions depending on how deep you want to go and the height of the handle in relations to your height.The only two things I think could be better was the weight of the unit and the on-off switch.  Also, the extension cord would need to go through an opening under the handle.  However, on the extension cord I used, it was a three pronged plug and it wouldn't fit in the hole.  Even though this unit is only a two pronged, which I thought was weird that there was no ground.This electric unit is great for small to medium jobs."
1386,421,5,This filter is the perfect fit for my Toro mower.  I change it every season.  Keeps the oil clean.  Easy to replace.
1058,272,4,".This is a pretty big feeder, it will hold about half the bag of PUBLIX CARDINAL MIX at one filling.The only glitch is that there is no lock-down mechanism to keep the inevitable Sciurus carolinensis intrusions from attempting entry by lifting the lid...BUT, the good news is, they can try all they want and, so far as I can see, no dice... [It's just annoying to see the lid slightly askew...]The cardinals, chickadees and tom tits absolutely love the thing and the circular design seems to keep squabbles to a minimum.Highly recommend if you really like the redbirds!PS--- There's a place called TRACTOR SUPPLY that has the best price on ""cardinal mix"" which is sunflower and safflower seed mixed about 75/25%. If you have been disappointed in your feeder action, try that stuff from either PUBLIX or TRACTOR SUPPLY, or buy the really big bags and mix your own."
96,878,4,"I keep the Rat Zapper Ultra Rodent Trap in my garage, and it is a bit overkill as I only get small field mice. But it does work with a couple issues.The trap is difficult to clean. If you get the mouse soon after death you only have a few fluids to clean up but it takes getting your arm deep into the traps opening which is difficult.If you wait too long then you have to clean up a stuck dried mouse, fur, etc. not easy.Also baiting is just smearing stuff on a panel that is not easy to clean.I would like to see the end panel removeable with a cup pressed out of the vents in the metal so bait didn't drip, was protected from being eaten from the outside, and could be washed with hot water.Also with the end panel removeable I could get in and clean it easier as the mess is on the closed side which is difficult to reach all the way through the after large foot long device.Finally no luck with batteries on this device, I have to replace much more often than 30 kills, typically 5. Since I use it in the garage I would like to hook it up to a power supply and just plug it in."
273,633,5,I purchased this pot to plant my large house plant in it.  I was so pleased with the color and the design of the pot.  The color is a very rich chocolate brown just what I expected. My plant is out doors for the summer because it looks so nice on my front porch.  I am very impressed with this pot.  I would purchase more in different sizes.
1105,761,3,"We have a lot of mole holes through our yard, living so close to the woods it is hard to get rid of them.  The Deadset mole trap seems like a great idea and design, but I have yet to actually get a mole.You have to make sure that the tunnel is an active tunnel by poking a hole in the to and coming back in 24 hrs to see if the hole is closed.  If it is then your tunnel is active.  You then poke your trap spears into the hole and raise and lower them several times to be sure they can move freely in the soil.  Then pull your handle up and set it.The handle is a little bit difficult to get to stay up in the ready to go position, but can be done if you are careful.  I will update this review if I ever do get any moles.  It has only been 2 weeks so far, I haven't given up hope yet!"
1623,851,1,"I was so excited to receive this hummingbird feeder. It holds a generous amount of water, the bottle is so attractive, and it easily comes apart for cleaning. However, the birds do not drink from it, at all. After a week of no interest from the birds, we put the nectar from this bottle into another one of our feeders that the hummers drink from all the time, and they wouldn't drink it from that bottle either. I have to agree with other reviewers that there is something about the galvanized bottom of this feeder that repels the hummingbirds. Very sadly, we threw out this feeder. It's no good at all."
1004,387,5,"First the obvious... this thing is magical in how it gets coals to light.  The description and majority of other comments are dead on; two pieces of newspaper in the bottom, coals in the top, set it down on your grill grate, light the paper (one match), and in 10 to 15 minutes the coals are blazing red hot!Implied is that you don't have to bother with charcoal lighter fluid or self-lighting coals.  That stuff smells bad and can't do anything to make barbecuing any healthier.  Similarly, having a flammable liquid near your grill can't make things safer.  :)One additional benefit (not that you need more reasons to get one of these) is that it allows you to use a consistent amount of coals each time.  That means consistent heat and consistent results.  Sure, you can ""eyeball it"" but with this you don't have to bother.I just wish I had got this sooner.  The saving in lighter fluid alone would have paid for the chimney and I could have avoided the petroleum smell."
0,531,5,These are quality skewers. I use them primarily for shrimp and they do an excellent job. The ends are sharp enough to pierce the shrimp with little effort. The design keeps the shrimp from falling off. There is a small coin-shaped disk that can be used to help with removal of the food.They work equally well for other types of food. These are the best skewers I have ever used.
1621,821,5,"The main advantage to this awesome trap is the ease in setting and how safe it is for both your fingers and your pet's.  We were sorely needing a mouse trap in our barn but I was worried about having a ""normal"" snappy trap around our chickens... don't want to catch a bird instead of a mouse!  So this one REALLY worked great where we had other animals.  And you don't have to wince while setting it, waiting for it to snap on your fingers (or at least scare you).  The trapping aspect is really easy, you just put a tad bit of peanut butter inside in the spot labeled for it and you are pretty much set.  Set it in a place behind some furniture or another mouse runway (think darker, along the edge of the wall, more protected) and you will have excellent results.  It works great and protects my various livestock, so this is definitely a keeper!"
1309,79,5,"This tool works very well.  And at this price, it is a no brainer. I use this on my St. Augustine grass and it cuts it close. I love the bump feature to release more string. It is also very light and quiet.Just buy an appropriate extension cord and you are good to go. Nothing to charge and it does not use gas, so it does no pollute."
1550,924,5,"As soon as this feeder arrived, I fastened it to the surface of a wooden fence underneath a large forsythia. Because it's flat on one side, a nail is all you need.  This bush is a favored hangout for a number of smaller birds in the neighborhood--primarily sparrows and siskins.  The fact that this feeder is so close to safety really made the difference for these birds.  It took little more than a day for the feeder to be emptied.  I don't know if Perky-Pet makes a bigger one, but we could sure use it around here."
322,30,5,"Easy to assemble, though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio.  But then again, i rarely have to move the grill so it's not like it's a big deal.  The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash-catching compartment on the bottom.  Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane"
501,617,5,"I've been using Spectracide and Ortho for a while, and both are pretty effective. The Spectacide seems to require fewer applications than the Ortho, but it's a pretty close call. Both require that you dilute the product properly based on the type of grass you have. Too strong a dose and you'll end up killing not only the weeds, but the grass too. Too weak and the weeds just shrug it off.I use this for spot treatments and apply it with a pump sprayer. Simple and quick process in the spring and fall to keep the weeds at bay.I usually decide on which to get based on price. Ortho has gone up recently, so I've been using Spectacide. I normally get it at the orange vest big box store, but happened to notice that the version they carried only covers up to 5,000 square feet. This one from Amazon covers up to 16,000 square feet (variation on coverage depends on whether you use it at a 1 tablespoon per gallon or a 2 tablespoon per gallon dilution). Both are 32 ounces, but the one from Amazon is more concentrated.While the price is about the same, the more than double the coverage makes this version from Amazon a much better value. Highly recommend."
1257,253,5,"After pricing over 20 benches, I landed on this one as my choice. It looked great online and the price was lower than smaller benches I'd seen in stores. Still, it's always a little iffy buying something online, so I was a bit skeptical.This bench is beautiful and strong.  Mine was packed really well: despite a corner of the box getting crushed, it came in without a scratch.  Easy to build: took me about 15 minutes and that was moving slow due to the heat. The bolt/cam construction is simple enough for a child to figure out. Very sturdy: easily could hold three adults weighing under 190 pounds each.All in all, it's a great find and I have no trouble giving this product 5 stars!"
812,387,5,I am serious about BBQ and do not use lighter fluids to ruin the taste of the meat. Therefore I use a charcoal chimney. I have used the cheap models and only get a single season from it. Got this one and it looks like it will last years to come. Well worth it.
1646,838,4,"I have not yet had any issues with this hose - it does expand as they say it will and I expected it would get stretched out and never contract back but so far it does seem to contract once it is empty of water.  I like the carrying case that came with it as a nice, easy way to store it out of season.  I'm not crazy about the bright color but it does make it easy to see so there is no danger of mowing over it, which I suppose is the reason they went with a bright color."
47,762,5,"These little vine clips are great.  They are very easy to use to one handed when you need to clip your vine to your plant structure for support.  At the company website, they also point out that the clips are pressure sensitive, so if a vine grows large, rather than damaging the vine, the clip will eventually pop open so your plant remains unharmed.  My concern would be then how would I find this lovely green clips amongst my green garden foliage? So, I give it high marks for ease of use and definitely looks, but I think there is a high potential for loss in the garden which could get pricey."
1327,832,4,"The package says this should be applied once a month.  It worked well for a week, and then I had to re-apply it.  So why do I give it 4 stars?  It smells nice!  My dogs actually like the way it smells and even licked where I spilled it on my arm!  I have tried lots of products to get rid of the robo-bunnies in my development that chomp on my plants immediately after I put them in or as soon as they pop their heads out of the dirt.  This one smells better than anything else I have tried and it works, it just has to be re-applied liberally and often!!!"
1190,607,4,both of these pillows have worked out well in closing the pool. just the right pitch for draining the rain and the coming snow. Should do the job fine....
1620,650,5,"I decided to give everyone flowers for Easter this year so started VERY early with flowers and this comes with peat pellets and a clear lid. Just add water, your seeds and I also recommend a heat mat for under it & your seeds will sprout and grow very fast."
231,286,5,"Almost before we could walk away from the feeders, the birds came and feasted on them. The convenience of having these heavy bags of seeds delivered to our door is a true blessing. The bags are heavy. The seed assortment is great and have attracted mourning doves, cardinals, finches, and other birds we have yet to identify. The feders give pleasure to the birds and provide us with nature's entertainment."
847,167,3,"Well, I am once again reminded that there are no miracles cures to keep animals from eating (hold your breath) ANIMAL FOOD--otherwise known as my landscaping!I try to have a sense of humor about the constant tug and pull of loving wildlife AND my beautiful flowers and shrubs.After spending a lot of time and money trying all manner of products and techniques to have both wildlife AND said greenery, I am finally yielding to the wildlife.This product will likely be my last attempt to keep the critters away.  The Havahart worked okay for a few days on a few areas of the yard.  The cost and time it would take to consistently protect all of your landscaping would be insane.  You would have to spray A LOT and repeatedly and this is just not cost effective.  In addition, I'm not sure the results are any better than a home-brewed garlic/red pepper spray you could create for pennies.I will say that I was surprised that a rogue gang of armadillos that had created severe damage in my lawn were evidentally extremely turned off by the Havahart.  We had trapped one and evidently the others were savvy to the trap.  We put this all around the areas they were burrowing and haven't seen the remainder of the gang since.The time-honored technique of enjoying venison stew and smothered rabbit isn't an option in my suburban neighborhood, but it is most definitely the ONLY technique I know of that allows absolute perfection in your garden and landscaping.  The second best is to do some type of repellant (I'll stick to garlic/red pepper brew) and hope your neighbors leave their yards unprotected and full of more delicious plantings than yours."
40,691,4,"Needed something to handle limbs in trees and this works well. Gives the needed height and easy to start use. For me it did get a little heavy and awkward handling, but with more use I'm sure that will not be a problem."
784,490,1,"I was actually excited to try this.I have a house on my property that has not been lived in for over 5 years, sothere are mice in there.I have tried regular mice traps with better success then this one.Put two of these traps in the house. One on the kitchen counter, one on the floor.I used Skippy peanut butter, as themice like that better then the kind I grind at the market.But after a week of leaving this mouse trap in the house for almost two week,Not one mouse bothered with this trap!I can see mouse pooped, but NO Mouse in the trap, or tried to get in!!!Needless to say, I'm disapointed, and now going to try those plug in things,and use the old type of wood mouse traps.Sorry I could not give a more positive review.I'am going to give this another try, and if it works, I will be back to update this review."
20,651,5,"I thought I was ordering the larger peat pellets more suitable for tomato and bean seeds.  Instead, these are the smaller ones more suitable for smaller seeds, measuring around 1.5"" across.  But that is OK because these work great for germination sets and later transplants and I use smaller sizes, too.  When these are saturated with water the peat inside the mesh holds for the duration of the root growing period.I use aluminum baking pans with clear plastic lids as mini greenhouses.  These are a lot cheaper than those plastic germination sets for sale everywhere.This product is made in Canada."
968,489,1,"I wish I hand read the reviews here before I sunk my hard earned cash into this product.  To be quite frank it is absolutely worthless.  I actually have absolutely nothing against wasps, hornets and yellow jackets but they freak my nieces and newphews out when they visit.After placeing these around the outside of the house the stinging insects seemed to completely ignore them and went upon doing what every these critters do...eating and mating I suppose.Anyway, I will not be buying these again."
1466,714,3,This is best to use in a garage or shed since it's not pet resistant.  It does work and is one of the more effective Tomcat products.
233,754,2,"I dislike leaving a negative review if I'm not 100% sure its not my fault but here goes.  We live in a completely wooded area and with fall here the mice are moving into our pole barn and garage.  We keep 4-5 traps out at all times, currently Victor Quick Set or Tomcat ""jaw"" traps.  Decided to try these.Set-up took a little while, when doing it the first time it takes a while to figure out and even then the ring or ""noose"" keeps flying off, took me five tries the first time.  Be careful opening the package or the rings will fall all over the place.  When setting these on the floor the first thing I noticed is they have to be parrallel to the wall (no way it can work if the ring side is facing a wall) which means the mouse has to come from one side for the trap to work, unlike a jaws trap where the mouse can come from right or left.After being out a while we found the ring gone, droppings on the peanut butter bait but no mouse, happened twice.  A search of the area found no mice, so don't know if the mice were not trapped or crawled away to die.While the design is different it seems to have problems.  Hard to set-up, needs replacement rings (20 rings for $7.99 or 39 cents a ring, to be fair the Victor Quick Set trap mechanism seems to break often) and the mouse is not trapped but can wander off it seems like.  My wife hates the idea of the mouse not being attached to the trap and just laying somewhere and we need gloves or whatever to pick it up versus a jaw trap where you just open the jaws and it drops out.  Finally, it may sound dumb, but snap traps do seem more humane and kill quick and clean, usually, instead of strangling the mouse to death."
162,329,5,"Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas."
659,809,4,"These granules work fine. They are like fertilizer and they spread easy. It says you can use a spreader or hand and I just usedmy hand.  We tried a spray version and I think I like the granules better as it's easier to see how much we are using.  The big test is, though, is if this makes the gophers go away.  So far, we haven't seen any more activity.  Fingers crossed!  These little creatures can destroy a yard."
1224,343,5,"As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers."

879,239,4,"This trap is dangerous....and not only for mice!It's a slightly better design than the all wood and wire cheapies that spring either when you look at them, or not at all.It's easy to smear peanut butter on the plastic 'cheese' holes, but be careful setting the trap. Right now my middle finger has a blood blister from getting caught as it snapped while getting the stabilizing bar in the right position.I'm not complaining too much, however, as it shows that it snaps with enough force to kill quick and clean. Probably more humane than poison."

1028,577,1,"These traps are basically trash. They're difficult to set, can't catch a mouse in an infested house, and are triggered by a bump really easily -- and can't be reset once triggered.My boyfriend left a milk crate of food on his kitchen floor. The mice found it. For weeks they ate and played, leaving their treats all over the kitchen. He caught something like a dozen of them using traditional traps before I got these and persuaded him to try them out. Nothing. Nothing. NO DEAD MICE for 2 weeks. He tried to move one of the traps, it tripped, and was then completely useless. He finally gave up on these, and put the regular traps out again. Lo and behold, a mouse a day!I have to admit, my initial reaction to these was that they were kind of ridiculous, but I'm way less germophobic than your average American, so I was prepared to give them a ""well, if you'd rather throw away a silly amount of plastic than see a dead mouse, I guess they're okay"" kind of review. But given that they don't work, I don't even have to touch on how wasteful they are in order to issue a resoundingly negative review.I mean, seriously, there were so many mice in that house that I think I might have had better luck with my bare hands than with these traps. I didn't try that, though, because that is too gross, even for me."
1202,904,5,"The ingredient list is highly tailored to pansies.  Pansies have unique needs as they are fantastic for fall landscapes, come in many colors and varieties, and are a highly adaptable annual.The nitrogen mix is probably ideal for pansies, which need nitrogen throughout the year including winter.  The iron percentage, 1%, is correct.  Pansies also need manganese and potassium carbonate is good for them - all listed and guaranteed ingredients.One recommendation is to get the soil tested.  Pansies do best in pH 5.4 to 5.8."
654,787,4,"Interesting! The week whacker came in an obviously pre-opened package and I was expecting grass and dirt but all contents looked untouched and new. Instructions were reasonably easy to follow; however the description, and even the mention of the wall bracket was missing from the printed copy and at first I wondered what that part was for. However, I figured it out and confirmed it when I downloaded the manual from the Toro Site. Also, there is nothing in the instructions which tells me which of two possible orientations to install the wire edge guide so I guess I have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. I first installed it with the end pointing down but changed it to point upwards after using it for a while. I see the cost of battery replacement is very high...almost 70% of the cost of the trimmer itself. Hope it lasts for a while. I usually like to keep one or more spare batteries fully charged for the inevitable dead battery experience but not this time...not at those prices.I used it once on my yard, a small lot of about 150 x 60 less the house, with trimming all around both the house and the fence on three sides and gardens. I also used the &#34;edger&#34; mode for the drive, front of the house and the rear patio. This is not really an edger with a blade and all, just the whacker turned 90 degrees so it whacks vertically so it doesn't really do what a blade would do but it''s okay for my purposes. Hard to guide straightly, however, even with the wheel so the edge is somewhat ragged. Having said that, I whacked for about an hour on low power setting (really a blade movement which takes off about an inch of the end of the cord) and still had more to go. Nice not to have fuel fumes or a long cord to deal with.Am reasonably satisfied with this item and would recommend it to a friend."

1152,47,5,"This is the first Axe I have ever owned. (Not the first axe I have ever used.)  I am very pleased with it.  At first the head seemed to make the axe feel off balance and heavy, but as I got to using it, it helped get momentum building to make splitting the wood almost effortless."
1271,245,3,"This is a very inexpensive sprinkler head. The Rain Bird works well in the short radius range. It gets everything covered out about 24 feet with reasonable even water coverage. If it is adjusted to a larger radius, it tends to put most of the water out near the outer perimeter and close to the sprinkler. Not very much water falls in the middle area. Since I wasn't really looking to pay much and don't need a very wide coverage it works for me. If you need a large area covered evenly, I suggest a better sprinkler."
1467,3,5,"Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get ""prettier"" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if ""pretty"" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a ""lock on"" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no ""medium"" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual ""problem"", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is ""too good""---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a ""closed"" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then ""open 'er up"" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT ""Gilmour 572TF"".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in ""bargain bin"" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a ""Gilmour 572TF"", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the ""Gilmour 572TF"", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those ""prettier"" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in ""bargain bins"", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a ""pretty"" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will ""sacrifice"" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) ""pretty"" sprayer nozzles, which have ""fallen out of favor"" for various reasons."
504,231,5,"Fiskars Big Grip Garden Knife #7079My wife & I have used this knife (digger) many times to remove weeds from the lawn and garden.

573,167,4,"When you get critter repellant, you expect it to repel critters.  After the mixed reviews, I was unsure of what to expect, but I decided to give it a shot.The sprayer needed some minor assembly when I received it.  The batteries were already in mine, so all I had to do is stick the hose into the bottle and start spraying.  The only problem I had is that it took longer to prime than I was expecting.  I tried keeping the bottle high and adjusting the nozzle.  Nothing seemed to work.  I opened the bottle to be sure the end of the hose was in the liquid, and it was.  With the top unscrewed, I tried the sprayer again and suddenly fluid was spraying copiously.Because the sprayer is motorized, and sprays quickly, the next part was easy.  Having had experience with insect sprays, which recommend a two foot width to serve as an insect blocker, I sprayed about a two foot width around our cucumbers right after Peter Cottontail had sampled many of our ripe cucumbers.I was annoyed that Peter seemed undeterred by the spray.  He came back to visit the very next day.  However, to my surprise Peter seemed to be much less interested in our cucumbers after his return visit.  Indeed, after his one return visit, he and his relatives seem to be avoiding our cucumbers.Now, the bunny brigade seemed quite enamored of our cucumbers prior to spraying this critter repellant, and suddenly their interest has dropped off to near zero.  Either the bunnies decided the succulent cucumbers were not as yummy as they had previously thought, or this stuff works.  My assumption is that after waltzing through the repellent the bunnies realized that the welcome mat had been removed.Now it is time to focus on our lettuce, which is disappearing about as fast as it grows.Enjoy!"
1203,337,2,I was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings.  The more  openings and parts the more chance for failure.The &#34;flowers&#34;  have to be pushed into holes and then the yellow centers inserted.  The hole you push the flower into is failrly big and  over time the plastic becomes brittle and leakage begins. My hummers seem to like the smaller feeders  ( which are made by Perky Pet)  I think a little more &#34;design tweaking&#34;  is needed. The smaller feeders are simpler but work better.
1093,348,5,"I have one of these that was given to me years ago, and it is still my favorite gardening 'tool'.  The paint still looks pretty good, the hinges still work, and the cushion is still soft on my old knees.  I love that in the kneeling position, the side rails give me help in getting up.  Also, I can quickly flip it over and it's a seat for taking off my shoes or just taking a load off.  I know my green-thumb daughter will love hers."
1162,484,5,"If you know the name Fiskars, then you know their products are quality made and worth the price asked.

I usually recover the price of my Prime membership several times over in a year.  These scissors cut clean and the knife is also sharpe.  The serrated knife edge handles poly and other ropes without much effort.  The little notch in the cutter is for cutting twist wire and light wire.  This is a great tool to have on your belt.

868,47,5,"I bout this after my power company felled a couple trees on my property that were encroaching on power lines. They cut them into 2-3 foot sections (and a couple 6-8 foot sections... thanks a lot!) and left them where they lay. I cut them into standard 16"" sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them (still pretty green) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section, only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter. I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10"" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I'm not a big guy (5'6""), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn't cut my leg off, but that's all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16"" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by ""choking up"" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat. I haven't truly put it through the paces yet, and I haven't had any (major) overstrikes, so I'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it."
1292,312,5,These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
562,291,5,Now this is a great Injector!  The previous one I bought did not work very well but I really recommend this one.  Made my smoked turkey taste great!
467,178,5,"I bought the Alligator Lopper because I need to cut larger branches than my pruner could handle, but I was afraid of the regular chain saws.There were several concerns I had when I ordered the Alligator Lopper.  First, the weight.  I am a woman with weaker than average arms and I was afraid I'd have trouble handling this lopper.  No problem there.  It turns out to be much lighter than I expected.Second, the mechanics.  I wasn't sure if a lot of tinkering would be necessary.  Basically, all I need to do before operating it is tighten the chain with the included wrench (loosen some bolts, it tightens automatically, tighten the bolts) and then add some bar and chain oil (not included).My last concern was whether the cutting action would be too powerful for my arms to handle.  Well, so far, so good.  I can do it!  I cut a bin full of branches this morning and am just waiting for it to be emptied so I can cut some more.  My forearms and hands are a little tired from working muscles I have not worked much before.  Other than that, it was quite easy.I like the safety features.  The chain is covered and I need both hands on separate triggers to turn on the lopper.  An accident from dropping the lopper onto a body part would seem less likely to happen than with a standard chain saw.This was a good investment for me.  My trees are going to look a lot nicer when I'm done with them."
803,763,5,I never can start a gas weed eater so I got this for in use in between when my yard guy comes.  It is very powerful for an electric weed eater and it works very well!
4,917,5,"First, I have to say that this tool is a bit expensive to place in every planter. However, it's very useful for the odd temperamental plant that just doesn't want to behave. I've found, too, that I can move it from plant to plant every couple of weeks or so to monitor more than one. During the summer, I will give it a try outdoors, as well.The iPhone app could use a little streamlining, but it does work well. One has to set it up for each plant, but once a plant has been saved it's can be recalled. Today, the app called for a firmware update to the Flower Power unit, which was done through my iPhone with no hassle. The app also suggested I move my cacti collection to a sunnier window, but that's not an option. However, when the sun finally came in through that window, the app assumed I'd moved it.This sensor is for those who, like me, have difficult locations, especially during the winter, when it's not possible to move plants outside for a little extra sunshine. It is also interesting to see in real time how a plant is faring. I recommend getting a unit if you're concerned about the day-to-day health of your potted plants."
1553,874,3,"I should begin by saying this little set is not a bad idea in and of itself. Heck, this is hardly the first time anyone has introduced a seed kit to the populace and Miracle-Gro is a brand I highly respect.  So little seedpods in their individual biodegradable containers with food ready-to-go should have been a hit, right?  Yet I found myself, even while planting them, thinking ""why?""The plants grew about as well as I could hope for, but I could see no difference between them and more traditionally-sewn plants, nor was the containers significantly more convenient.  The same amount of energy and work goes to setting these up than any other seedling or seen, and this kit just costs so darn much.I think I was just excited by the fancy setup, but when all was said and done I would rather go the old-fashioned route.  Kind of fun, perhaps a good gift idea, but not how I would support my gardening full-time."
354,874,3,"As some reviewers have mentioned there is not much in the way of yield to this small gardening tool, but it is fun and a good to get your feet wet in gardening.  It seems more like a science kit to get someone started.  It is fun and it avoids much of the mess of gardening.  No it is not going to replace many trips to the grocery store, but its concept has some merit, primarily to get more folks involved in raising their own vegetables."
1611,47,5,"This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs."
1130,949,5,This product has many uses and I love it. The quality and durability make it a great addition for my home. You can use this with the grill and while baking for some amazing basting goodness.
372,44,5,I used this product to trim shrub and tree branches around my yard. I can easily carry it around the yard because it is the perfect length and is light weight. I will also note that the blades are sharp and pinch through branches with ease. The Fiskars trimmer is a great addition to any garden cart especially if you want a quality trimmer for all your yard work needs.
906,838,2,"Update - July 4th, 2014.After using it for about the twentieth time over the course of LESS than a year, the internal rubber hose portion ripped in two and water went everywhere. My three star rating is now a two star rating. Reason being, for the short period of time it was used it was nice not having to drag a larger and heavy hose around. Durability is definitely an issue and I would not recommend this.I think we've all seen commercials for similar versions of this expanding hose and thought  ""what a neat idea..."". And if you're like me, you're extremely skeptical about the functionality of it. Well I'm surprised to report that this expanding hose is awesome... SO FAR.As it sits it takes up a little less than one cubic foot of space, way less than any regular 75' hose.The hose comes with a ball shutoff valve so that you can close the valve to build up pressure in the hose to make it fully expand. Now here is the issues I have with it. When you open the valve to use the hose, the water pressure decreases enough that the hose starts to contract and get shorter and shorter the longer I used it. And it's not a lack of head pressure at the spigot (we have 40+PSI from our well).Durability... that's still up in the air. This definitely is not a everyday use hose as I can already tell with minimal usage that it's not going to last. This is use only a few times a week hose to water some patio plants sort of hose.For me, I've been using it as a garage hose to wash the cars with since it stores in such a small space and I only have to/get to use it a few times a month.So at the end of the day this is NOT a replacement hose for gardening, lawn, or any other daily use hose."
1013,377,3,"I thought this would solve all my problems.  The traditional brushes seem to ""waste"" a lot of their surface area in that the bristles on the leading edge get squashed down pretty quickly and you end up using the wood (or in some cases) plastic to smear things around.  This looked like it would not have that problem.  But the bristle density leaves a lot to be desired and they tend to get squashed very easily.  I don't think this is any better, or in fairness, any worse than the traditional design.  I do find that I miss the metal scraper part that is found on traditional brushes, especially if it has the little cut out on the side to scrape each individual ""rung"" of the grate.  So I'll keep using this until it doesn't work but I doubt I'll get another after that."
1563,199,5,"This is not an axe for splitting large logs, although it could handle moderately sized logs just fine.  It may sound like paranoia, but we live on an island, and so one reason I bought this is to keep it in the attic.  After hearing about hurricanes that have trapped folks in their homes for lack of a way to get out of an attic, I thought it better safe than sorry to have one one hand should the need ever arise.  I don't do a lot of splitting of wood here.The weight feel good and well balanced, and the flare on the handle makes the likelihood of letting if slip out of my hand unlikely.  I'm pleased with this axe for the value, and have always been impressed with Fiskars products."
1646,792,5,"This is a really cute little waterer for wild birds.  Shaped like one of the 5-gallon water bottles you find on a water cooler, the idea is to put out water on hot summer days for the wild birds who might struggle to find some.  They will be more attracted to stick around if you have both a feeder for them AND a source of water.  While I don't doubt that, in my area there is no shortage of water available for the wild birds, so I didn't need it for that.  Instead I decided to try it for when I am raising chicks - I am always looking for a better way to supply water to them.What I like about this:* the hanging loop is solid and thick enough to support the weight even when the bottle is full of water.  I really like being able to hang the waterer as it keeps the chicks from kicking their food into it, and I can raise it up as they grow* the bottle screws into the base very securely so I don't need to worry about it coming loose if chicks add their own weight by standing on it.  It actually needs to be screwed on and off for quite a few turns - not just half a turn as is so often the case, so I was very pleased with that* the carry handle.  My husband immediately picked it up and said the handle was a ridiculous waste of space and plastic, but the difference between us is that he has huge hands that can easily pick up the full bottle, holding it by the top, and transport it where he wants to go.  My small hands can not accomplish this, so the handle is invaluable to me (I wish they put this on the waterers sold as chick waterers!)The only negative FOR MY USAGE is that the bowl is quite shallow.  For wild birds - i.e, using it for its intended purpose - I'm sure the shallow bowl is fine.  For me it is working but if it were deeper, I'd be even happier.  However since I am using it for a different purpose than intended, I did not feel that warrants removing a star from the rating.  Overall, I am very pleased with this and do recommend it."
1232,897,5,"We got this bird feeder because we are always looking for something new and different to attract wildlife to our back porch.  The design is unlike any of our other bird feeders, and the requirement of filling it with only large seed (smaller seeds, and even large ones, fall right through) promised to attract a different sub set of birds than we are used to.Filling is easy, as the top has just one button that frees it to slide along the hanger wire. Pouring in the black oil sunflower seeds was straightforward, but I recommend putting it on a flat solid surface to limit the amount of seed that falls out while filling. (There&#8217;s going to be a lot of leakage, anyway, so make sure you fill it outside in the vicinity of where it will be hung.) Once it was up, it was only a matter of a day or so before the birds found it and started using it. Lots of finches, grosbeaks, sparrows and cardinals use both of the fly through holes and the sides of the feeder. Mourning doves tend to hang out on the ground and eat what drops down. Several smaller birds spent many minutes sitting on the inside, eating. The most common behavior seems to be for the birds to sit in one of the holes and eat seeds from the outside of the feeder by sticking their head out. After two days, we noticed the birds came and went in waves based on our activity, however, this feeder attracts a lot of birds and has caused them to largely ignore our multi-seed feeder. The feeder was more than half empty in just three days. Also, I haven&#8217;t seen a single bird get caught or hung up in the feeder like other reviewers have mentioned.Because this feeder is all metal, I expect it will last a good while. It is well designed, and visually interesting. It does dump a lot of seed during the filling process, but most feeders do. Based on the large number of birds it attracts and the overall ease of use, I give it a full five stars."
1149,842,4,It`s still too early to have a solid verdict about the product`s overall efficacy.  But the geranium roots that usually rot when I try to grow plants from cuttings did not rot after being dipped in this stuff. Will they actually take root and grow?  Stay tuned...
582,251,5,"I own two cats and recently purchased a property in a wooded area. The first time I went to the property to look at it I noticed ant traps  placed randomly inside the house with a line of ants comically walking right past the traps so when I got my Safer Diatomaceous Earth Powder, I was excited to give it a try. I placed the powder in the openings by all the base boards. Application was effortless and not at all messy. I wasn't worried about the Cats because of what I know about how Diatomaceous Powder works. In a phrase, the evidence of ants was remarkably gone within the first three days. Since then, I've surrounded the house with this and made sure to get the seams that would be hard to get. My realtor noticed the absence of ant traps and we laughed that after all my hard decorating and moving, THAT is what she noticed. But hey, when you think about it, that's a pretty big deal!"
125,932,5,"I love the glass humming bird feeders. They last and last from year to year and are so easy to refill and clean. I like that it has 4 stations to feed from instead of just 3 as I get a lot of hummers here. Unlike the plastic ones, it screws on tight each time even over time instead of wearing out and not sealing right and dripping like the plastic ones. The last glass one I got of this same brand,was 7 years ago and it still works like new so I was thrilled to get another glass one. So happy to have it and just in time as they'll be here any day now. Already saw a Baltimore Oriole and the hummers are usually just days behind. Hurry and get this as glass feeders go fast and worth every penny."
1269,213,5,I really like this Victor M2524. It does the job. The LiL light blinks and you know right off you have a kill.
559,939,3,"This feeder is okay. It's similar to other Perky Pet models, but it is just a little too small to be worth the effort. If you want to be filling it up pretty frequently, by all means go ahead and get it, but otherwise it's easier to just get something a little bigger and not have to worry about refilling as often."
1545,66,3,We have some pretty fat squirrels in our yard that have managed to get into every bird feeder we have.  It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.  How pissed would you be if you bought this filled and hanged it and it fell and cracked the tube?!
1640,167,3,"I used this Havahart Deer Off at a family cemetery plot location in a remoted wooded area at the edge of town.  We have several family members buried there.  It's a beautiful spot, but one cannot put out fresh flowers, as the deer will eat them all, completely, each night.Application process was straightforward, wetting down the flowers per directions.  The powered sprayer provided a nice adjustable stream/mist.  This powered pump is of course much easier to use than a typical squeeze handle sprayer bottle.  However, I'm not sure it's that much more convenient than a pump up pressure sprayer (which don't need batteries and provide higher capacities . . . in the multi-gallons).  But for wetting down a few plants or flowers, this was easy, quick, and convenient.Results:  I definitely got results, as (checking back after 2 nights) not all of the flowers had gotten eaten.  But, SOME flowers (both blooms and greenery) were munched and gone - maybe about half.Maybe another application will help.  I'll do that and re-edit this review if and when my results improve. At this point, I can't really recommend this repellent on the hope that half of your plants will survive."
372,84,5,"I use this shears for trimming grass around my landscaped flower bed in the front lawn. It is hard to mow around the bricks, so this shears comes in very handy. I love the fact that the handle/head can swivel and it is so light weight. Also, as with all the Fiskars blade products, the blades are very sharp and I am able to trim precisely what I want. A great product to trim the grass around areas the lawn mower can't reach."
189,908,4,*I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for this review in any way*I had never used a meat injector prior to this one. I was a little uncertain about how it works and just what to do with it. But this was simple to use and also I really liked that it was easy to clean.
911,869,3,"This is SUCH a great idea!  The solar power, the reservoir, etc.  And it works--mostly.The first few days, we noticed that the reservoir emptied right away, and I had an animal repellent surrounded by bunnies.  (I was going to post a picture of that--it's hilarious!)  We were shocked that it emptied so quickly--but realized that when the sprinklers came on, it sensed the water and sprayed over and over again until it emptied.  Since the sprinklers run 2-3 times a day here, that emptied super fast...Once we adjusted the sensitivity, it has been fine...so be aware--if it's emptying quickly, check that your sprinklers aren't activating the repellent.I do wish it had a continuous water source capability.  Just a float with a hose attachment.  That would make this perfect.As it is, it has indeed kept the bunnies off of the grass.  (Once we figured out the emptying problem.)I would have given it 5 stars if it had an option to hook up an external water source.  We went out of town for 4 days and it was empty when we got home, and bunny poo all over the lawn.  There was nothing we could do about that."
1664,729,4,"I didn't use this with the pressure washer, but got good results with the hose. Only noticed one issue.  I mixed the solution in a spray bottle half and half with water.  When I did that I noticed that while there was no odor, the back of my nose felt dry and uncomfortable as though I'd breathed in paint fumes.  It didn't last too long and I wasn't even sure it came from this product until I used it again.I have used other Krud Kutter products and like them because I can clean the red dirt stains off the house and even off my tennis shoes.  I was eager to try this because it supposedly keeps mold from returning to the siding.  One part of my house is shaded and every year is greenish.  While I can go a few years between washings on the rest of the house, that part needs attention every year.While I expect to try the product out in other ways, this time I just hand-sprayed the siding with the diluted product, no prewetting or other prep.  I then went to uncoil the hose and turn it on and got sidetracked with another small chore so I returned to the sprayed siding about 5 minutes later.  I just sprayed it with the hose using the 'jet' setting on the nozzle and all the green mold  and dirt  washed right off leaving a clean white surface.  The area that had not been sprayed was unchanged  after hosing however.After the siding dried, I sprayed the rest and rinsed and the whole side of the house is now clean.  Time will tell if the mold will return as usual, but I'd sure be happy if it stayed away on the treated part for a couple of years.  The plants below the sprayed area don't look any the worse for wear at the moment and I didn't even rinse them off since they are not anything I care about plus I'm curious to see the effects after a couple of days, before using the product on other areas where landscaping below does matter.My only objection so far is that I have the nose/throat issue again following use.  I will definitely wear a mask when  using the product again.  It is worth it to note that my dilution was only half and half so I was using the product in a stronger solution than others may have, or than it might come out of a pressure washer.  In my trial the product delivered perfect results and if the mold stays away, I'll buy it again when needed."
1558,882,5,"I had a plastic 2-way hose connector on our back water tap last year.  No surprise that it broke.  Green Thumb was great in sending me detailed instructions on how to loosen up the levers using WD40.  It was worth the time to read those instructions so I recommend you do the same if you order this item.  It is strongly made and I anticipate getting more than one season out of it!  If I don't I will be back to change my rating.  But right now, I am one happy camper!  Great item!"
469,842,5,"I had a container of Schultz Take root, which has an active ingredient of  Indole-3-butyric acid and it turns out that this is a newer version (with a greener looking label). Indole-3-butyric acid is a synthetic version of Indole acetic acid which is found in plants and helps with cell division.  The rest of this product is probably some form of talc, to ease application.  I did read an article designed for commercial growers stating that liquid formulations are more effective, but only when mixed correctly and applied in a manner that does not cause cross contamination and should be remixed each time.  Therefore, the suggestion was that for overall powder was more cost effective, but one should be careful when inserting into the growing medium (soil) to make a hole so that the powder is not all rubbed off as you insert it into the soil.Apparently different plants need different amounts (or not at all) rooting hormone.  You can find this article by googling gpnmag and rooting hormones.Two ounces will last you a long, long time.  This is a great way to build up your plant collection from plants you already own or ask your neighbor for a cutting of that rose you admire so much.  My local library let me take some cuttings from a vine I admired (which they were trimming) which I rooted using rooting hormone.  I later saw the same vine at a nursery for fifteen bucks. For the cost of one plant for the jar you can make hundreds of cuttings."
1496,553,4,"Every year, I lose my bok choy to flea beetles.  At first sign of them this year, I used Safer  Brand 3-in-1 and it took care of them right away.My roses tend to get a black spot and yellow leaves, so I've sprayed them well and so far, they've just lost the few leaves that I didn't catch early.  Same goes with my bee balm, so I'm trying the spray on the lower leaves of it as well.My tomatoes have had a fungus for the last few years that I'm told is carried in the soil.  I mulch and remove the lower leaves to keep it under control, but this year, I've also used the 3-in-1 spray.  It may have been a little too warm when I sprayed the tomatoes because it seems to have burned the leaves a little.  They seem to be recovering though. I had the same results with my miniature roses...slight burning of the leaves, but they are recovering too."
1570,875,5,"I have been impressed with my heavy duty Grill Brush. The bristles are strong and make easy work of grill clean up. I prefer to clean the grill right after cooking while it is still hot, and most grill brushes have a short handle, which makes it tough to do without burning your hands. The great thing about this brush is that it has a long, stout handle, which makes it easy to clean the grill while it is still hot, without danger of burning your hands. The cleaning bristles are heavy duty and make quick work of cleaning the grill.I love to grill, and am very pleased with this product. It makes quick, easy, and safe work of cleaning a hot grill.(I was provided a copy of this product for review)"
244,904,5,My parents used to have lovely pansies in their Colorado garden which would last well in to late autumn.  The last few years the pansies they plant have not done as well and after a little research it seems it is probably because the soil no longer has enough nitrogen  This GreenView GreenSmart Enhaced Efficeincy Fertilizer/Pansy Food has enough nitrogen (in the form of nitrates) to sustain the colorful pansy blossoms for many months even in colder weather.  This should really perk up pansy beds.
1507,515,5,"Yes, this is overpriced but if you've ever overfilled your weedwhacker or lawnmower then you know you need this.  I won't happen again and it's one of those products that you just suck it up and buy because it's worth it.  Every other can I've bought has been garbage compared to this."
1418,53,5,"Does not seem to actually capture YJ's, but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20' outside of my veggie garden. Somehow it seems to work. YJ's, hornets, were making nests in the GROUND, in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago...the roots seem to never completely rot, but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys. And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap, nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on. Hope it works there too.Recommend."
0,272,5,"This all metal feeder is easy to fill. I used black sunflower seeds and the birds really enjoy this feeder. Most of the birds are cardinals but other varieties visit as well. Cardinals can put on a very interesting show. For example, yesterday a female was feeding when a male came along and chased her away. She flew down to the ground and apparently signaled to a friend perched in the magnolia tree because both of them flew together back to the feeder and the male chickened out against the two to one ratio and he flew away. Soon he was back with another male and the females decided they better leave. Bird watching can be entertaining and this feeder attracts many birds willing to put on a show in return for their feed. The bird feeder pole is squirrel proof so the squirrels get to eat only the small amount of sunflower seed that falls to the ground. This has been an enjoyable addition to my bird feeder collection and the price was reasonable."
302,918,3,"First, I want to acknowledge that Cutter works--it works very well indeed and is an effective repellant. And where I live in Connecticut the deer-tick population is massive and those ticks carry Lyme disease (which I've had, it's miserable--it settled in my knees) and so I fully understand why people turn to products like Cutter to protect themselves. And I *do* use it myself on rare occasion when I know that I'm in a tick-infested area like a wet marsh or meadow. And yes, Cutter does work and probably as well as any other brand.I'm giving it only three stars, however, because the chemical that makes this product work is DEET which is a much more dangerous chemical than manufacturers would lead us to believe. It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It's far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy ""punks"" in some stores and online and if you're just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I'm not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it's probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that's not just hype, it's far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it."
1067,658,3,"I found that these Coshell Coconut Shell Charcoal Briquettes worked well compared to mainstream brand briquettes, and certainly better than generic or store brand briquettes in terms of evenness, clean-burning, heat, and time span of usable heat. I did not find that they burned any better than any quality brand of all-natural hardwood lump charcoal, nor did they have as good of aroma.I use a Weber chimney starter, with some wadded up newspaper doused in vegetable oil underneath, to get the charcoal going regardless of brand or type. This was a little slower to light than regular briquettes, but not longer than quality hardwood lump charcoal. I found that it burned cleaner, longer and more evenly than the regular briquettes, but again was comparable to quality hardwood lump charcoal. I did find that there was very little smoke/flavor transferred to the food, which is better than transferring a petroleum type flavor from cheap match-light briquettes, but not as good as the smokey goodness transferred from some good quality lump charcoal. All in all, I found this product to be a clean, even burning charcoal, with very little aroma/flavor emitted, which might be a good fuel for a smoker when you can add your choice of wood chips for type and amount of flavoring. The quality from a novel source such as coconut shells was surprising, and it is worth noting that the fuel source is fully renewable (and might have just been thrown in the landfill anyway if it comes from a coconut (food/milk) processing plant. For my tastes, however, it just didn't add that charcoal-grilled quality to the food that a good quality (and comparably priced or cheaper) hardwood lump charcoal does."
1202,773,5,"This is a very efficient high-tech grill.  The heat is concentrated in a diffused 11.25-inch radius circle.  This provides reasonably consistent heat throughout the 365 square inch circle while preventing much of it from escaping, unless used in high winds in which case the heat won't be consistently even and the grill won't necessarily be efficient.  The heat diffuser is unique to Napoleon - it gives efficient distribution of heat.  For its size, the grill is heavy at 62 pounds.The temperature gauge is helpful in several ways including to control the grill temperature at lower heat settings which can make it more efficient and get optimal results with dense foods.  There are low side vents immediately underneath the bowl to control flare-ups.  The instructions indicate that the recommended number of charcoal to use is 50.  There is a charcoal starter that helps a lot prior to cooking.The lid is not just a very large handle that doesn't get hot, but it's located at a 45-degree angle to the hinge, meaning we don't have to open it over the heat.  That impressed me, my neighbors and the UPS guy that sometimes takes his break at my house.  It's actually the first thing people notice about the grill.  Please take a look at the product photo (on the Amazon page) to see how the handle is lined up with the hinge - pretty good.  One can also spin the handle to the other side, so the photo could have shown the handle on the other side too.The bottom assembly is high-gauge and wheels aren't robust, but it probably isn't blowing over because it's so heavy and stands with a fairly low center of gravity.  The company has another assembly called a kettle cart that stands higher and with a real nice side handle and even a folding side shelf that looks practical to me.  The ash catcher (on all PRO22K models) comes out in a simple way, has a handle and can be dumped with ease.The grill itself is interesting.  The grill is cast iron - super heavy, not like a cheap grill at all.  The grill is wavy-design but also with two hinges that can be put to good use for what the company calls ""indirect cooking.""  But the cast iron grill with hinges also makes it possible to add charcoal or move the charcoal around.  Now something interesting is that the grill can be set at 3 different height levels by just picking it up, rotating it in the air and placing it down again - it's a lot higher quality level system than it probably seems by my description.  One needs hot pads to change grill height during cooking.The company is Napoleon Gourmet Grills, a privately-owned Canadian company with 700 employees according to the polite ""Customer Care"" employee - whose last name was actually Napoleon - that called me upon my request made on the contact page of their site.The instructions warn that the finish of the grill will be damaged if water is used to extinguish the coals.  However, the finish is porcelain and is not supposed to peel.  The grill has a limited lifetime warranty and one doesn't have to register one's warranty.  Napoleon also makes parts available since this is an investment compared to the inexpensive grills.Whereas I've described some of the physical features of the grill, I have some experience using it and it does distribute heat evenly on par with a convection oven.  My interaction with the company made me feel confident about the product, to say the least.  As I've stated, the UPS guy and neighbors validated my sense that this is a good grill, to the extent that people can do this while sampling some of the results."
475,779,5,"I like this hose holder, it's nice and sturdy and keep the garden hose nice and tidy, and it looks neat too.A lid is available for this product, but that must be bought seperately."
1140,874,2,"Now that the gardening season is over, i find myself wondering what problem this product is trying to solve. It's such an awkward middle ground between starting seeds and buying started plants - instead of getting a packet of 20 or 200 seeds, you're getting just a few, which one could argue is less wasteful. However, you're starting from seed instead of buying an established plant, so you get all the risks of seed-starting with none of the flexibility to start 10 seeds to make sure you get one viable plant. Further, with the 'tender' plants like tomato and pepper, if you want a harvest at all, you still have to deal with the hassle of starting indoors, and these pods make that quite awkward.And, of course, my criticism of the mix still stands. One pea plant? One bean plant? Even the best harvest will result in a snack's worth of peas. Further, beans and peas like to grow crowded, so a single vine won't do as well as it would with neighbors. Were these products grouped differently, i'd be less critical. Perhaps an herb garden (just the herbs), a cool-season crop mix with the greens and at least half a dozen peas, and a warm-season crop mix with the tomatoes, cucumber, pepper, and at least half a dozen beans. Then at least you wouldn't have a handful of pods sitting around gathering dust between the early planting and the late one, and would actually get enough beans and peas to work with.The biggest problem i had with this kit was that it clearly wasn't designed for Pacific Northwest gardeners. (Ironically, about the only region for which i'd recommend this would be central California, and for reasons unclear it can't be shipped to California.) I planted these side-by-side with varieties suited to this climate, and without exception the local varieties did significantly better than Miracle-Gro's generic seeds. I say generic because they provide absolutely no information, even vital tidbits like whether the tomatoes are determinate or indeterminate, and whether the peas and beans had inoculant on them already. If you adored, say, the cherry tomatoes that grew from this kit, you'd have no way at all to buy more except maybe through Miracle-Gro (or seed-saving, but if you knew how to save seeds you probably wouldn't be buying this kit).Realistically, if you want a small but successful garden, you shouldn't be ordering seeds blindly on the internet. You should find a local garden center (ideally a real one, not the annex on the side of a hardware store) and ask the employees to recommend varieties well suited to your area. There are very few tomato plants that would thrive in both Oregon and Texas. I'm sure Miracle-Gro did its best to find one that would so they could make the product as uniform as possible, but the end result is that gardeners in Texas will probably have horrible blossom end rot on their tomatoes, and we up in the north only had a few tomatoes ripen up before the cold and wet weather started.I think this product is a waste of time, money, material, and effort, and would really like to give it only one star. However, nearly all of my seeds did germinate, and nearly everything gave me at least one nibble or snack. The only duds were the cucumbers, which fell victim to a neighborhood cat, and the bean plant, which got lonely and died before even flowering. But buying two globe tomatoes, a handful of cherry tomatoes, a bell pepper, and a few baby lettuces at the store would cost less than this kit and require no yard space and no watering.(If anyone wants to explain away my troubles and poor harvest with my own ineptitude, i'll defend against that by pointing out that i'm a Certified Master Gardener, and my harvest from my garden this year is more than 350lbs of fruits and vegetables. I provided these pod-plants with the same care and attention as their neighbors.)[What follows is my original review, going through the step-by-step of planting and maintaining.]--Unpacking and Planting--(early June)I can't imagine many experienced gardeners using this product for one major reason: you don't know what you're planting. My local garden center has 99 varieties of tomatoes in stock this month, and those are just the kinds that grow well in this area. The tomato included in this pack is just described as 'globe tomato'. I'm assuming it's going to be a red tomato, because even though you can get tomatoes in any color from nearly-white to nearly-black, people think of tomatoes as red. But it doesn't even say if it's determinate or indeterminate, much less other important details like disease resistance. All we know is that it's a globe tomato and should be ready to start harvesting in about 65 days.The lack of information is dangerous for novice gardeners in different ways. The website says to thin plants after the first set of true leaves appears, but doesn't say what 'true leaves' are. The included information says you can plant these either in the ground or in containers, but gives absolutely zero guidance on what size the containers should be (though they do suggest Miracle-Gro's potting soil mix). A novice who either has their local extension office on speed dial, or is very comfortable with internet searches, can probably find the information they need to have a chance at success with these. (The website appears to still be in development, so they may well add more information as they go. For now, though, it's seriously lacking.)And of course, some of the information is just plain wrong. On the website it advises picking your peas early in the morning, while they're still crisp. But the sugar in peas starts turning to starch almost immediately after harvest, so if you want the sweetest, best-tasting peas, you need to pick them right before you're going to use them. I was also amused by the one-sentence suggestion of dividing your garden into square feet instead of just planting your crops in a row. There's no further information about how to plant within those squares (for example, only one tomato should go per square, but you could probably put both lettuces in a square together, etc). And a row with two tomato plants, one cucumber, some basil and dill and cilantro, one pea, one bean, and a couple types of lettuce would be a strange row indeed.While i'm on the topic of being amused, i'll add that i'm desperately curious how they decided what to include in this kit. There are two tomato plants, which should provide a bounty of tomatoes, two dill plants, which is more than anyone would need unless they're a dill addict, but only one pea plant and one bean plant. That means you'll get a few pea pods a day at peak season (not even enough for a salad), and a small handful of bean pods a few times during the season (maybe fried up with garlic as a side dish for one?). Perhaps the pea pod and bean pod are for kids to grow as an experiment while their parents grow the real food plants?The theory and information aren't the only flawed aspects of this product.-The pods come packaged in a sheet of cardboard, and mine at least were very snugly fit in. I managed to shoot a couple pods across the room while trying to free them. One other, i broke the entire edge of the pod off.-The paper lids of the pod fold open to reveal a little more information about the plant, but on about half of mine, something had gone wrong and the paper was stuck together as if glued shut. Trying to open it just tore it into illegible pieces.-You take the paper lid off the pods, and if you watch the video online, you know to use your open palm to press the pod into the dirt. This works fine, except that residual glue on the rim of the pot makes it stick to your hand and pop right back out of the ground with you try to take your hand away. I found that smearing a little dirt around the rim of the pot first solves this problem, but makes the whole process take about three times as long.-The pots also don't seem to travel well. When i peeled the lid off my pea pot (and no, this isn't one i shot across the room), the peas were just rolling around on top of the planting material. Peas like to be planted about an inch deep, so what i ended up doing was just packing an inch of soil on top of that pot.-The pots need to be watered VERY gently. My hose sprayer, set at what i water every other plant with, blew the seed starting medium right out of the pots. Even the mister setting was a little too vigorous. I'm wondering if it might be better to soak the pots before planting, water the planting area thoroughly first, then stick the pot in, mulch it deeply, and leave it alone for a week or two.I've planted mine inDirt Potsof various sizes, with a sand and soil mix that has worked well for me as a potting soil in the past.So at this point, i think the only type of person to whom i'd recommend this product is a gardener with some experience but no yard. These could make a fine container garden on a sunny patio. Assuming the plants germinate and grow well, and the resulting product tastes good, this could be a one-stop-shop for someone who wishes they had the time and space for more, but simply doesn't.--Germination--(early June)I started seeing some germination within about 5 days. By 14 days, the only things that had NOT germinated were the peppers and cucumbers. Seedling counts of those that have germinated range from two (the peas and beans) up to six (romaine). I lost one of the bean plants to birds, so i highly recommend using some sort of netting or remay to protect your pea and bean sprouts until they leaf out (birds seem to mistake the little bean sprouts for tasty worms, and rip them out of the ground - this happens to my other beans too).One full month after planting, i'm comfortable assuming that anything that's going to germinate has germinated. Here's my tally for minimum seeds per pod i received. It's entirely possible there were more in some, but i can only count what broke the surface.Cilantro (x2): 3 and 4Dill (x2): 2 and 3Loose Leaf Lettuce (x2): 1 and 1Pea: 2Bean: 2Basil (x2): 3 and 2Butterhead Lettuce (x2): 2 and 5Romaine: 6Spinach: 2Cherry Tomato: 3Globe Tomato: 3Sweet Pepper: 3My cucumber never germinated. I later verified that this might have to do with one of the neighborhood cats using that container as a bed every afternoon. I dissected seed pod and found two seeds in it.Germination is not a perfect predictor of what you'll get. For example, the day after i thinned my basil plants down to one plant per container, some critter came by and finished the job on of of them. So despite having five total basil seedlings, i currently only have one small small plant.Everything except one of the pea plants are thriving, even in this strange weather (unseasonably hot mixed with overcast and humid, a very strange July in this part of the world). I didn't thin the peas, since peas usually like to be crowded. One of the pea vines is happily climbing the pole i stuck it next to. The other is an odd, stunted plant, with misshapen leaves. I'm letting it grow just to see what happens.--Flowering/Fruiting/Harvest--(mid-july)The pea plant has flowered and produced one small but tasty pod. I picked it slightly under-ripe to encourage further flowering, but as yet, nothing. The bean plant is also not flowering. There are flower buds on the tomato plants, but none on the pepper plant.The spinach plant is extremely not heat tolerant. This is the Pacific Northwest, and while it's a bit hotter than usual, it's not hot by any standard measure. Even so, the spinach plant is a withered sunburned mess. The lettuce plants a few inches away are doing just fine in the 'heat' but still too small to eat.I'm glad i didn't thin the peas, as the second pea plant progressed from short and misshapen to dead on the ground. I have no idea what befell it.One cilantro plant needs to be watered 3x/day, the other is fine with water every other day, and they're planted in identical soil in identical containers. I am no more able to explain this than the short unhappy life of the second pea plant...."
1192,778,4,"This feeder looks very pretty in my yard and was easy to fill.  However, birds haven't paid much attention to it yet even though they have emptied out the other feeders I have in my backyard.  My other feeders are brightly colored (one is yellow, the other red), so I am not sure if they are easier to see (I used the same seeds, so that isn't it), but so far the birds in my yard haven't been interested in this feeder and only fly to it and then fly away.  I'll keep an eye out and will update my review it there are any changes."
1186,583,3,"I'm always looking for ways to ""go green"" and help reduce emissions.  So when I received this Black & Decker electric lawnmower I was very excited about the possibilities and the potential to dump my old gas mower.  I soon found out that while Black & Decker has a good idea, this mower is not suited for everyone, including myself.Who would this mower be good for?  Urban dwellers who have a small yard and an outside electrical outlet.  If you live in the city and your hard is relatively flat then this may be a wonderful choice.  Still, keeping track of the cord and having to constantly be on the lookout for where the cord is laying in the yard (hint:  use an orange cord!) can get old real fast even for those with smaller yards.  I would be very concerned about the potential to run over the extension cord -- and with 110V flowing through it this is definitely not the mower I'd be having my younger teenage kids operating.If you live in the suburbs, or have a medium to large size yard, this mower is definitely not for you.  It is impossible to cut a yard of any size having to be ""chained"" to an electrical outlet.  I would not recommend using more than a 100' extension cord, and even after a 50-foot length the cord is going to become a pain to keep track of.Black & Decker has a good idea here, but corded lawnmowers just aren't practical.  If they would replace the corded feature with a battery pack then I could get excited about it.  Don't get me wrong, this mower does a great job of cutting and mulching grass -- it's just the cord really becomes a pain after a while.  They do have cordless models of their mowers available, so I recommend you check outBlack & Decker CM1836 18-Inch 36 Volt Cordless Electric Lawn Mower with Key Startfor a good alternative to this mower.  It's a bit more expensive, but trust me the freedom from the cord is well worth it.I give it three stars because it does work, and cuts grass very well, but I have to take away points for that darn cord."
528,504,4,"I have used the single kill Victor electronic trap in the past. This units kill zone looks just like that one to me only now the mice have to run up the stairs to the entry in order to accommodate the catch bin at the bottom of this unit. Once they get zapped they are dumped into the bin and the trap is ready for the next customer. That is the draw of this unit, you can get rid of multiple mice in one shot and it works.My only advice is that killing is nasty business. Make sure you don't forget about the trap, you need to empty it every day. I forgot about my single kill trap once and it wasn't pretty so I can't imagine what this one would be like with several bodies stewing in it, nope not good.My unit came with 4 C batteries. I wish they had stuck with AA batteries or D cells but they probably thought C cells were the best compromise in the design.If you have multiple mice that need taken out ASAP this is a convenient solution. It may not work for every mouse but it can be the Big Bertha in your arsenal to get most of them."
902,626,3,"This grill has a great compact design. It looks great. The construction is excellent and it seems very sturdily-built.The lid attaches to the grill base through the use of three latches. This means you can store some supplies in it, latch the lid, and carry the whole thing with the top handle. The top handle rotates to expose two adjustable ventilation holes. Unfortunately, the lack of any heat-resistant side handles is disappointing, especially if you need to move the grill once it's lit. I know the manufacturer warns against moving a hot grill, but sometimes it's just necessary.There is a charcoal tray that you place into the lower section of the grill, which has a small grate, onto which you place the charcoal. This allows air to circulate below the charcoal, and allows the ashes to settle into a tray below them. This makes it somewhat easier to clean the ashes from the grill.The cooking grate fits loosely onto the top of the grill, but can't fall into the grill. The lid fits rather well onto the grill, which proves that the design is well-thought out. However, the problems start once you put the lid on the grill.Maybe it's because the grill is so small, maybe it's because the ventilation holes are too small, or maybe it's the charcoal I'm using -- but once I put the lid on the grill to trap the heat and cook the food evenly, the charcoal is nearly smothered. The first time I used the grill, the charcoal was extinguished within 30 minutes even though the ventilation holes were completely opened. The second time I used the grill, I made sure I took the lid off at regular intervals to avoid smothering the coals. The coals were cooler when I first removed the lid, but they got hotter within two minutes. The grill basically starves the coals of air. There are small ventilation holes in the bottom of the grill, but I feel this combination of lower and upper holes just isn't enough to sustain combustion. It might be best to keep the lid off, but that results in an uneven cooking experience.It's an annoying cooking experience, to say the least.Am I completely disapoointed? No, because this is a good grill to keep handy when you either just want to throw something quick on a grill, or when you need to take a small grill to a certain location (picnic, tailgating, etc.). It will cook ""OK"", but it's not great."
995,857,4,"This kit is convenient and includes all champion branded items.The kit includes Champion brand oil SAE30, air filter, spark plug and fuel stabilizer all neatly packaged in a plastic container that doubles as a funnel and drain pan.  Just be sure the oil is the right type and viscosity for your mower.Pros:-All in one kit saves having to shop around.-Includes container that can be used as a drain pan and funnel.Cons:-Depending on your brand of mower, parts may not be exact replacements (spark plug for example).  If you buy the kit for a B&S;, you are most likely to get OEM parts or exact replacements but not so for a Honda or other brand of mower.-Container will leak if knocked over.  Top and bottom pieces do not fit very tightly.  After you fill the mower with oil, I'd transfer the used oil to a different container."
721,615,2,"The big deal about this grill is its portability. But look at the shipping weight in the product details section: 71 pounds. Subtract some for the box and foam packing material, and it's still pretty close to 70 pounds. Now, realize that it has two 30-quart coolers stowed on the bottom, and add in the weight of the ice, drinks, and meat you'll put in those coolers. Bottom line: this thing is HEAVY and will likely take 2 people to handle and maneuver.Quality control on mine was a bit lacking: one of the coolers had its lid zipper sown improperly, leaving a 3-inch opening in the front when the zipper is closed. Also, the latch that is supposed to hold down the grill's lid in transit is completely ineffectual.The plastic side shelves do not fold down, as you might expect, but are separate pieces, designed to be pushed into place when you want to use the grill and pulled out and (I presume) nested together and placed inside the grill itself for transport. Very kludgy. (The instruction manual does not say a word about how to handle the shelves while transporting the grill.)There are two ""leveling feet"" on the front legs of the grill; the back legs rest on wheels. Leveling feet are a great idea for a portable grill; however, these each provide only one-quarter of an inch of adjustment! 1/4""! Whoever designed this thing must be used to some mighty smooth picnic grounds.The transport handle does NOT lock in the up position, meaning you are limited to dragging the grill behind you; if you try to push it, the handle collapses. This grill is wider than most doorways, including the one from my sun room to the back yard, so two people are required to move it sideways through the door. The gas regulator is easy to remove and install, but there is no place to stow it for transport. If you are supposed to also stow it inside the grill, I would expect it would damage the finish of the lid and/or grate.I should also mention that all that happens to make this grill ready for transport is that you push down the sides so that the bottom of the grill rests on top of the coolers. It's not all that compact, so you must have an SUV or pickup truck to transport this grill to any remote location.We still have snow on the ground so I haven't actually cooked anything on the grill yet. This review just covers build quality, which isn't up to what I would expect at this price. When I think what I could get for just a little more money:Char Broil M2 Four-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburner--sure, that one doesn't have the promise of portability, but how often will I really want to lug this one around? And after reading another review comments about how messy this one gets, I don't know if I really want to lug this one around.Some statistics without comment: Of the 6 5-star reviews on this page, 4 were written by people who have never reviewed anything else, and the other 2 people seem to specialize in reviewing Char-Broil products. None of those reviews have a statement from Amazon that the person owns the product; the reviews that do have such a statement give it 4 stars or less."
74,919,5,"I bought these to try and save the lives of my feathered friends and so far, so good.  You see, I like to feed the birds but I don't like fattening them up for my neighbors cats.  The birds used to sit along the top of my fence while waiting their turn at the feeders, while unbeknownst to me, the cats were crouching on the other side of the fence ready to leap up and grab unsuspecting birds.  This situation was brought to my attention when my neighbor suggested I move or get rid of the feeders because she was tired of cleaning up &#34;dead bird&#34;  inside her house.Getting rid of the feeders was not an option and moving the feeders didn't solve the problem either.  So, I thought if I could keep the birds from sitting on the top of my fence and provide them with another (safer) place to wait it would be a win, win.The strips are easy to install.  Each pre-drilled section is only 2 ft. long and because they are made of plastic, there are no sharp edges.  And since they are made of clear plastic, they will never rust and they blend right into the background so they're almost invisible.  My husband thinks they will become leaf magnets in the Fall but hopefully they won't be too difficult to clean.  As far as durability is concerned, only time will tell.  I know plastic tends to get brittle over time when left in the sun but hopefully we will get several years of use out of them before they have to be replaced.  Till then, the birds can rest easy."
1388,735,5,Much better than most poles at pool supply places as this pole is heavy and not all painted in blue that just chips off anyway. It works smoothly and appears very durable.
1001,133,4,"I have two 20 watt solar panels connected to this controller, along with eight 7Ah 12V sealed batteries on the output side. I've had absolutely no problems for the last three years...the batteries charge up during the day and feed my yard lights for a few hours each evening.  It's worked reliably as annual temperatures cycled from near freezing to 105+ degrees."
740,47,5,"I have never split firewood before. This thing works great for me so it should be tremendous for an experianced person. I did order the Fiskars sharpener and sharpened it before using. First swing I missed, after that POW!! a clean split every time. Used it for over an hour without a problem."
54,488,3,"Call me old-fashioned, but give me swift, snapping death over the effect of these traps. The mouse gets stuck, then gets more and more stuck the more it struggles to get free. Certainly this works, but it is a little horrific, isn't it, to see the wild-eyed little bugger freaking out on there, squealing for help and mercy... Maybe this does a better job with very small mice that might not spring a traditional trap... But I'll be ""sticking"" (get it?) with traditional traps."
1413,779,5,"This is a very beautiful product, and it did include the lid. Made in India, it has a lovely patina finish. I don't know whether I'll use it as a hose holder or not, but it definitely has a place in my home."
1449,792,4,"It looks like a miniature water cooler. You fill the plastic bottle, screw on the cap which provides the pool for the water from which the birds drink, and hang it up. There is no assembly. This is very easy to use. It works well, but if placed in direct sunlight the water in the bottle heats up. It does a fair job of attracting birds, but not as many as a feeder."
360,364,5,"If you are tired of junk fuel cans then this is the one to buy. The fill is easy and the wide fill mark on the can is great. This is not like the other gas cans that you have to twist and pull this is very simple and works very good. Do your self a favor if you need a gas can then buy this because it's the best on the market it does not leak and it shuts off if the nozzle gets in the fluid like a gas station pump. I have thrown away many gas cans because of the poor design, but this is a keeper."
1132,371,5,"This is a thin aluminum drip pan, probably the exact same one that came with your grill. Do yourself a favor and pick up a pack and swap in a new one every now and again. That way you can pitch the one you've got that's all full of sticky, greasy, grill drippings before you have to clean it or it turns to rot."
1515,870,5,"In our mild Desert area, even in the Winter, (our real Spa Season) keeping our busy Spa clear is challenging. Orb-3 makes it so much easier because the filter catches more contaminates and it makes the standard chemicals more efficient resulting in sparkling clear water, even when the water is kept warm."
174,449,3,"This moth trap works a little bit like most pest traps, it lures the moth into the trap using the scents allure of the opposite sex. Once inside, the moths are trapped by the sticky paper (think of fly paper). Will this work? Yes. Is it gross to see a bunch of moths stuck to the inside of a sticky triangle. Yes. Personally, this is not my cup of tea. It's essentially fly paper for moths, so be prepared to remove a moth pyramid of death when it's time to replace it. It essentially works by catching the adult moths before they have a chance to produce larvae (which is what actually cause damage to material)."
1030,779,3,"A hose holder is one of those things you just don't want to pay money for. Happily, thanks to Amazon Vine, I didn't have to. ;) I had previously had one of those plastic wind-up/hand crank reel ones, and found it to be a miserable experience every time I needed to use my hose. I was eager to try something new.I like that this item has a lid. That being said, it doesn't fit properly on the bowl. Manufacturing defect, I suppose. Also, it rusts, and quite quickly I might add. Unacceptable for an item of this cost. Like many others, I saw rust within the first two weeks.There is drainage in the bottom, but this will still hold water - a little anyway. However, the drainage holes are a welcome addition.The design is nice and goes well with my landscaping. It's actually an attractive piece to have sitting amongst my hostas, bushes and plants. It blends in very nicely with the greenery. It's sturdy, too, esp with the weight of the hose holding it in place.The big issue is that this item doesn't make using your hose any easier. This is especially true if you have a long hose (75 feet long or longer) or one of those heavy duty ""no kink"" kinds. It's a real struggle to ""wind""/lay/coil your hose back into the bowl. My hose is medium duty and just doesn't respond well to be coiled into this holder; maybe that will change as the weather warms up. All that being said - this is no fault of the hose holder. It technically holds my medium-duty, no-kink 75 foot hose, but barely.For the price, this item isn't a good deal. This item should be priced around $35, tops. And, this doesn't make using your hose any easiest, just prettier, in terms of storage. ;) I think this item would make a better indoor plant holder or magazine holder instead."
1371,511,5,This is a great little planter with drainage holes that are going to be the home of some low-growing plants.  I will spray paint the container to go with my house.
898,858,4,"We were going to take the Honda Mulcher in because it was spurting a bit and we thought it needed a tune up. When this was offered by Vine I decided to hold off and let my husband take a crack at it.The packaging and this set is cleverly designed and contains everything needed. The packaging converts to a funnel and drip pan that you can toss instead of cleaning after the oil is recycled.My husband got the job in 30 minutes. Drained the oil, inserted and adjusted the spark plug, added new oil, and took it for a test run. The sputtering vanished and now all he has to do is sharpen the blade.I think this is a really clever product which probably saved me $50-$70 and an extended stay at the repair shop. I highly recommend it as an alternative to a professional tune-up. My only other advice is to recycle the old oil responsibly."
472,853,5,This is a nice little planter.  Not all the little when you get it fully expanded.  It fits herbs perfectly.  I have it on a stand and not in my window though because my cats like to get in the windows.Each section has a plastic liner so that the water doesn't leak through.
1187,78,4,"Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that."
1440,525,5,"We'll it's official... it really works.Our neighborhood is infested with feral cats, but we don't have a rodent problem.I really don't mind the cats themselves, it's the crapping in my garden and my children's sandbox that has me up in arms about them. Plus, all they do is breed, multiple and fight.I chose this trap to help resolve our little problem. I didn't want to use inhumane tactics, like a pellet or paintball gun, or poison, so the live trap was the best and only alternative.My children got all excited that we actually caught our first cat yesterday. All we did was put a $0.40 can of cat food in the trap that night and in the morning we had a trapped cat. Beautiful!We will be setting another can out tonight. It's quite exciting for the family to have this much anticipation over catching a cat. I like it more for the simple fact that I will be reclaiming the yard."
1508,876,5,"I did receive this brush for free but I have not been compensated for this review.I gave this brush 5 stars because finally I have a brush that will clean all the edges and corners of the grill without burning myself, (I like to clean it when it is hot), and this brush has an 18&#34; handle. It does a very nice job with little effort. It is quite wide on the brush end so it is also faster to use to get to the end result. The only thing is I think the bristles could be a little longer, but it still is a great brush that will last for quite some time and I'm very happy with that!"
352,910,4,"This fire pit was no trouble to put together, all you had to do was screw the legs on and attach the handle to the cover guard. It is heavy duty and seems as if it will be very durable. Of course extreme heat can always warp any metal no matter how durable it is but I feel as though this pit will last a long time. It is recommended to keep a layer of sand along the base of the pit to help evenly distribute the heat and to stop areas from burning out too quickly.This kit also comes with a guard removal tool, a long hook that allows you to hook the handle and remove the guard without risk of burning. Also included is a vinyl cover which I thought was a great addition. However the cover seems to a bit too small for the pit and it is quite a tight squeeze--try too hard and it will rip. Odd that they didn't try to make it a better fit.Overall I am pleased with this fire pit, it has made an attractive addition to my deck. So far we have used it as a charcoal brazier but I look forward to burning wood in it during the fall and early winter months. I feel that it is definitely large enough to keep you warm when it's chilly outside."
1422,842,5,"I've used both this brand and the Shultz brand of rooting hormone for many years.  I've had good success with both brands, and a few failures (mainly due to not keeping the medium at the right level of moisture).  I was pleased to receive this jar from the Vine program, just in time for starting my garden indoors (we move all the plants outdoors once risk of frost is passed).I tried rooting a cutting from my favorite Jerusalem cherry plant, and in just a few days it had put out rootlets and was thriving.  I used this hormone in a small vase of water and was able to get a rose cutting to sprout within a week.  I have a cutting from a jade plant started right now, and it's also showing tiny roots.  This is a great product and will give your cuttings a great start!"
1120,101,5,"The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to the other. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.This tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.I like this cordless trimmer so much that my Echo gas trimmer has been gathering dust in the garden shed the past two years."
1657,266,5,"Put off getting these for a very long time simply because they seemed kind of silly when I have always used a rake upside down to basically scoop up the leaves/clippings. While that still work fairly well, I do find that these are easier to work with, especially if I am needed to scoop up piles in tighter areas - less are dropped etc. For the price, its a great addition to the tool shed and has helped with the annual leaf cleanup."
432,119,5,For some reason this was going for a very low price - I bought it because of that and only afterwards learned how nice a lightweight trowel it so have!
1536,592,2,"I applied this several times in increasing amounts to see just how much it would take to make an impact.  In most cases the answer was ""a lot"".  In small amounts I'd see ants merrily walking through it ignoring it.  Of a dozen problems locations I tried, two seem to have had an impact on the colony, and that was when I encircled them completely using lots with no escape.  One of the biggest failures was my mailbox which gets swarmed when it rains.  I surrounded the post, put some on post ledges, and some in the back of the mailbox where they were entering; they just ant-laughed at me.  I didn't use at the indoor areas where ants were entering because of pets/children.Shockingly perhaps, I have the better ant control results with the plastic bait traps combined with spraying active areas."
848,874,5,"My children are 5 and 2, and spring's ""from seed"" project didn't go so well.  We planted a good variety of things - herbs and veggies - and very few of them made it.  This is mostly due to some uncharacteristically hot weather when we went away for a weekend in June.When I saw this, I thought it was perfect to try again.  We had gotten through some very hot July weather in Boston (lots of high 80s and super muggy days) and felt that it would be ok to give these a go in August so that the kids might achieve some yield before the colder fall weather.They arrived tucked into a cardboard holder, and we went out and loosened some soil in a couple of areas that had the perfect amount of sunlight (there are unfolding directions printed on the pull-off tops for each).  It tells you how far apart to plant them as well.The kids took turns pushing the pods into the loosened soil, then we did a full watering.  Truth be told, they did a little too much watering in one section.  They've continued to water them every day, though we have missed a few days here and there.  So far, we have sprouts in 15 of the 18 pods.  The kids are so excited!  Every day when we get home they run to the back yard to see how much bigger they are.  Once they are all big enough to really distinguish, I'll update this review with what did well and what did not.Very happy with this set as it has helped me to explain what plants need to grow, and the importance of nutrients and water.  The kids can't wait until they can eat the food they've grown."

It's like a treadmill on steroids.  You get the great workout of a treadmill walk with the added benefit of some resistance work as you push the mower through the grass.  I'm serious.  It's a great way to get a little exercise AND groom your yard at the same time.We have a backyard that is mostly St. Augustine (a tough Southern grass) with a small area of Bermuda.  This mower cuts through both with ease.  I even cut the St. Augustine one morning when it was quite damp from the sprinkler running, and, to my amazement, this mower powered through it (wet grass!).  Even though the grass was higher than we usually let it get.  I was impressed!The mower uses some kind of flywheel effect to increase your forward momentum (making the mower much, much easier to push than a standard reel-type).  The blades are sharp and it leaves a much nicer finish on the yard than any gas-powered mower we've ever used. It's also exceptionally quiet (even compared to other manual reel mowers).I like it so much that yesterday, we gave our nearly-new 18"" gas powered push mower to a neighbor in need.  This mower is THAT good.You can easily adjust the height of your cut and the height of the push-bar to accommodate another human propeller (my husband is 6'3"" and I'd say he's about one inch from the upper limit of tall for this mower).Like any mower, to get a good finish you need to overlap your tracks.  And if your grass is super-long when you cut it, you'll want to either rake up the cuttings or make a couple of passes to mulch the cuttings.We have shrubbery lining one side of our house that's within a narrowing range of 2 to 4 feet of our fenceline.  This mower was surprisingly easy to use in that thin strip of grass (kind of like a bowling alley lane).  I found it very easy to maneuver the mower in this tiny space.  It's easy to back up (which it does without engaging the blades) & I found it easy to turn and reposition as needed, even in this closely confined area.If you're looking for a gas-free solution to your grass cutting needs, this is a terrific choice.  Highly recommended for its pushing ease & sharp blades that look like they'll hold their edge for years.P.S.  I've had really good luck with Fiskars products; their stand-up weeder is one of my favorites (Fiskars 7870 Uproot Lawn and Garden Weeder), helping me to save our yard from a crabgrass infestation.  Here's a link to that review, FYI: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0DXF6G4H2B4/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"
987,331,5,"I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from ""set"" to ""caught."" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice."
1315,938,5,"Love this hummingbird feeder, and so do the hummers!  Within minutes of filling the feeder and hanging it I had a hummingbird, and she's been coming back ever since.It's a nice design, looks a lot classier than the ugly plastic red ones you can buy for cheap.  Easy to open, fill and reassemble.  Looks great hanging outside.I just wonder why the free nectar was not enough to fill the feeder, it fills it about half full, which is better than nothing!My birds are happy with this product and so am I."
567,839,5,"I was skeptical about this when it arrived, but have used it a couple of times, and I love it. It really works well when flipping an omelet. I won't say it's essential, but it really does make things easier as it conforms to the contours of whatever size pan you're using. If you make omelette a lot, like we do, this is sooo worth having! And great whether you're right or left handed."
1291,139,5,"I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house, and I love them.  They are practically indestructable, and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses, bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well, which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it."
1032,929,5,"I have several oven mitts but I really like these. They stretch and fit all of us, from my hands to my sons larger hands, no problem. The fingers make it easy to grip onto handles, the sides of casseroles, the edges of cooking sheets. Sometimes the bulk of oven mitts make it hard to handle these items, not a problem with these gloves. I heated my oven to 500 to put a cast iron skillet in, the skillet didn't even feel warm to me with these gloves as protection. They are usable on both sides so no worries about which hand to put them on.The lines are non skid, and they work! The gloves clamp on the surface of whatever I'm lifting and it feels very secure.They are made with meta-aramid and para-aramid fibers by dupont. I had no idea what that meant, to be honest, so I looked it up. According to my google-fu it's a type of kevlar that is both cut, stab, and heat resistant.If there was one small nitpick it would be that I would like them to be a little longer up the wrist. For me they are fine but as larger hands stretch them out more they are shorter at the wrist and it would just be nice to have them a touch longer, but not even worth a star as in every other way they are great.Thick without being bulky, fingers to grasp, super heat resistant, these gloves are winners in every way.Sample provided"
593,180,5,"I got an s-hook to put on the branch, and this slides right on the end of that for perfect height, so I can watch them from the living room.  The suet cakes slide in easily, and the top slides up the rope for easy filling.  I added red pepper flakes to keep squirrels away, and so far that has done the trick :)  I'm pleased."
949,859,4,"This is a handy kit offered at a reasonable price.  It includes everything you'll need to maintain your mower:  oil, air filter, spark plug and gasoline stabilizer.  And the packaging itself is designed to be your funnel and oil pan.  The positives: compact design, very reasonable price and you get everything you need in one convenient package.  The negatives: no instructions or tool to change the spark plug, no easy way to measure out less that the full amount of stabilizer (assuming you don't fill your gas tank) and I'd recommend using a sturdier funnel and oil pan. The plastic container was cracked on delivery so the Champion funnel was unusable.  Finally, the caveat:  make sure these components fit to your B&S engine.  One easy thing to do is to compare the photo of the air filter with the one on your engine.  They are not all the same so beware before purchasing.  But all-in-all a nice design and a convenient way to ensure you keep your mower in top operating condition."
1208,550,3,"This Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap has a cute design but it did very little to control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Terro product did not perform as well as the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH"
664,78,5,"I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12"" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is ""above"" the cat.  That won't work with my cats - they'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren't going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2"" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2"" pvc, too little for 3/4"" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought ""Now why can't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn't inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones."
987,851,4,"The Perky-Pet Glass Mason Jar Hummingbird Feeder is well-designed and I like that the jar is real glass vs. plastic. It reminds me of the canning jars my grandmother had many years ago.I've used a couple different brands of  nectar and the hummingbirds do come and use the feeder. It's very calming to watch them even though their wings beat at a furious rate.Filling it is easy: Just unscrew the jar and fill it up, then screw it back in. The only issue I have personally when setting it back on the post is that some of the nectar spills out because I have to flip it around to hang it. But that's no big deal.To clean it, I just hose it off. It's very sturdy and I look forward to using this for many years ahead. And it looks nice too in our flower garden. Two thumbs up."
726,487,5,I love this nozzle. it is great! there are multiple functions it can be used. Very handy to use when it comes to cleaning a car or spray water to ur garden!
182,696,4,"My husband ordered this because of our stink bug problem. His previous solution was to leave our central vac out all the time but in my clumsiness, I kept tripping over the hose as it lay in the middle of the floor.When this arrived and I tried it for the first time, I thought, ""How silly not to have a built in vacuum."" It seemed a little awkward to prime it, position it, and press the trigger. But after a try or two it seems like such a great idea.There is a large black plunger at the bottom. When you compress this it locks into place with a click. Then you position your BugZooka within a "" of your insect offender and press the red trigger button. Instantly your home invader is in a small but escape proof chamber.My six-year-old has had a blast (literally) using this for the past few days and easily getting the stinkbugs jailed for good.Once they are in though, it is up to you to determine how to dispose of them. They do not die once sucked in so you need to take a cap off the jail chamber and do with them what you want.Now I'm the biggest wus of them all. I don't like to squish bugs and I especially don't like to kill spiders - they do too much to keep the bugs in check around our forested home. So I liked the idea of being able to release certain creatures back into the wild in an attempt to keep good karma and harmony in our wooded environment.I have one exception to that rule -- stink bugs. A few years ago it was ladybugs that swarmed our home. I would vacuum at least 100 a day from our skylights and other windows and those buggers bite! Now it is stinkbugs but they are foul if you squish them (not that I could anyway). So they get to swim in the giant pool that eventually releases to a fun water slide that leads to our septic tank.So the bottom line is this: this takes a little more than a button push to get the bug. It does not kill them. But it requires no batteries and is easy enough for a 6 year-old to use. Nuff said."
151,706,5,"One you understand aligning this thing over the weed it's a no-brainer. That takes about 3 weeds to be consistent. Interesting device, very clever.  Easy to use.  Nice thing is the weed is gone; with chemicals it may be dead in three days, but it's still around for a week and more."
367,279,5,"Another quality Dramm product. Heavy, heavy brass unit with solid shut off mechanism. This is something that, without too much daily abuse, should last a lifetime."
13,308,5,"Yes, I use my Mantis tiller every day to loosen up my horse stalls.  Not typical use for a device like this, but it works fantastic.My horse stalls have a sand base, and running the tiller over them every day keeps the sand loose and the stalls fresh. I've been using this tiller in my stalls for several months now, and it's running like a champ. It gets the job done done quickly and better than I could do with a rake."
1542,722,3,"I used Garden Genius Lightweight Pot Fillers for the first time today in the 11.5 and 6.25 inch sizes.  It was the easiest potting I've ever done.  Usually my potting projects start with a lengthy search for the perfect rock or pot shard to cover the hole at the bottom of the pot.  But this time I slapped in the pot filler, added soil, the plant and water.  Not a speck of soil escaped the pots and the water drains freely.  I was finished in a fraction of the time and had no mess to clean up other than washing my hands.  I am a believer in how well it works.However, it is far too expensive for all my potting needs.  My plants remain in pots for years at a time, so it is doubtful I will ever re-use the pot filler.  The pot filler fabric resembles a scratchy pot scrubber and is easily cut to size, so I am taking the advice of another reviewer and ordering the Garden Genius GG-ROLL-1 Durable Pot Filler Roll, 12-Inch x 52-Inch which is a fraction of the price and should be just as effective. I cannot see paying more than a couple dollars each for this product. I give the pre-cut pot fillers 5 stars for usefulness, but less than 1 star for cost effectiveness."
467,477,5,I can attest that the birds in Southern California love Morningstar year round blend.  I filled myBirdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder(about 1 1/2 pounds of seed).  The birds sat on it all day every day and the feeder was empty in two days.
173,694,4,"After I got this I realized I needed to use it in a smaller pot. It cut easily with scissors. However, in a small pot the one-inch thickness was a little more than I desired. I can see that it would be right in a larger pot.It does keep the dirt from draining out of the bottom of the pot, and it is lightweight so it has advantages over placing rocks in the pot. My plant is still healthy after several months of use.  I would prefer that the disc be made of recycled material and that the price would be less."
776,81,5,"Waiting for the yard waste to break down normally takes a while on average, but three days ago I spread a layer of Ringer 3050 compost plus  on my compost pile, watered well and forgot about it, thinking it would take time to start the magic of Ringer 3050 Compost.. this morning as I passed the containing, knowing that in Arizona's heat it might need watering. One day after applying...What a surprise I found... you could see that the pellets had already broken down and a richlooking yard waste was well on its way to rich compost, I turned it over, deeper this time and again placed a layer of pellets, closed the top,This watering and turning and placing the pellets has been around 12 days now and 3/4 of the container has a very black compost, really black.  What is really great there is no odor,Amazing stuff, The packaging comes in a 2 pound box, it took very little of the pellets to start and to keep activation.  Very, very pleased with this product.Now, the only thing to await is to see how well the fruits and flowers react to this rich mixture.Here in the desert a heavy loam clay is about all there is, so a rich compost that has a rich black color is a delight,Happy with this product and will be sure to keep a box available.  Recommend this for 5 stars."
240,926,5,"The chairs arrived extremely well-packaged - TRIPLE boxed! Lots of cardboard, ties and plastic sheets to protect during shipping.UPS will deliver the box on a 2-wheeler and as it is heavy (approx 57#), you will probably want to unpack it where it is unloaded.  We had ours pushed inside the front door and we should have pushed it out onto the back patio to unpack it because we almost didn't have enough room in the living room when we discovered how many layers we had to go through to get to the chairs!  As a result of the packing, they arrived in perfect condition!  AND, NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED!!!We LOVE these chairs!!!  They are very nice to look at!  They are very sturdy and well made!  And, most importantly, they are comfortable! The back is high enough, I sometimes put a small pillow behind my head and just enjoy sitting.I am a senior gal who has a bit of a problem getting off and on some types of furniture.  Not these chairs!  They are secure to sit on and the arms provide what I need to get myself up and out of them. I might add, if you are a plus size person as I am, it means a lot to have the security of a well made chair.There isn't any information included with the chairs other than a card saying that if there is an error in the shipping they can be returned to Amazon free of charge within 30 days of delivery.Very pleased!"
1238,878,4,I have several mice that try to make a living in the backroom of my garage every single year around this time and I get them every single year-I dont know if they talk or what but it has always been a problem. I never get them in the house thatnk God for that. So I set this out for a few nights to no avail and one the third night was a bingo-caught two of them ready to make their winter break home back there. Easy cleanup and done til next year! I hope! Lol This is much nicer than the old traps-no cheese and I dont slap my hand in the wires which I always seemed to do!
688,701,4,"The product is easy to use. You pull out a plastic fork that pops right out. Then you push down and turn on the round container. That pops a hole underneath of the cup and the liquid fills the container. Don't do this step while you are holding the device because if you do not hold it straight, the liquid will spill out.Seems to be working for the big black ants which is what I see moving around this week. (Beginning of July, NE USA)"
586,36,2,"This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as ""starting fluid"" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
356,554,2,Too small and flimsy; is there a larger and more sturdier tray out there???
1310,941,2,"All of these expanding hoses have the same problem: They burst. Most of them work great for a brief time-- you feel happy because they are indeed lighter and easier to handle than typical hoses that are unwieldy, heavy, and a pain to store. This is the kind of thing you can just unscrew and toss into the shed... well, kind of. If your shed doesn't get too hot.The thing is, it seems that it's going to burst eventually even if you treat it right, but you're supposed to really handle it with kid gloves: Don't leave it out in the sun or cold. You have to shake it dry in between uses and store it indoors. It's not safe for drinking water.If you're absolutely determined to try this type of hose, then Rumford seems to be the best of them at the moment (maybe due to the better brass fitting), but that's not saying much. A product this likely to burst under normal use shouldn't be on the market yet."
289,847,5,"Received these claw's on Friday and used them on a pork shoulder roast. They worked great, shredded the roast very easily. Made great pulled pork sandwiches. They also worked great in removing the roast from the pan. Very sturdy and well made."
1077,307,5,"I'm happy to report that this trap is working well.I also have a two-door model that will not work correctly, its a havahart 1062.This trap also uses a cable to hold the door open.  I'm not really enthusiastic about the cable design.But this trap works well and has been reliable enough.  If the reliability changes over time I will update my review.  I am worried that the cable design won't be as durable as my older Havahart."
197,387,5,This product is made to last a long time - - very good quality materials.
1135,281,5,Quality product and easy to install.  The most important thing is it works. Try this with pork ribs to test it and it come out delicious and juicy.  Temperature is a lot more easy to control.  No more fussing with aluminum foil to line the grill every time and wasted fuel. The 60 briquets last a long time. Fire bricks are cheap but too heavy for the one-touch grill without the steel frame. The smokenator looks a lot neater and professional. Really glad someone create this and it is so very convenient.
719,878,1,I tried using this for three weeks and never caught a single anything. I re-set it and baited it every night and the bait was gone every morning and the red light was on but nothing in the trap. Still have rats in the ceiling going back to poison I guess. Wish this worked but it was useless.
441,672,4,"Have had it for 2 seasons. The only complaint, which most yell about is the battery longevity. Taking the fact it takes 8 hours or so to recharge and they last about 15 minutes takes away one star to a 4.But I do like the fact the battery works on many other B&D; products, which is a plus."
39,467,5,"I use them for when I am camping.  I use half of one cube for my Weber Go-Anywhere under a chimney starter.  Camping in December in the mountains, the fire started immediately and the charcoal was flaming in just a few minutes.I also put them in an emergency kit.  I used a striker emergency lighter on a test run and it lit up fine after a few tries.  The trick I found is to shave some little pieces off to aid in ignition."
1284,253,5,"This bench looks amazing.  We've had it in our garden area and had to move it to our deck so it would be more pronounced visually - it's that rare piece of yard furniture/equipment that you actually want people to see!It's also quite comfortable - we're using it without any pads, and have had no complaints sitting on it for an hour stretch.Not much (anything) bad to say about this - it was very easy to put together (4 pieces that you screw together), and just as easy to take apart if you need to for winter storage.  Was shipped/padded nicely, no missing pieces...Would highly recommend, especially over those cheap wooden/iron slatted benches that you always find in home improvement stores for maybe half price that look bad and wobble/sway when you sit in them, and last about 1 season.  This one is built better, looks nicer, and is going to last much longer."
1368,584,5,"This is a very good sprayer as compared to others that I have purchased in the past. Very easy to put together and use. The stand at the bottom for the wand is very convenient and the lock-in for handle is also  a nice feature. It provided a good spray pattern for the sealant that I applied. It was more expensive than some others, but well worth the price. The shoulder strap was also very good. Unit made the job easier for me."
629,871,5,"If you have  a bunch of little ""ankle-biters"" in your pool you probably have a sunscreen scum.  They just seem to go together. This product appears to solve the ring-around-the -tub problem.No detectable odor. Use 1oz per 2,000 gals of water. Swish it around in a bucket of water and mix it with the pool water."
691,751,5,"My Humane Society has the Havahart traps which they lend out to home owners, so I am familiar with this brand. I have had to borrow a trap several times over the years. Now I have my very own Havahart trap. I have used it to catch several feral cats in our neighborhood. I really like the easy handle to set and release the trap, so you do not have to get close to the animal. It works beautifully and does not hurt the animal. I like that. Our humane society offers free spay and neutering to feral animals, so as I catch them, I take them to the humane society and then release them after the operation. This is the trap I needed to do so."
1083,950,5,"Received this product at no charge. Absolutely love it, big and sturdy. It even has a bottle opener on it."
974,756,5,"I really like this product.  I was very skeptical at first, considering my only real experience cutting a lawn with a manual mover was using the old Craftsman we have on hand, which gets sharpened every year, but still just doesn't do the job well.Well, this product exceeded my expectations.  It mows my lawn beautifully - and quickly.  It flies over all types of grass, short and tall in short order, and does a terrific job mulching the grass as well.  I also don't get a ton of debris on my legs, which is awesome (though it really does cut the grass up pretty well, so my shoes are usually covered from walking over the clippings).Big fan of this mower.  It's smooth, and does an outstanding job cutting.I've also taken it over some fairly tall grass that I normally would have used a string trimmer over, but this mover just blazed right through.  Awesome.The height adjustments are super easy:  bend over, pull out a nob, lift up, release;  do the other side.  It takes maybe 5-10 seconds to raise/lower to the height you want.The ONE thing I can think of which is moderately negative about it is that it's a little heavy, which makes starting to move it on an uphill a little tough at times - but this is easily counterbalanced by how well it cuts through the grass once it is in motion.All in all, I am VERY impressed by this product.  Definitely 5 stars in my opinion, and has convinced me to buy Fiskars products in the future."
1295,592,4,We put the ant bait around the house and on some ant beds that we had in the yard. I did notice a difference and didn't see nearly as much ant activity. I'm happy with the product!
1422,860,5,"I'll admit that we don't always keep up with the maintenance on our lawn mower.  It's dirty and heavy, and it sits in the barn between uses - out of sight, out of mind.I got this Champion Tune Up Kit, and decided that I was going to try to do it myself. I'm happy to say that it was fast, easy, and not messy at all.  It took me about a minute to get the old spark plug loosened up without breaking it (we have a spark plug socket), but the new plug was a perfect match and screwed right in.  The new air filter was also just like the dirty one (extremely dirty!) and installed easily.Changing the oil was slightly harder but I managed to do it without spilling, breaking or losing anything.  I ran the engine for a minute or two, to warm up the oil, then wiped around the oil plug (where an inch of grass and dirt had built up) before opening the plug.  I tipped the mower to drain the old oil out (into the included cup) and then replaced the plug.  Next I used the included funnel to pour in the new oil and I was done!  I saved the gas treatment for this fall, when we put the mower away for the season.  I have the cup and funnel full of old oil ready to take to our local transfer station, for safe recycling.Now there's no excuse for not doing the basic maintenance that will keep your Briggs and Stratton engine running at its best.  If I can do it, so can you!"
964,869,5,"What it does:The Havahart Spray Away Elite II is designed to scare off critters that come to eat your garden vegetables. It does this by spraying a jet of water to startle the creature. When a creature ventures into the field of view of Spray Aways sensor, it activates and fires a jet of water. The intensity is similar to a garden hose with a nozzle being turned on at about 75% of full blast for about 5 seconds. The water jet sweeps a few degrees and makes a startling noise. Spray Away does not directly target and shoot water at animals (unless it gets lucky). It detects heat and motion at a distance of 30 feet from the front of the unit. It covers a 180 degree angle. It can't detect animals coming from directly behind it. The solar powered battery can fire about 5 times a day. There's no need to hook up a hose like some other similar models. It has 2 led lights which flash when water is low or the charge is low. The LED lights are not bright, but are visible even in bright daylight. Maintenance is rather minimal, only requiring twice a week water fill up (but this depends on how many animals cross its path) and wiping the solar panel and detector surfaces clean. Fit and finish quality are high.Set-up:I found the set up very easy. You fill the tank with 3.5 gallons of water. Choose the sensitivity from a dial and turn the unit on. The sensitivity setting is not well defined in the instructions, but I assume it's based on the size of the animal you are attempting to deter (contact with the company confirms that the settings are based on animal size, 9 being most sensitive for small animals). Strangely, instructions do not tell you exactly what a 'large' or 'small' animal is in terms of measurements. The higher the sensitivity setting the smaller the animal the unit will detect. A very high sensitivity may produce false activations. For example, a tree limb moving in the field of view or a butterfly might cause the unit to spray. Therefore, you may need to lower the sensitivity a bit or move the unit to a different location. I have mine set on 8 out of 9 to deter pesky rabbits. I have not experienced any false alarms.  You can adjust the spray jet to travel about a maximum of 25 feet. The spray head also rotates during squirting so that the jet of water is always firing somewhere different. This keeps the unit from becoming predictable to animals and losing its effectiveness.Conclusion:My only major complaints are the instructions and the indicator lights. The manual says to set the sensitivity values based on ""small"", ""medium"" and ""large"". Large what? I assume animals? How big? Not sure. The indicator lights are positioned on the front of the unit. If you forget to turn off the unit and try to read the LED lights, you will get hit with a jet of cold water. Also, the top of the sprayer is a place where birds like to roost and, of course, poop. The poop lands on the solar panels. Hopefully, on the next re-design of this product, the Havahart engineers will make that roosting spot a little pointy so that birds will avoid sitting there.So far Spray-Away has been very effective. Rabbits devouring spinach and lettuce were our problem last season. I have not seen one rabbit (or any other varmint) in our 25' x 30' garden area since placing the unit on the perimeter. They actually seem to be avoiding the garden. We left some ""bait lettuce"" in the garden for a few days as a test and so far it is completely uneaten. I have had no problems with inadequate charging of the battery. It always seems ready to work.I think the Spray-Away is worth the extra expense. It's actually fun to use and is a much better alternative to applying chemical deterrents (especially in an edible garden). If you have a huge garden, you will probably need additional Spray Aways and of course, this could be costly. Also, if you expect many animals to be crossing through your garden, you may want to get the version with attached hose, as you don't want to have to fill up the unit with water constantly, but remember that animals will eventually learn to avoid the Spray Away's path and therefore, it should spray less and less.I highly recommend this product if you have a garden munching animal problem and a little extra money to spend."
168,937,5,"I've had my hose haphazardly on the ground for 2 summers now, so this was just what I needed! When it arrived I was surprised by how heavy it was. Super heavy duty, well made with solid construction. Easy to attach to the house and attractive, especially since my house has green trim. I use my hose all over the yard, about 180 degrees around and it was always hard for me to yank it over to where I need it. I love that this reel swivels around but locks if I want. Now, it's really easy and enjoyable to water my plants. Also, the little shelf on top really came in handy so I don't lose little odds and ends when I'm working in outside. Really happy with this hose reel!!"
903,844,3,"I wanted this to be my mosquito miracle but it wasn't. It is easy to operate. You have to put in the included batteries, pop in the repellant, and turn the fan on. It seemed to be working in that we weren't swarmed but we all still got bit. Maybe if we add a few more around the back but just 1 was not effective."
674,906,5,"This is the best hose I've ever used/owned.Some details:-5/8&#34; x 50'-About 7 pounds-Reinforced vinyl covering-Lay-flat technology-500 psi-Bacteria & Mold inhibitorsI love this hose. And, to my surprise, the lay-flat technology works... it lays flat! And I didn't notice any kinking. Love that it is lighter than my previous hose as I will primarily be using it for gardening/car washing. I had no issues and it wasn't difficult at all to roll it back onto the rack. Never thought I would be this excited about a hose... but I am! Highly recommend!"
712,755,5,"This StaySharp mower is the budget option of the beautifully-designed Fiskars reel mowers, which aim to revamp and revitalize the old-skool push mowers our grandpas used.There are three options in this line, the StaySharp (cheapest), Staysharp Plus (mid-range), and the Staysharp Max (which has more premium features to handle tough situations). While the manufacturer's prices reflect these differences, retailers such as Amazon set their own prices, so it may behoove you to check the current pricing on all three to be sure you are making the right choice for your budget and needs.In this review I will discuss my experiences with the StaySharp Max first since I have owned it for some time, then share what differentiates the three mowers so you can make the best buying decision for your lawn.I've owned the StaySharp Max (which was previously called the Momentum but has been re-named to fit within this StaySharp line) for over a year now and it allowed me to get rid of my old gas mower, which I absolutely hated. The pull-cord, the noise, the smell, and the mess of dealing with gasoline made mowing an unpleasant task.Traditional reel mowers are hard to push, a bit on the noisy side, and get rusty and funky fast so need a lot of maintenance to stay in good shape. The Fiskars StaySharp Max, by contrast, is quiet enough that I can have a conversation while mowing. I have not had to sharpen it in the year I have used it.While it gets my heart pumping, it's more of an aerobic exercise than one that takes muscles or may cause injury. In fact, it's so fun to use that my other half was willing to take on the task of lawn care and mowing! He has neck and back issues but found this an easy and fun way of staying fit and helping around the house.The benefits of a reel mower are numerous - the blades get a cleaner cut than rotary (most gas) mowers, so no brown tips on your grass, they cut the clippings into much smaller pieces so you can leave the clippings without them chunking up on the lawn and looking messy (I can hardly see the clippings and they compost in very quickly), and you just get a finer look since there are more blades cutting.Now, the differences:StaySharp:The StaySharp is the budget option, and is also the most like a traditional reel mower. It has a rear grass discharge which does sprinkle grass clippings on your shoes. There is a grass catcher available to purchase.The shield covering the blades in front is good for people who might need to mow close to shrubs and don't want to catch the limbs on the front of the blades. It also prevents clippings from being thrown onto the sidewalk, flowerbeds, or buildings if you approach from the front.Since the grass catcher is behind the mower in this case, it does not obstruct your mowing view while using it.The downside is that this mower has less power in the gear system so may need a little more elbow grease on your part than with the other two, it does not have inset wheels for closer edging, and it does not cut as high as four inches like the other models do (it goes from 1.5 to 3.5 inches). Organic gardeners will know that 4 inches is truly an ideal length for preventing weeds and preserving water in the lawn, but 3.5 inches is still better than most mowers.The verdict: Use this if you have a flat lawn with few weeds (so you don't need power), if you want to use a grass catcher with every mow, or if you are on a budget.StaySharp Plus:The Plus has a forward discharge to keep clippings away from users' feet. It does not work with a grass catcher, which is fine for most organic gardeners because it is far better to leave the clippings, and these mowers cut the clippings into tiny pieces.The Plus has slightly larger wheels and slightly more power than the regular version, so can handle slightly more weeds or a mild slope. It cuts from 1.5"" to 4"".Verdict: This is the budget option for those who don't want a grass catching bag. It has slightly better features than the regular version but does eliminate the grass catching option.StaySharp Max (formerly the Momentum):The Max has an inset wheel design which gives it a closer cut along the edges of your lawn, and eliminates any areas of lawn that get flattened and then don't get cut. By the time your wheels run over the grass, you have trimmed it. This gives you a better result in the end and makes mowing cleaner and easier to control.It also has a LOT more power. While I liked using the StaySharp and found it a huge improvement over normal reel mowers, the StaySharp Max felt like a dream to run. It's downright airy! You get it going with a little push and the cutting reels turn and turn with little input after that. It does the work for you! It really feels like there is a lot of technological innovation here, between the chain drive mechanism which makes it easy to push and the way those blades keep cutting after only a quick push.The Max has a front-discharge, so does not spray grass on your shoes. However, used with the grass-catcher bag, it can obstruct your view of where you are mowing since the bag sits in the front.The Max is ten pounds heavier than the other two, which sounds bad but actually makes it easier to get momentum and power through tougher weeds. It cuts from 1-4"", so it has the biggest range of cut heights. I used it on a slope and found it pretty easy to deal with. My home lawn is bumpy and somewhat weedy and this has no problem, except for very wiry weeds which I just cut with my hedgers or string-trimmer.The verdict: If you can afford it, this is the mower to get. It has WAY more power to it which makes it impressively easy to push, it has more options (grass catcher, cutting heights), and the features are ones that make mowing more fun. However, if you do plan to use the grass-catcher with every mow and you have a flat lawn with no weeds, the regular StaySharp may be better because the grass-catcher sits in back and doesn't obstruct your view as you mow. Otherwise, the Max is the best mower for eco-friendly lawns, with its ease of use and eco features.The one downside to every one of these mowers (and the old reel mowers too) is that they do not cut down tall grasses, particularly wiry ones. So you have to keep up with your lawn care and not let it get out of control. A gas mower can chew through some overgrowth, but these just knock it down if it gets really tall and won't do anything to it at all. So if you don't have super-regular habits, I'd pair any of these mowers with a string trimmer/ weed whacker which can double as an edger and be your backup in case you go away and forget to have your house-sitter mow.I hope this helps you decide which is best for you. While the mower on this page, the StaySharp, has some fantastic features for specific situations (perfect, flat lawns where a grass catcher is needed) and is a huge improvement over Grandpa's push mower, in the average, imperfect lawn, I'd choose the Max."
778,251,5,"I found out about diatomaceous earth from a friend years ago who uses the medical grade to worm her animals and family with.  She lives on a farm so mites and all were a problem as well, so she'd use it on her animals.My son had an allergic reaction to commercial bug spray when he was little - a very severe reaction that has made me very, very leary to use the chemicals in my older home again.  We live in Georgia, in an old home close to the woods, so bugs are QUITE common.  I use boric acid powder and diatomaceous earth and it works well for all my problems.When you get this, expect it to be very light - it won't mean the bottle is empty, it's just a very lightweight substance.  Also, don't expect to squirt it on an ant hill or a big ugly cockroach and watch it die.  They won't.  What happens is the bugs get the powder on them and they run back to their mounds or nests and hopefully they get it on their friends.  It gets in the crevices between their 'shell' plates and also in their guts and it rips holes and kills them.  It IS very effective.  Even in Georgia, with open doors and windows, I have NEVER had an infestation.You can put it in animal bedding and it won't hurt your dogs and cats.  It's not chemical, as another reviewer said, it is mechanical in nature.  I really don't know why more people don't use it.  The Safer brand is trustworthy, and the tipped bottle makes it very easy to apply in the thin lines I use the most in applying this.When I've seen a bug in my house, I put a line around my doors and whereever I saw it crawling.  Then usually a few days later I find 2-3 dead bugs just belly up.  Season change is very important - I've learned to go ahead and put my protective lines down when the seasons are changing and that's really helped keep my house bug free.  IE every equinox or solstice.  But again, I'm in a climate and area with a LOT of bugs.  It maybe different if you're up North.A bottle this size lasts me - for household use - about 4 months."
695,904,4,"The fertilizer is earth-toned and really looks like regular soil/sand mix. I like to put my fertilizer in one clump next to the plants and remove the clump at the end of the growing season. With this fertilizer, it's difficult to distinguish it from the regular soil to remove it. Have to mark it with other means to remember where the fertilizer was applied."
380,917,3,"I have somewhat mixed thoughts about this. It's kind of fun to play with, but I was hoping it would remind me to water the plants on my balcony, and fertilize them. Like, I would like to be riding the train home from the city and I suddenly get a text or notification like &#34;hey, you need to water the plants!&#34; I need this because I tend to forget and they tend to die. It doesn't work that way, though. Instead I have to open up the app, on my iPad (because that's where I installed it, although the app is designed for iPhone), stand close enough to the sensor to connect via bluetooth and see what it says. Well heck, if I remember to do that I guess I could remember to water. The first time it told me I needed to water, I saw that the (well, it's a tub of lawn grass I grow for my cats) was already sopping wet. I repositioned the sensor and that seemed to help and it's more accurate now, although I'm not really sure how much water to give when it says I need to water and when it tells me more light is needed well, 1.) I had to input a different variety of grass because mine wasn't listed, and mine is a shade-tolerant variety, so I'm not sure it's right and 2.) It's on a balcony and more light just aint gonna happen...at least not until summer. The grass LOOKS healthy, though.I'm a bit confused...if I'm told the plant isn't getting enough light, is that just RIGHT NOW...or am I getting an average from the whole day? I would like to be able to go in and tweak the parameters.The packaging for this is cute but it's WAY overpackaged. It's made to look like a flower growing in a box. If you're giving one as a gift, it would look nice. If you're buying yourself ten of them...annoying.Overall, I think this has some potential since at least the app can be updated at any time to be better...but the bluetooth is a limiting factor, unless I get some kind of firmware update that allows it to connect with my computer that has bluetooth and then from there send me and email or some kind of message when I'm away. Also, I should be able to use it on more than one device (like my iPad AND my iPhone) for the same Flower Power, since I'm sometimes using one and sometimes the other. Also...how well does the fertilizer thing actually work? I dunno...I love to play with weird gadgets and I definitely need help with plants, but I don't know how much I trust this thing."
661,245,5,"I took a chance that the interface of this sprinkler head was compatible with my Scarecrow. The original sprinkler head that was supplied with the Scarecrow (and came apart after several years of use), had a little different sealing method than the Rain Bird, but the Scarecrow's mounting port appeared to be universal, so I ordered the Rain Bird. It works, in fact, it's adjustments make it so much more versatile than the original that it adds to the effectiveness of the Scarecrow."
1549,867,5,"so far so good, after using this product I don'tsee any signs of bugs!!! also likethe fact there's no loud smellproduct works great kinda of costlybut it works"
1558,265,5,These (I bought two  50' and one 100&#34;)  are excellent!  They don't kink--or at least they haven't yet!  They screw into each other smoothly and tightly without having to have the strength of a large man--which is a real helpful thing for a woman with a bit of arthritis in my hands.
769,580,5,"I haven been using this in the front and back yard. This came in handy to cut the bushes in back of the pool. This is light weight and cuts the leaves and small branches in an even stroke, I also like that it is rechargeable and you dont have to worry about adding gas or your clothes smelling like gas.  I can say this is a little gem, Cuts quickly and evenly. takes me less then 15 minutes to do the back yard, where hedges took me an hour,"
521,868,5,Item received quickly and the basket was packed well.  I've never used a hanging basket that had this type of container before that held the soil.  The tag said that it held 50 percent more water and I believe it.  I'm very happy with the look (it's crafted beautifully) and it really does keep the dampness longer than any other container I've used in the past.  The chain link is the perfect length and the basket has 3 sections for the clips on the chain so that the basket stays plumb and level.I will be purchasing a couple for the front porch area.
525,246,5,Chose to get the higher quality connector and I think it paid off. Easy to open and close and the quality is great! Would buy again if needed.
692,365,4,"This chair is very comfortable to lounge in.  But it definitely can't be left outdoors.  After a few weeks of me leaving it on my porch, it has begun to rust in a few spots.It's also not the easiest thing to lug around because once you fold it up, there's nothing to stop it from unfolding if you don't use two hands to carry it.  Some sort of clip or buckle to hold it closed would have been a big plus.I still give it 4 stars with those caveats because of the comfort and appearance.  It would make the perfect chair for taking to the beach or for an enclosed patio, but certainly not a good choice if you plan on keeping it outdoors."
1028,167,2,"It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update."
308,792,3,"For whatever reason, I envisioned this being a lot...bigger.  I will take the hit on that one, but I would venture to say nothing bigger than a finch or a small sparrow or robin is all that will visit this water cooler.  I did not have leaks like other have mentioned and the basin filled just fine...just not that much.The fact that the base is plastic is nice since it wont corrode over time, but by the same token, it does feels extremely cheap."
288,25,4,"This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas]."
80,149,5,I have used this pole saw 4times in the little time I have owned it and it has done everything expected and even more. I am no stranger to the B&D brand name and the products have always served me well. I have a gas chain saw which I use when my feet are on the ground but I never ever go up a tree or ladder with it but I do have need to cut limbs I cannot reach so this battery operated pole saw takes care of that need and does it very well and the best part is the price. Very good product for the price.
867,553,5,"We have several little dogs but sometimes get into the garden so we wanted to get something that was non-toxic. I always worry that the little monsters will get into the garden and lick the plants there.  I feel a little safer now knowing that even if they lick it they won't get hurt.  The spray covers most of types of plants we have in our garden and was more inclusive than some of the specialized sprays by the same company.The product has worked very well on our plants. We spray it on our tomatoes and we haven't seen any bug attacks. The spray doesn't have an unpleasant odor in the fumes don't irritate your eyes or make you feel sick. Be really careful you don't want to use this on plants that are stressed by too much sunlight and not enough water or you can injure/kill them.  Other than that concern, the only real complaint I have is that you have to really spray a lot of the stuff on your plant which uses up the bottle pretty quickly.It's not a stated use, but one thing that we found this useful for was to get rid of some mold. We have some wood near the house that was being eaten away by mold. I tried scraping it off but naturally it would always come back. However, after I sprayed this stuff on it several weeks ago, completely soaking the wood, it seems to have killed it dead.  To our delight there has been no mold growth since then which made us very happy.I really enjoyed this product and I probably would buy it in the future. I don't think it works quite as well as some of the harsh chemical sprays, but it works well enough to do the job and it's much safer so as far as I'm concerned I'm happy with it."
559,206,5,"After being disappointed with the complete and utter lack of any bird activity whatsoever with myPerky-Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder, I had low hopes for the Hummzinger's ability to likewise attract any hummingbirds. To my surprise, today I found a female Anna's hanging out on branches on the trees on either side of the feeder and, a few minutes later, caught her perched on the Hummzinger and dipping her beak into it. So it does work! See my picture to see her sitting at it :DAs regards the other stuff, the Hummzinger is pretty much as foolproof as they come. It consists of three basic parts, the trough/bowl area, the lid, and the handle. The bottom trough holds 12 ounces of fluid (btw, the enclosed instructions tell you the appropriate mixture in case you aren't already aware) along its outer section. The inner center (think of them as separated like a donut) is separated by a thin plastic wall that holds water as an ant guard (more on that). The top, red part snaps onto the trough to hold it secure and, in this model, has four ""flowers"" and perches all around the outer edges. The Hummzinger also comes with nectar guards; for lack of a better word they are essentially little plastic nipples with holes in the center that fit on the underside of the flowers so that hummingbirds can still feed, but insects cannot. Finally, the handle has a hook on the top and can be screwed in and out of the center of the trough. Because this is a potential conduit for ants, the ant guard ensures that any ant that crawls down the handle has to go through the ant guard first to get to the outer rim where the ""nectar"" is...and subsequently drowns.The Hummzinger is super easy to put together and take apart, and is very easy to clean. Even when it is full of liquid it is not very heavy, so it can easily be hung from small tree branches as I have done in my yard. The instruction manual tells you how to put it together, where to place it, how to clean it, how to make nectar, etc. It is as foolproof as they come, and if you want to attract any nearby hummingbirds to your yard, look no further.Note: the instructions that come with the feeder tell you to mix one cup of sugar to four cups of water. Unless you want to store all of that in your fridge, that's way too much. This feeder has a capacity for 12 fluid oz. I typically brew up a mixture of 1/4 cup of sugar to one cup of water, which comes out to 8 fluid oz. by the time it's cool. Keep that in mind when you go to cook up your nectar solution."
814,662,4,"I like this storage seat. It's just the right size, holds lots of garden items that I don't want lying around."
1277,239,4,"They're just like every other wooden mouse trap you've ever seen or set (except maybe the kind with a metal pedal). Several brands distribute these traps, and they work just fine. I tend to prefer mechanical traps over poisons, since there's less chance of something or someone accidentally getting poisoned. The risk then becomes keeping them out of the reach of pets and kids, but I don't find this too difficult.I have caught mice with these traps.One thing to mention: if you look at hardware stores locally, you'll probably find an identical trap much more inexpensively (the last ones I purchased locally were on sale: two traps for a buck). Shipping them from an internet vendor necessarily increases the cost of these lightweight items."
922,805,3,"Glue traps are simultaneously better and worse than snap traps or poison.Glue traps are safer if you have pets and/or children around as pets are less likely to get stuck on them than to eat the sweet-smelling poison (it smells just as good to pets as it does to mice). Even if your pet gets stuck on the glue trap, they are usually bigger than the trap or will bark and indicate for you to free them. Releasing poison from a pet's system is very hard, and often impossible. Even if you set up a bait station that is covered, the mice or rats will go to die elsewhere and your pet might find them and eat them and be exposed to the poison that way.On the other hand, glue traps are not for the faint of heart. With the poison, you will not see where the mouse or rat dies (which is sometimes a problem on itself as you might have a dead, foul-smelling rodent in the house). With these glue traps you will have to face the mouse or the rat and they will usually still be alive when you find that you caught a creature.The rodent will not be able to free itself from the glue trap and will die of starvation, i.e., a slow painful death. Arguably, it's probably no better than bleeding to death from the rat poison or dying from being crushed by a snap trap.Glue traps are also useful to catch crawlers that stumble upon it or walk across it.You must check the traps you set out at least every 24 hours to make sure you are getting rid of the dead animals -- or you can spread infection and no one wants a dead rat in their house."
342,398,4,"I've been using a Weber charcoal grill for over 20 years, and though I think charcoal and wood are the best ways to grill, they're not very convenient, especially when you want to go out and quickly grill a couple of steaks or fish fillets. It takes at least 30-40 minutes to start the fire and preheat the grill. I decided I needed a gas grill.What I really wanted was aWeber 3741001 Genesis E-310 Propane Gas Grill, Black. I've cooked on them, and they're the absolute gold standard for backyard grills as far as I'm concerned. At the same time, $650 was a bit over my budget. I thought about theWeber 4411001 Spirit E-210 Propane Grill, Black, and then I saw this grill for around $50 less. I'd seen the smaller Q grills at home stores and they looked to be of pretty decent quality... so I ordered a Q320, and the optional cover.The grill assembled pretty quickly, despite all the parts. I was a bit concerned that so much of it is plastic, but then plastic doesn't rust, and we get a lot of snow and rain in Michigan. Plastic parts might break, but then, Weber's been around for a long time, and I'm pretty sure spare parts will be available for the reasonable future. If I keep the cover on it should last. I'm also just a little concerned about the disposable aluminum drip pan- it's an odd size, which pretty much locks you into the Weber replacements, but they're not very expensive, and should be available for a long time. If not, you could probably make something out of heavy-duty aluminum foil that would work in a pinch.The photos make it appear as if the Q320 has an enclosed lower section, which it doesn't. There's a flexible plastic sheet that hides the Propane tank from view, but there's nothing structural about it. If that's a concern, the Spirit 220, which has a steel enclosure under the grill,  might be a better choice. I'm already half tempted to remove the sheet, roll it up, and put it in the basement.The burner design on the 320 is a little different from most grills. There are two burners, but one runs around the outer perimeter, and one runs down the middle of the grill. Normally, both are used to heat the entire surface of the grill, but the outer burner alone can be used for indirect grilling- very handy for doing a chicken or turkey, or maybe even smoking. (The manual doesn't say anything about smoking but I suspect you could do it.) Another nice touch is the front mounted thermometer, attached with stainless steel hardware.So far I've roasted a half dozen peppers, and I was impressed with how easy the grill lit, and how fast it heated up. The construction- cast aluminum, stainless steel and plastic, for the most part- means it should be rust free for a long time. I'll try to update this review in six month or a year, but so far I'm pretty happy with my purchase.UPDATE: It's been almost a year, and I'm still very happy with the grill. Last night I grilled marinated shrimp and potatoes for two; a few weeks ago I grilled hamburgers for 30. The grill was able to handles all these jobs with no problems.Update 2: It's now been in regular use for over three years, with no problems, and it still looks like new."
18,283,4,"I've been a longtime fan of Safer products in my garden, so I was eager to try the Pantry Pest Trap indoors. Some nasty little moths had found a ride indoors, perhaps in a bag of pet food, and were lurking about the kitchen.The Pantry Pest Traps are set up in locations where I thought they might catch these pests, but so far I have seen no trapped moths. I'll continue to use these traps for a few more weeks, as there are few alternatives that are safe in the kitchen."

349,490,4,The mice at my house are completely ignoring these traps. The trap is very easy to bait and set  and the traps  are safe for pets and children.  Unfortunately our  mice ignore these traps so they have not helped with our mouse infestation. We have also put out some poison packs.  Water traps and a rent a cat are next.
1596,628,1,"I think I've tried everything now to get rid of fungus gnats.  This stuff didn't do much if anything.  The yellow stickies caught bunches but barely slowed them.  I let the plants dry until nearly dead, I tried teas, spices, soaps, Neem, and everything else I found or heard about. I finally got rid of them by scraping off the top 1"" layer of soil and replacing it with sand."
1496,764,4,"I've only used this a couple of times, but I've found it easy to use and while not as powerful as a corded leaf blower, it does work well for blowing loose material (leaves, sawdust, etc).  Leaves that I left over winter in my flower beds will not budge.  It was perfect for cleaning the walks and the deck.  It's lightweight and easy to carry for long lengths of time.  It does have an air intake on the left side and being right-handed, I was constantly getting my pantleg vacuumed against it.  It's much quieter than my corded blower, so I feel comfortable that I'm not disturbing the neighbors much when I use it.  Both times I've used it, I was able to get the job done without the battery running down.  I haven't had the chance to see just how long it will run on a full charge, but I'd say that I used it each time for at least 15-20 minutes with no change in power."
1243,684,5,These little babies are the way to go. I love the fact that I can monitor the temp of both the meat and the smoker. Very convenient and essential to anybody serious about grilling or smoking. It comes with some short 3' leads but you can upgrade and buy some 6' versions if you like. So far so good and I've been using it every weekend since I've purchased my Weber Smokey Mountain about 2 months ago.
1430,837,3,"The box for the Goal Zero Switch 8 Solar Recharger states that it should charge in 5 hours (using a solar charger like the Nomad 3.5) and then charge a smartphone in one hour.  Or the Goal Zero can be charged by any USP port in 4 hours.  There are 4 blue lights on the side of the Goal Zero Recharger to indicate the amount of charge available.I found that the Goal Zero was slower than specified. When I received the unit it displayed 2 blue lights indicating that it was about 50% charged. I plugged it into my 6 watt solar charger similar to thePortable Solar Charger- StrongVolt SOLAR:7- Charges iPhones, Androids, Tablets, eReaders, All USB Devices- Great Portable Solar Power for Emergency Kits (One-Year Warranty).  I let it charge for 3 hours on a sunny winter afternoon.  Then I checked and it still only had 2 blue lights come on.  Then I plugged the Goal Zero into my Motorola USB wall charger and the weight of the Goal Zero pulled it out of the charger so that it didn't receive a charge.  I then plugged it into my computer and charged it over several hours to get 4 lights.The first time I plugged the fully charged Goal Zero Recharger into my new Moto X smartphone I wasn't impressed.  My phone had a 70% charge and after an hour my phone had a 68% charge and the display indicated it wasn't charging.The next test I ran was to play a movie on my phone for an hour. The phone's battery dropped from 66% to 50%. Then I recharged my phone to 66% and plugged in the Goal Zero. After playing the movie again for an hour the battery went from 66% to 72% with the Goal Zero. I also did another test without the movie playing and the Goal Zero charged my phone from 13% to 71% in an hour, and again at the end of the hour my phone indicated that it was not charging.So the Goal Zero could be useful in situations where you don't have access to a charger, but the Goal Zero may not be the optimal solution."
1680,418,1,"Nothing but flimsy cardboard shoved inside cheap plastic. If you have slippers or sandles, you'll be OK..... butanything more, forget it. I'm looking to replace this piece of garbage. Save your money and put it toward something more substantial.......not this."
101,885,4,"compact and convenient, this lightweight solar panel can handily assist you with lightweight charging needs and can even run a few accessories without an attached battery(for example, i use mine with a lightweight fan for a cooling breeze while sitting on the beach; any USB-based fan or an 'O2Cool' fan [found in local drugstores or box-marts] will do)i have to credit w/goal zero; there is at last a clear, concise and comprehensive online product guide to help a solar newbie with making proper choices for one's panel and accessory needs - BUT, simply clicking on the accessories page will not help you decide on what to buy for your panel - and more pertinent to this product, there is no clear and concise information to show what you need in order to or what you need to 'chain' several of these smaller panels together (i make my own cables to bump up the USB amperage for charging my handheld radio transceivers, or to run small high-frequency transceivers via the solar output port)i like the compact size and versatility of the Nomad 7, but if you have an older version you should know a few things:1. the regulator and ports have been moved to the back of the panel - this is an improvement, as heat from the sun has been a known problem w/the original2. the pouch area is now larger, on the back, and uses a mesh3. all cables are attached, so nothing can be lost, but you will need to construct a female and/or male adapter if you want to do custom cabling4. dimensions of the panel are the samei took off one star for failure of the manufacturer to offer any comprehensive chaining or cabling information for this panel, despite chaining being touted as a feature, and a marked port on the panel itself 'Chain input' - the included instructions state: &#34;Can I chain multiple solar panels together? Yes. Chaining additional solar panels is a great way to charge your device from the sun in less time.&#34; - well thanks for that, but there are NO pictures, NO schematics, NO info or name of a required accessory cable to chain this panel - this is a MAJOR omission on the part of goal zero - sorry folks!all in all though, i think you'll be pleased with this product, and if you have an older Nomad, this updated version... if you have the acumen to do your own cables you may be able to chain this panel with your older one - but don't expect to easily find any info from the manufacturer on doing so - get out your volt meter and soldering iron!"
209,432,3,"I had intended to use this mole spike this summer to repel moles at a choke point were two concrete walls narrow down to about 15 feet apart.  If the moles are kept from entering between those walls my garden will be safe.  It is a little early for mole activity in my area, just starting to warm up, but the new Vine Program deadline for reviews is 30 days so I can't wait to see if any moles do get past this mole spike.  The device seems adequately made and was easy enough to push into the ground so I have my fingers crossed in hopes that the sound emitted will be offensive to the moles.  I can't give any more than 3 stars at this time because I don't think any moles are active to be repelled yet.July 18, 2013 update - I just finished watering my garden and discovered water running out of a collapsed mole burrow about 10 feet from the edge of the garden.  This MAY BE an old burrow from last year however ???  I haven't seen any fresh dirt from digging and that is a good. the Mole & Gopher Spike is still making noise periodically."
913,140,4,"I bought this item to start seeds and try my hand at cloning for the first time.  In both regards it has performed to my satisfaction.  A few points:- The dome is thin plastic.  I mean like solo cup thin.  It wouldn't take much to completely destroy it.  My small accurite thermo sitting on top makes a nice dent in it.- It leaks.  The condensate on the dome rolls down the sides and out of the edges.  This could have been easily fixed by making the dome fit inside the base instead of the outside.  Try not to put anything you don't want wet underneath this.- The heat mat, despite being several layers of plastic below the grow chamber, keeps a nice amount of warmth and humidity in the dome.  On last measurement I was at 89% RH and 81 degrees with half the top vent open.  The ambient temperature of my basement is around 65f.- It's big!  From the picture it just doesn't look all that impressive, but when you get the box you realize this guy is pretty large.  Make sure and check the dimensions!- The holes for the inserts fit rapid rooters perfectly!Following some simple direction was all that was needed to achieve successful results using this item.  I filled the base of the item with Ph adjusted water just to where the bottoms of the cups were submerged.  Soaked my rapid rooters in Ph adjusted water as well and dropped my seeds/clones in.  Plugged in the heat mat and set it under my 2ft T-5 fixture.  Within a week I spotted a few seeds germinating, and my clones looked just as good as the day I clipped them.  A week after that my clones had put on a decent amount of roots.  Mostly I have been screwing around with cloning just to see if I could do it, and I am 20 for 20 thus far.I think the real trick is to just leave the damn thing alone.  The more people fiddle around with the top off the more time it takes building up the humid environment again.  That's my trick anyways and it seems to be paying off.  I will only take the top off when it is time to transplant.I read several negative reviews about this item before I purchased it, and for the most part they are correct.  Despite being happy with this product I deducted a star because of the slight water leakage.  I mean there is a electrical device sitting under this thing that leaks water.  I'm no electrical engineer, but common sense tells me that one should take precautions when using this thing.Once again though it is the price that makes me recommend this.  You aren't going to find anything even close to this price that has the utility of this item."
656,364,5,"I find most CARB-compliant gas cans to be difficult to use and cause more spillage, but this one is easy to use. The 2.5-gallon size is perfect for me for typical small home gardening equipment like gas trimmer and lawn mower. I find the bigger 5-gallon size too heavy, so I use two of this 2.5-gallon size. This allows me to always keep one can filled with gas if one goes empty, and gas lasts longer because of less air space in the smaller can (less air = less moisture = less water contamination)."
31,432,2,"I like the idea of this product, I have used similar, non-solar spikes in the past with great success.  They seem to work but installing and caring for them is made very difficult by the solar panel on the top of the spike.  It is hard to install these without being able to hammer them into the ground at some point, and the tops are way too fragile for that.  We managed to get them into the ground by making a sizable hole and then burying them but that seems like it would impact their effectiveness.  One of the four has already broken -- my dog hit it while chasing a tennis ball.  Probably best to just go for the battery powered version."
196,928,4,"I used the bag on my back yard.  I don't have a spreader, but I used a large disposable cup and shook it out by hand.  It distributed well. The wind was blowing, so I stayed with the wind to my back.  The granules are yellow and were easy to see in the grass so I wouldn't go back over the same area.  This would be helpful even with a spreader.  It does not have a strong odor.  I'll have to edit my review to update how it does.ETA:  I was expecting rain the evening after I put this down.  It didn't happen for 4 more days!  There was no burning.  I've also noticed the grass is growing faster now in the back yard, where I put this, than it is in the front yard, which didn't get treated."
1267,874,2,"Miracle Gro really has a great idea here with the Gro-Ables Salad and Herb Garden.  Each pod contains seed, growing mix, and plant food, so all you need to do is stick it in the ground and water.  Each cup of dirt and seed is like a compostable K-Cup. However, you're really paying a lot for the cost of ""semi-convenience"" here.Buying the starts for a globe tomato, cherry tomato, cucumber, pepper, basil, cilantro, and dill will probably set you back anywhere between $7-21 at a nursery, BUT you'll be guaranteed a live plant that is a couple of weeks old.  You'll also get more varieties of some of the plants (such as heirloom tomatoes like Yellow Jubilee, Black Krim, etc).  Also, you can bypass buying plants you simple won't use.  I personally have no use for dill or cilantro, and would rather grow a yellow variety of tomato instead of the cherry tomato.Some of the plants listed here simply need more than a single plant to do well/yield well.  A single bush bean will not feed a single person, let alone a family.  Five heads of lettuce won't last long either.  That said, the bush bean, lettuce varieties, snap pea and spinach plants just don't make sense to have as single plants.  You'd be better off spending the buck each to buy full packages of these seeds to plant yourself.  You'll be ahead of the game in case one of the seeds in the Miracle Gro batch doesn't sprout.  Offhand, the Miracle Grow pea I planted faired about as well as the full package of peas I planted in the garden.That said, yes, this set does offer an almost fail-proof method of growing your own food.  If given the choice however, I would sooner purchase starts, or full packages of seeds instead of paying for the convenience of these seeds.  You'll have more variety, a good jump start with starters, and better luck with a seed in a cup of dirt - and if that seed should fail, at least you'll have a package more to test with."
310,150,4,"Sure, this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose, but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends, but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather, rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose, but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;."
738,92,4,"This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4"" to 2x 6"" inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a ""bumper"" which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck, balcony or fence. Recommended."
820,713,5,"This company makes a number of disposable mouse bait stations, but this one is designed to be refilled.  Just make sure to wear gloves as you don't want to get the poison on your hands.

793,794,4,"This feeder is very nice looking and simple to set up. I have filled the feeder with sugar water and set it out for the birds and so far haven't seen any. I did find some ants visiting it, so it needed to be moved. Once it is settled into a better place I am hoping the hummingbirds will find it and begin to use it. The feeder is exactly as pictured and seems to be very good quality so I don't have any problem recommending this feeder to anyone with hummingbirds in the area and who can keep it away from the ants."
752,859,4,This set worked perfectly for our little old mower. I loved having all the components there. It is a great way to teach a kid about engine maintenance. I had no problem using it. It seems as cost effective to me as purchasing the various elements separately and I didn't have to worry about forgetting anything.
1213,573,1,"If you have a GS 40, this cover will not work.  Also, the cover seems to be cheaply made from flisy material, definitely not worth the money.  I bought a cover for a small Char Grill propane grill, much higher quality cover for less money and works very well on the GS 40."
471,313,5,This thing has done great so far. It survived the winter well indoors. I may plant it in the backyard this year and see how hardy it really is.
1507,468,3,"I found evidence of a rat in my attic and purchased one of these traps at Lowes.  Loaded it up with some peanut butter and left it where a rat had chewed on some boxes we had in the attic just above our garage.  Not two hours later, I just happened to be in the garage almost directly under the trap when I heard it fire and then a bunch of noise.  I knew two things... I had something... and it was dead yet.  I loaded up for battle, headlamp, gloves, eye protection and a respirator and pulled down the attic door/ladder not knowing what to expect when I poked my head up.  Sure enough, there it was, with tail it was about 1 foot long and it's head was stuck in and trying to get out.  I grabbed the trap and took him outside and finished the job.  I would have rather not been involved in the killing process, but I'm happy that within two hours of setting the trap, I got my target.  I never expected it to work that quickly and can sleep in peace knowing there's not something chewing away at my possessions.I reset the trap in case he/she had friends, but so far it's been quiet."
249,597,2,"I live in New England was bought this for a christmas gift. Each snow fall I used this with I was not very happy. I could shovel faster than this thing works (with more effort granted). The ability to angle the snow in a particular direction was just above worthless. Half the snow you are angling always ends up going right in front of you. The problem with this, is that this is only rated for 6 inches of snow (though I have used it up to a foot) but as you push the snow you inevitably end up putting the snow right back in front of you adding inches to the snow you are trying to move.I like the idea of electric snow blowers and think it would be a great use for me but without the ability to direct the snow properly this becomes alot more work than necessary in heavy snow. Keep the snow less than 6 inches and you wont have too much of a problem.I do not recommend this product and would never buy this tool for myself. I will be buying the greenworks 12 amp snow thrower to replace this one."

1414,895,5,"The Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food Advanced Starter Kit contains one (1) garden feeder, one (1) sixteen (16) fluid ounce bottle of LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food, and one (1) dosing spoon (for dispensing the food from a watering can).  The LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food is appropriate for use on plants which are in-ground and those which are planted in containers.  The sprayer/garden feeder is handy for application over larger areas.  I use a watering can with a measured quantity of food when applying in smaller areas or to plants in containers.  Recommend."
107,674,3,"Out of a 2 pack of two, the first package of two traps caught hundreds of moths - it is quite cruel - the little moths struggle for a while to get free before they die.  But the two traps in the second package caught a total of two - one trap caught not a single moth.  I think the pheromones must have been expired, or faulty - perhaps they should include extras.  Also the directions don't make it clear if the little pheromone patch has to be stuck onto the trap with one side or the other up or if it doesn't matter.  So I don't know whether to recommend these or not - I think not until they get the quality control perfected. I got one package for the price of two since the second one didn't work."
464,509,5,"Well so far we had none of the problems the other reviewers have had. It works great, retracts the wheel, and its quite cool and handy. I love the storage box. We got one for the front of house and now are getting one for the back. We had no trouble or leaks with hook up, and again works and retracts perfectly. I love the box idea, can place things on top and it keeps it nice and neatly, tucked away.I will update my review accordingly in a few more months seeing how they work out. I hope it doesn't turn out like the other reviewers. For what its worth we did purchase a no tangle hose which we use with the reel, not sure if that makes a difference or not? In either case ours from last year works great still and we are on to our second one."
324,553,5,I have a sun problem at my home. There is none. All the trees are to large. So I also have a fungus problem that comes with the lack of intense sun. I sprayed the dirt and containers with this to see if I can rid the early fungal growth and it seems to be working great! I will update later in the season on how the insect control works. I'm happy that I do not have an early fungus issue this year so far!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
610,150,5,"This is a heavy-weight hose and heavy-duty. I already had purchased the 100foot one for my backyard and like it very much. It doesn't kink and it seems to be well made enough to last a few years before I'll need to replace it. This one is made with the same quality. It doesn't kink and it appears well made enough to last. I put it in my front yard where it gets regular use and it is doing what it is supposed to do, so I have no issues with it. In fact, if you are looking for a heavy duty hose that won't kink and will stand up to regular use, I have no problem recommending this one. In fact, as time goes by I'll probably be purchasing another one for my side yard, just haven't decided what size to get yet. It is a bit pricey, but I think it is worth it. It is made out of recycled materials and you can't drink from it, but that is to be expected now a days. Again, it is a heavy hose, so I wouldn't recommended it to those that are frail, arthritic or weak. Moving it around will wear you out. Other than that, it stretches out easily; you don't have to fight with it.Tip: uncoil it and lay it where you want before turning the water on. If you leave it coiled up, then turn the water on and try to move it about it will be like moving an iron pipe. It becomes rigid when the water flows through it."
532,922,5,"I have used the Shake n Feed solutions from Miracle Grow for years.  This one is for flowers and blooms and they have others with different ratios for different plants.  This is so easy to use and really no worries about over doing it as this is continuous release in little balls and the dispenser really helps in portioning this out slowly.  This is definitely my go to product for feeding plants, I have several of their line in my greenhouse."
1203,722,5,I was anxious to get this and try it out. As I have gotten older lifting heavy pots is more difficult. The weight due in part to the layer of stone in the bottom of a pot for drainage. These worked great!! However you will need to learn how much to water as they do not drain as fast as pots with stone in them. They are very durable and thick. Easy to handle. You can cut to size if  needed.  A little pricey but they will last a long time I would  highly recommend these .
482,104,5,"I like to grow herbs indoors, and save a ton of money by starting flowers and veggies inside, 3 months before I can move 'em outdoors.I've had the Hydrofarm Jump Start for a couple of weeks, and already have some pretty little green heads pushing up from the Jiffy peat pellets.Some have said that the metal bars were flimsy, but that's not what I found. They're more than adequate for the job, and fit together easily enough.It's a bit confusing when the company talks about ""bulbs"" - plural - since there is only 1 fluorescent tube supplied, or that could fit in the highly reflective holder.This is an energy-efficient T5 fluorescent tube - one of the new, skinny kind. I'm used to seeing the standard store type - the T12's - which are big around as a silver dollar (and are being phased out). This one would have a diameter more like a quarter. You can replace them easily enough at your local hardware/home supply store - I checked.This is just the 4-foot lighting system: I also ordered a company's Germination Station, Heat Mat and Digital Thermostat (sold separately).I'd say this was a well thought out device, relatively simple, sturdy enough, and works well.Recommended!"
850,497,5,"this thing is awesome!  It makes an amateur BBQ guy like me seem like a pro.  if you follow the instructions, you can't go wrong.  this is SO much easier than trying to smoke something on a manual weber charcoal grill.  assembly is very easy, and just remember, if you are having a tough time keeping the temp in the range you want, use the water bowl level to help keep it steady.  for example, the more water you have in the bowl, the lower and more stable you can keep the temp.  I use big chunks of wood rather than the little chips, and it works great.  just remember, every time you remove the lid, you will add a little to your cook time, but that thermometer on the lid works great and makes it so you don't ever have to remove the lid until the very end.don't waste your time or money on other products, if you can afford it, get this smoker.  you won't regret it, well, that is, unless you get really fat from eating BBQ, then you might regret it, but still..."
38,200,5,great deal...seven bucks and I could not find one for under twenty bucks at the local hardware stores very happy. Just bought another one.
690,912,5,"I have owned a large Q300 for years. This review is for BOTH the Q1200 and somewhat larger Q2200, just smaller versions and without the stand or 20 pound propane cylinder.  The Q1200 and Q2200 are identical other than a somewhat smaller size with one over the other. I would recommend you buy the optional Weber Q Adapter Hose and a 20 pound Propane tank for either. Mine last a year with a LOT of use on our larger Q300 model and you will save a fortune on the disposable, portable, VERY expensive litle cylinders. Even if traveling I would use the 20 pound tank, it simply just works best for us.So why do I need 3 grills anyway? Well I recently have lost the use of my legs and even with leg braces, sometimes can't even stand, much less walk.  So what may seem extravagant at first, is really not at all. The Q300 on it's factory stand is now just too tall if in my wheelchair or Mobility Scooter the wife just bought me for Christmas. It is a Pride Victory Sport 4 wheel model and I am able to swivel the seat to face to ANY direction.  I use the Q2200 on the front patio concrete table (nice and LOW for me and drive right up to it, swivel my seat directly to the grill and off I go.  SO easy and I still get to participate, not just mope around feeling useless... I bought a cheapo dolly on wheels to carry the extra 20 pound propane cylinder we bought since the one in the big Q300 is a nightmare (for ME) to take in and out each time if switching grills. The Q300 is for when family or neighbors come over then THEY get to do the cooking and work!So why that dolly with wheels for the 2 smaller grills? Well I have a large hot tub out in the back yard and instead of moving ALL the stuff if I want to cook at the hot tub I simply bought a cheap little table (LOW!) next to that tub. I hook my dolly/cart and pull it like a trailer with that 20 pound propane (extra tank), simply connect 1 line end to the Q1200 and off I go. If not disabled I know it may not make good sense? But for ME? It is like getting a little piece of my life back. I am not buying covers for these smaller grills since my large one on the Q300 has the top just about rotted off from sun damage. I now place a towel over the top of that cover and should have thought about that years ago. The 2 smaller grills seem to be made of exact same materials and I see no reason to even bother covering but will just fit a small piece of plastic tarp over them if it EVER rains here in Southern California! (Camp Pendleton area). We have had weather in the 80's all this month of January....There really is no assembly to speak of compared to the nightmare I had with the Q300.  In fairness, I suppose it wasn't all that hard either but with the stand and at that time I was just beginning to fight with disability, it kinda kicked my behind. I did have a problem with the Q2200 with the igniter electrode assembly. Could not get that sucker to spark!  It would light with a match but no other way. My Q300 has NEVER missed a beat so I called customer service. If you ever have to do so, be prepared for a shock. An American IN America will answer the phone, speak perfect English and be very helpful! I know, it seems like a likely story right. Even I thought maybe it was the pain medication:-)  Long story short, the woman was SUPER nice and said she would RUSH a new igniter electrode assembly. I went back and did the assembly of the other Weber and it worked fine. So I keep tinkering with this and found a wire not properly seated. I checked that prior for what seemed like a dozen time but guess I air headed it and flat missed it or who knows what. I called back l later to explain I did NOT need that part but it was already ""processed"". I told her I would ship it back at my expense and she told me to keep it for a spare! So America IS still alive and well. At least with some companies anyway. I will continue to be a Weber customer for life as I have been all along.I normally never give a 5 star rating right off the bat for ANY product. I have written hundreds of reviews and don't believe in going on some honeymoon rant about how amazing a product is in the first 10 minutes of use, have it burst into flames or fall apart in a hundred pieces then never go back to correct that review. But this product is different. It is essentially (BOTH the Q1200 and Q2200) just junior versions of my old and trusty Q300. I couldn't ask for more. It has served me well, the company has proven itself to me to be simply amazing at caring for it's customers AFTER sale. I would give 10 stars if I could. Weber has earned that from me and done it the old fashioned way. With quality products, and quality service.I would end with only this. If you are not disabled you may want to consider their optional stand? If not, at least just remember to NOT set it on something that may melt or catch fire:-) Trust me, I have accidentally grilled a couple really nice plastic tables UNDER my grill in my time....My concrete table work just great for me now however."
180,620,5,"This composter was easy to assemble, simple to use and seems reasonably sturdy.  The price was very competitive.  The lid locks closed.  It has two side doors to take the composed soil out.  It is decent size, but does fill up fast if you cover the compost with dirt."

623,265,5,"Our lot is roughly 10,000 square feet, and this hose is just the right length - long enough to reach almost all our gardens/plants, but short enough that it's light and easy to carry around.It seems well made, doesn't kink too easily, and seems to have quality connections/o-rings (no leaks).Also a good price. Highly recommended."
1147,807,4,"I have a basement furnace that sends hot air to a single output vent, centrally located. There is one room that is away from the main area to which we sent a duct from the central location. Unfortunately, given the obvious issues (air will travel along the route that has no back pressure preferentially, and the single large output vent is preferable to the duct), the duct alone doesn't bring in very much heat and a booster fan should solve the problem.Fortunately, the output of the duct is nearby to a wall AC outlet and so this particular model, with its cord already attached, is perfect for my setup. A few sheet-metal screws later, the fan is mounted and we've got plenty of heat coming through. A couple of issues remain. First is that you probably won't want the fan running all the time, and second is the noise. This is not a quiet component.Running the fan to a switched outlet will solve the first problem, but having a rheostat in line with it might solve both. This is a powerful enough fan (drawing about half an amp) that turning down the power should result in still getting significant flow while cutting the noise considerably. Some of the noise is the fan motor itself - you can deal with that by wrapping an insulator around the outside of the motorized section of duct. Some of the noise is simply the air blowing through the duct and out the end. That will be cut by reducing the flow speed. There's nothing here that isn't straight-forward, and I'd rather start out with too much power than too little."
354,939,4,"We buy a new feeder every year.  I know that they can be washed and reused, but after a season they all fade out and look bad.  This is a good feeder and so far the Hummingbirds like it as much as any that we have had.  With all things being equal as far as the birds are concerned the real secret for a good feeder is how easy it is to use and refill.This feeder has an easy fill container.  The lid comes off easily, but also feels very secure.  So far we haven't had any leaks and as advertised it hasn't attracted insects. Its as good as any feeder that I have bought."
635,787,1,"I was really excited about getting this trimmer with all the great reviews. Several problems for me. First I hated the fact that I had to hold down the saftey switch the entire time or it cuts off. My arms were very tired just from having to hold down that stupid saftey switch. Also battery didn't last very long even on a regular sized yard. The charger also kept saying battery too warm even when it wasn't warm. Also didn't find the auto feed helpful. Lastly, very weak power. I returned mine and went and bought a Craftsman 4 cycle gas weedwhacker with electric start(no mixing of oil and gas, electric start so no pulling, starts right up, awesome power, and has a simple no hazzle weed cord that only takes ten seconds to change out and so far have weed eated entire yard and haven't had to change the weed cord yet. Anyway, I don't usually recommend other products in my reviews but in this case I did because I don't think any other brand of gas weedeaters have this electric start and no oil mixing except for the Craftsman 4 cycle weedwhacker.Craftsman gas is alittle heavier but buy a $10 shoulder strap on you will be fine. My arms are less tired using the gas craftsman and took one fifth the amount of time and energy than we I used the toro electric."
184,504,4,"If you have a large number of mice, this solution may the one for you, as it's rather potent in that scenario.  If you only have a small issue, then perhaps it can be bettered by simpler solutions, as the overhead (in terms of up front costs and batteries) doesn't lend itself to smaller issues.I have a problem that falls more into the former than the latter, and the price couldn't be beat, so I took the plunge.  Within a couple days mice started to disappear, and it's all so bizarrely efficient compared to mechanical or chemical solutions.  I almost felt evil even using this thing, but the results and simplicity (the included instructions and batteries helped that) swayed me.  Now that things have waned, it's become a bit less attractive compared to other options, but it's already paid for itself."
1322,93,3,"I've had success corralling the little buggers with the two-dollar Tip Trap and the pricier Smart Mouse House, but they catch only one mouse at a time, and I have yet to find a plastic trap that, after the 3rd or 4th use, the critter hasn't gnawed his way out of (my mice chew through plastic like it was cheese).  On the other hand, this Havahart device frankly befuddles me (maybe the mouse as well).  If I had a couple of hours to devote to it, I might be to figure out how to set the matrix of wires ""just so"" for both ends of the trap to spring shut (why 2 ends?).  I've got enough time to take the little creatures on Sunday drives into the country, but getting the hang of this gadget is beyond my skills and/or patience.  If you consider yourself a ""pro"" with a heart, maybe this'll pan out.  I'm returning mine and going with another fragile, plastic green ""crack house.""  (It works quite well for the first 2-3 weeks, before the mouse has ripped it to shreds.)"
691,496,5,The Magna Cart is perfect for anyone needing a hand truck. It is small enough to fold up and leave by the back door and hefty enough to hold two 40 pound cartons of liter. I have six cats and usually get 2 of the 40 pound cartons of litter when they are on sale. These are very heavy and the Magna Cart is perfect for carrying the litter from the car to the litter box.I also use the Magna Cart for carrying cartons of drinks and groceries into the house.  The handle is adjustable and easy to slide into place. It is very strong. I am very pleased with my purchased. I highly recommend this cart.
731,920,5,"I am not much of a meat eater, but I serve it to guests and and love slow cooking pulled barbeque. These claws are the best thing to come along for that task than anything I can remember.When I was offered a review sample I thought they were cast iron - it turns out they are nylon, but are as strong as any metal utensils I have used. They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed. So nuch so that I intend to recommend a pair to family and friends because they and not only handy, but essential if you prepare shredded or pulled barbeque."
1659,796,5,"This is one of my favorite hummingbird feeders. It's well-made, easy to fill, easy to clean, and the hummingbirds love it. The ""flowers"" are large so the birds can't miss it. I really appreciate the non-drip aspect. I can hang it over the patio and don't need to worry about a sticky mess below it.The ant trip is small and the water evaporates quickly, but I've learned to put a sticky goo on the hook that holds the feeder and the ants can't get past that anyway.The sugar solution lasts about two weeks at my house (I have another feeder, too), and that's about the time it needs a good cleaning.Keep an eye out for the ""S"" hanger that's taped to the inside of the top.All-in-all, a nice feeder that holds a large amount of feed."
506,653,5,"Well I would have to say that this is a well designed feeder. The red top lifts right off for adding nectar or for cleaning. Cleaning often is a must because the nectar spoils in hot weather. The center holds water to keep the ants away and some birds get a drink. I have mine hanging from a sheppards hook outside of my kitchen window. I can top off the water well by shooting my sink sprayer through the window screen. At this point you may be thinking that I am lazy, but that's a different review. Now back on subject, I also coated a six inch portion of the sheppard's hook with vaselene about two feet up. Ants don't like vaselene. The directions on the nectar said to use a higher concentration to initially attract the birds. Last year I bought my mother a pretty glass one at Lowes and that one turned out to be hard to use and not so good. You may think it is just a waste of time because you have never seen hummming birds in your area. I also thought that. After the first month with the feeder, two hummers found it and they are at the feeder every day."
483,922,3,"This plant food is composed of 9% Nitrogen, 18% Phosphate, 9% soluble Potash, 20% Sulfur. I have used it for several years on my roses, and they've done well. I love the slow-release formula, which reduces the risk of over feeding. In this container there is enough food for 135 sq. ft.In the past I have spread the food by hand to ensure even distribution. This container has spikes on the lid, so when the food is shaken out the spikes break up the flow and divides the food a bit. It is a far better lid that those in the past which just dumped the food in one place, however distribution is still far from perfect, and an aerator of some sort is necessary to ensure truly even distribution. Therefore, it is personal preference whether you think this container is worth the extra purchase price."
1642,9,4,"-Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted. The retail price is even more out there so I'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half, but still expensive per roll."
1540,276,5,"A good feeder for oil sunflower. Sturdy all metal, like another I own that has lasted over a decade. First bird arrived within a few hours. Often it takes a while for birds to get comfortable with a new feeder. This 5-tier was placed within a grove of 4 other feeders.No assembly required. Easy lift top filling. It holds enough to last for days and days.My other all metal sunflower seed feeder has no perch rings like this NO/NO brand feeder. Birds like to perch to eat. Even hummingbirds prefer that if available, but of course this feeder will attract no hummingbirds.Oil sunflower seed attracts finch, cardinal, woodpecker, jay, chickadee, redwing, bluebird, titmouse, nuthatch, and several, including doves, like to eat what's been dropped to the ground. Many of my birds first perch in the trees or bushes nearby and sing each time they feed, announcing to others of their kind of the windfall buffet. It's a grand life, being retired and watching birds. The patio swing is where I read all the books I review. God's flying critters offer bliss.My habitat includes a small pond, a water source is another bird draw. Running water is best. They say birds can hear water splash two miles away. I hand feeders near trees and bushes (birds like that) and use auto grease on the lower part of the shepherd's hooks to keep raiding (and feeder destroying) squirrels and raccoons from being able to climb.My bird feeding is serious. I feed year round and even write a column about wildlife in a small hometown newspaper. This feeder ranks high on quality and durability. With a 5 pound capacity, it means fewer trips for refilling, and more just sitting on the patio watching. This feeder is worthy of the investment in bird-watching delight."
630,701,5,"My garden was full of small red ants this year.  They seem to have had a population explosion everywhere in our area.  After I received this product to try, I decided to test it in my fenced and lined garden area because it would be easier to observe there.The product design is great for use outdoors and was very simple to setup and activate.  Just pull the two stakes out, position the bait unit, press down on the central container and give it a twist.  The stakes can be used to secure the unit in place, but don't have to be used.The package contained 6 units and my garden has 5 raised bed areas.  I also have several large container plants in the garden.  I placed one unit in each of the 5 raised beds and the last unit in one of the large pots.Although I didn't notice a lot of activity or interest in the bait traps, the ants were using it.  Within a few days, raised beds that were filthy with ants are now without ant activity.Really impressed by the product design.  It can be secured into place, protects itself from weather and the openings that allow the ants in to get the bait are very small.It worked so well and was so effortless that I wanted to get more of it, but it is listed as currently unavailable.  A seller has it listed here, but the shipping charges are too high to justify buying it from them.Hope I'm able to find this locally because it works."
123,858,4,"This is a smart set. If you are like us, chances are you have bits of this and that hanging around the shed; motor oil here, spark plug there, drain pan somewhere...you get the idea. The first thing you will notice is the container is a funnel and drain pan. It's a smart idea since this actually serves a purpose and is sized right. Next, the spark plug, filter and fluid is all packed inside and designed so you can do maintenance all at once. The value seems solid especially compared to buying each individually and I like the time saving aspect. I got two because we actually have a couple of mowers - one we use for personal and one we use for rentals. Both arrived in good order, both are convenient and both seemed well priced."
58,140,4,"When I first opened the package, I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece, this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest, so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on, I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again, although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks."
1117,272,5,"The feeder has a very attractive red finish, is very easy to fill, and its perch is large enough for multiple birds at the same time. The perch is also wide enough to hold seed that comes out of the feeder without much falling to the ground, except in the case of squirels. But then what feeder is completely immune to squirrels?  When not using, you can fold it flat to store easily. When you want to use it, just hold it upright by its handle and it immediately unfolds.  It is designed to hold larger seeds like sunflower seeds, so it is not for use with smaller seeds, as they will fall out.We have many different types of birds and bird feeders in our yard.  Although we have yet to see a cardinal, we have seen birds on this feeder, depsite other feeders being available.  We are hoping the word gets out to cardinals so they can join our menagerie of birds.  I think this feeder is a good buy."
363,224,5,"After I fixed my blunder of setting the bird feeder on the Nyger Seed setting while I had regular bird seed in the vessel, all has been delightful.  Watching the birds is so relaxing.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other saying &#34;it took long enough to figure out the feeder has two settings!&#34;  The instructions mention this, but I overlooked it."
102,384,5,This is an extremely effective and well made grill brush. I highly recommend it.
1145,490,5,"I've been using the &#34;humane&#34; traps for a while now, but recently the mice have somehow found a way to claw out of the lid.  Finally got fed up and got these instead.  Worked overnight, quick, easy, and painless.  You don't see the gory mess afterwards because the lid automatically pops up after a catch, at most you'll see a tail."
1661,432,4,"OMG, this is cool! It really works! Every year at this time we get tons of moles. We live in Northern California near the Redwood Parks, and boy do we get hit with moles. This keeps them off my lawn! Easy to use instructions, and you will see results quickly. good luck!"
1378,819,3,"Since I received this via the Amazon VINE program, it has either been in the high 80's / low 90's or raining daily.  As such I have not been able to give it a functional test (and probably won't until the Fall).  However, since Amazon VINE issues a review deadline, I will comment strictly on the appearance and construction. From an appearance standpoint, the fire pit is fairly nice from a distance.  Up close , however, you can see the construction/packing/shipping flaws which give it the air of an older beat up pit.  In particular, the bowl has a major &#34;bend&#34; in the upper flat lip.  I've considered that this is by intent to give it a more rustic flair, but since it prevents the spark guard from sitting properly on the top, I doubt it.  Also about 1/3 around the top, also on the flat lip is a &#34;ding&#34; which looks like someone gave it a mighty whack with a ball peen hammer.  The material seems to be stronger than plain old copper so I have not been able to fix either imperfection by hand.  Finally, the cover supplied is rather flimsy and I don't think it will last long in our Chicago weather.  All in all, I would have to say that had I paid ~$300 for this I would have returned it as defective.  As it is, as the weather normalizes and evenings cool a bit, I'm sure we'll get some use out of the pit."
1578,237,2,"cut the worms in pieces, crushed the runs and waited for repair, baited each hole.  Waited days and checked, worm gone in some, but no dead moles, and burrows continue to appear.  I have tried traps, poison peanuts, more traps, more traps, more traps.  These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year.  One came up and died on it's own last fall perhaps from &#34;old age&#34;.  Nothing seems to kill these critters, as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade."
1323,610,5,this is a great relaxing camp chair. well made and very durable.  I do enjoy the material for ventelation on a hot day as I perspire profussely.
652,239,5,"The basic design of the mousetrap has not changed in over 100 years, but there have been some minor improvements. They are less likely to catch your finger instead of the mouse. One thing I especially like about these is the trigger, it is larger than most. So the mouse is more likely to set off the trap. The plastic actually smells like cheese, so you can put it out without bait ans still catch a mouse. Personally, I use peanut butter with a touch of bird seed to bait my traps. And from past use of Tomcat mousetraps, I can tell you they still work when you go months between mice and have fewer to none false alarms of the trap just failing."
1105,891,5,These covers are made of a very high quality of material.  I have seen and used ones in the past that barely made it one year (Pennsylvania) These ones are impressive and I have high hopes they will last a while and with a 4 yr guarantee I doubt I will be disappointed.I also liked the straps that wrapped around the legs of the chairs so that the covers do not blow off.
318,87,5,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small, outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good, I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally, I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
342,118,4,"Yes, it's just a piece of foam with a hole in it, but it's light, it's tough, and it makes working on your knees much easier. I suppose you could recycle an old foam camping mattress into several kneepads,, but if you don't already have one to recycle, this works just fine."
559,867,2,"This is not my first experience with Terro, but it is certainly my least favorable. I was looking forward to blasting some Argentine ants outside that like to crawl along the side wall, where they eventually are able to climb right into our orange tree from leaves that brush against the wall. This was not so successful.Setup is easy. The blue spray nozzle conveniently packs into the container's handle for storage, and to set it up all you have to do is remove the lid of the cap and insert the hose of the spray nozzle into it. The hose is actually coiled inside the sprayer and it can be extended a good 1.5-2 feet, which is pretty convenient so that you can hold it away from you as you're spraying. The nozzle turns so that you can spray in a narrow stream or a wider fan-like spray.So anyway, I went out to the ant line and began spraying, a mixture of the narrow stream and wide spray along the whole wall. Now most liquid ant sprays will essentially kill on contact, and that's what this promises to do. You spray it and you see the ants start shaking violently and then within seconds they're dead. And any ants that come after them avoid the area completely or die within 15-30 seconds of walking onto it. When I sprayed the ants with this, that didn't happen. They just kept moving and walked out of it. And not only did they not die, but the fact that I had just sprayed the area seemingly didn't mean anything to the rest of the ants behind them, as the ants just kept walking right through the wet areas. Now, I found that if I sprayed enough to essentially DROWN the ants, then they would (eventually) die (I had one that I thought was dead and then several minutes later I found it trying to walk away still), but according to the instructions I should only be spraying enough to lightly moisten the area. And even still, even with me spraying a liberal amount of the insecticide, ants just walked right through it afterward with seemingly no effect. They weren't discouraged, and they didn't bother trying to walk around it or turn the other way. This, in my mind, failed the first test of a store-bought insect killer, the ability to easily kill and deter ants.I will keep trying, but for now this failed miserably at handling a single ant line."
1306,839,5,"This omelet spatula actually works as intended; it slipped easily under the eggs and flipped them in half without the omelet ripping.  Unfortunately I'm not sure it's good for anything other than this task.  It's not designed to flip pancakes for example.  I would highly recommend this omelet flipper and it would be a great gift for the ""hard to buy for"" foodie person."
165,495,3,"This is a nice looking grill with easy to replace grill parts, but it did not last very long. The side burner went from working normally to becoming a big ball of red flame after only a dozen uses. It rusts easily and the ignite button quit working after about 2 years. I would only recommend this grill if you only grill sparingly and have a safe place to put it up when it is not being used."
870,577,3,"These are easy to set up and use. No live catches yet, so I cannot attest to how well they work. I think this would be a much better product if it was reusable. This will not be cost effective. Why not just use a sticky pad and then wrap the carcass in a plastic bag? It would be a lot cheaper and still non-toxic/safe."
66,936,5,"The back of the bag has instructions for growing a cutting which is helpful.Our plant wasn't a cutting, but it's still doing well in the soil.Soil quality looks good, you know, for dirt.The composition of the fertilizer listed on the back is:Nitrogen .03Phosphate .03Soluble Potash .03There's more than enough potting mix to get several cuttings or plants planted."

1275,238,5,"Recently I had the horror of facing a large roof rat IN my house, something new for me.I did NOT enjoy it and after taking a few lame suggestions from people that have never lived with this thrill, an experienced friend suggested one of these Tomcat Wooden Rat Traps.I bought it and the suggestion brought results quickly....Bye Bye Roof Rat!!!It Does The Job!"
1377,647,3,"Please do not get me wrong I purchased two of these hoses site unseen, from a product review on a local gardening show. It does the job, but they were not what I had expected. It was described as not your general pocket hose, but I mistakenly thought it was similar just a better design and quality. The picture online is a bit deceiving it looks small, but is large. It is a high quality, full size hose, but I could have gotten something similar at my local hardware or box store. The material the hose is made of is not rigid but supple and it does not kink, but it is heavy and does take a bit of time winding it up because I have to manipulate it a bit to wind the way I want it to go."
849,82,5,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated, and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn, so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
1447,33,5,"What's in the box?Just the trapWarning:  you need to check with local laws and ordinances with respect to trapping specific animals.  My locale allows year round trapping and disposal.  Bear in mind, some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you're trying to catch, you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap.  I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.  Worked like a charm.Highly recommend."
42,917,3,"Many others have articulated how the iOS (only) app is deficient, so I'll not retread those conversations, but I want to focus on features that some may assume are present, even if not explicitly referred to in the description.a) Wireless. This does not mean wifi. In other words, if you have  a garden and want to monitor plants while you are away so you can check on them via the internet, it's not going to work. You need to be within around 30 feet with your iPhone to connect with the sensorb) soil ph. Yes, it has temp, sun, fertilizer and moisture, but PH is really important as well to planting, especially in gardens that don't use potted soil, so this would be a welcome addition to the device.It seems that if you want to use this in the house, it's great and gives you several points of data at once, but I don't know if it's all that convenient given that you could get most of the measurements with other much less expensive instruments."
875,334,2,"I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter. The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless, leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work. It seems simple enough. Fill the reservoir with water, connect the hose, and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it isn't that simple. The water doesn't seem to flow on its own. I have tried several things, from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to ""prime"" the tubing with water, but nothing seems to work. I did read that there is a way to get it to work, but I had already given up at that point. It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant, that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I can't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work, and so apparently it isn't totally worthless. But for wasting my time, and frustrating me, I will give it 2 stars. I should also mention this thing is ugly and won't clip on to pots that have a thick rim, like some ceramic pots. It is also made of very cheap plastic, not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products. Overall, this thing is not good and I do not recommend it."
1326,208,5,"Our backyard is a bald-patched embarrassment. I have tried several times (unsuccessfully) to reseed, overseed--pretty much everything short of actually having the whole thing ripped out and rototilled (if it were my lawn, and not my landlady's, I would). Because the dirt is so hard-packed and resists absorbing water, I got it in my head that aeration was the key. (My neighbor the gardener has a big machine, but I wanted to do this myself. I'm frugal like that.) I looked at several models and types at the local home stores, and finally decided to order this one. (In the interim, I ordered and tried theClean Air Distributing FLA1K20 Lawn Aerating Shoes. Let's call that an assistive device. I like the concept, at least.)As soon as the Yard Butler arrived we went out back and started poking holes in the ground. (Following the advice of other reviewers, I was careful about how I put pressure on the handle. In the harder areas, I found that a gentle back-and-forth or circular wiggle aided full insertion.) I was amazed at how incredibly dry the expelled plugs were. The Yard Butler and I covered the whole yard sparingly and then watered judiciously. The next day the task was easier and the plugs were somewhat moist. The next day it was even easier. I also used it in the flower beds to increase drainage around my trees and shrubs.Before I put it away, I knocked out the dirt, filed down the cutting edges and sprayed some lubricant on the tines. Once I've achieved a nice, tight pattern across the whole yard, I'll fill the holes with sand and overseed again with Bermuda. (Every other grass type dies off and Bermuda just keeps coming back, so why fight it? I did plant someWhite Dutch Cloverto add nitrogen, attract bees, and say, ""Take that, Bermuda!"")So far, I am very happy with this aerator. If one day I have a decent-looking lawn, I'll be even happier with it. And I will thank the Yard Butler by giving him his freedom."
741,113,5,Forget those spikes that bend or break when you shove them into hard ground this is the ticket and even if the sprinkler head should fail its easy to take off and replace .

803,145,5,"As a Christmas gift to a friend, I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds, not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice, gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!"
72,842,5,"I like house plants. I have maybe 30 or so at this time. Probably half of the plants I have are Christmas cactus (schlumberga russelliana mostly)and while they are pretty foliage wise through out the entire year, the shorter days towards November and December cause them to flower, thereby giving these plants the common name of Christmas cactus.and they will come back every year, provided you keep them  in natural sunlight until the buds set on them. (No indirect light at night, it will mess up the blooming time.)Christmas cacti are fairly fragile when you repot them or move them, Sometimes there are loose segments that you can grow into a new plant. A good Christmas present is easy to make from the loose segments and the Take Root Rooting Hormone.Now you don't absolutely _need_ the Take Root Rooting Hormone.  You can put the little segments in a cup of water and they will take a few weeks to root providing they don't rot.  You could stick them in dirt and they will probably root if they don't dry out. Either of these strategies will take quite a few weeks to see it the segments actually do root.If you take a segment of a Christmas cactus and put the tiniest bit of the Take Root rooting hormone on the open stem and place it in dirt (and keep the dirt just a little damp), the segment will root much quicker and grow stronger than if you just use the water or dirt method. You can cut segments, dust them with the rooting hormone and quickly have a thriving pot of Christmas cacti, If you want to make sure you have tem ready for a Christmas gift, you must root them at least 6 months prior to December to ensure bloom, This  time will allow the plants to become well established.Of course, you can use the rooting hormone for any plant you want to.  I use it when transplanting plants into the garden. It helps the new plants to be established quickly.I recommend Taking Root Rooting Hormone highly to any one who has house plants or outside plants. It gives you the opportunity to increase your plants quickly at a minimum cost. And as any gardener knows, that is terrific,_enjoy_"

You can tell by the high quality of the products that these are going to last for a long time to come! No flimsy cheap equipment but tools that you know will be every barbecue season!If you plan on grilling, you need to get their product line. You won't be getting cheap tools that need to be replaced soon. These are going to last you for many years and they price them so reasonably! Enjoy your new Barbecue Spatula - I know you will love it as much as I do!"
184,826,2,"Many Americans have a grill, though far fewer have a smoker.  It makes sense most of the time, but there are times where a smoker is the way to go.  What's one to do if they don't want the expense, hassle, and space commitment of a smoker?  Well leverage their grill.I've tried various smoker boxes (spoiler alert: they work better than this btw) as well as a few improvisations, and I had high hopes for this.  It had its own sealed (kinda) box, a place for wood chips, and the promise of simplicity.  Well simplicity is a double edged sword, as it lacks any kind of thermometer (no biggie, as many are lacking anyway), limited space (a bit more of a challenge), a lousy grill (well that's a bigger problem), and lastly no real handle for the lid (how did that happen?).  All in all it's not too practical or safe.  It's sad, as it has promise.  Build a bigger box, give it a handle, and a better grill, and well it may work.Please look elsewhere, you'll be better served."

1574,933,5,"Hummingbirds are some of my favorite tweets and as a consequence I've acquired a number of Perky-Pet feeders. One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.  You might want to do the same too.Happy feeding."
1455,369,5,Purchased these to replace the enamel flavorizer bars that came with my Weber.  They fit perfectly and will provide years more of service.  It's like having a new grill!  For anyone that isn't sure of the fit of specific Weber parts simply go to:  [...] and select Order A Part in the lower right side of the page.  There is a guided search process to identify your grill and what parts fit.  Then you can come back to Amazon to order for the best price.
456,66,3,"We haven't had a bit of problems with squirrels, chipmunks or other pesky thieves stealing birdseed since I put the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be Gone IV feeder out. At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce."
739,40,5,I purchased this to use with the Rain Bird sprinkler. It does the job well. One thing that I had to learn was the base holds water which has rust in it. When you disconnect this from the hose be sure that you empty the ring base and don't soak yourself with rusty water.
485,835,3,"Our neighborhood has some active moles in it and last year they really started tearing up everyone&#8217;s yards. They were very busy under the sandset patio I just built last year, and I had to pull up a number of pavers to shore them up with more paving sand and level the patio again because of the damage they did. Walking through the lawn is a little like walking through a minefield. OK, you won&#8217;t blow up, but stepping in a mole hole or one of their trenches is a good way to twist your ankle or fall.None of my neighbors or I have found a good solution to rid ourselves of the moles. We&#8217;ve tried all sorts of gadgets, with little or no effect. I tried the Ortho 490010 Ready to Spray Mole-B-Gon Mole and Vole Repellent out of desperation, hoping it might work.Having now used it, I can&#8217;t tell whether it had any effect. I sprayed a small area on the side of the house where they had been active, and didn&#8217;t notice any new activity within that area or near it. I sprayed a little more a few days later and still didn&#8217;t notice any change. Those two small areas used up the entire bottle of Mole-B-Gon. I fear it would get somewhat expensive to go over the whole lawn with it.Before I made a decision to purchase more of it and keep trying, one of my neighbors told me that one of the neighborhood cats has been catching moles lately. Now I don&#8217;t know if the Scotts formula just wasn&#8217;t effective or if the moles in my yard had already been caught by the cat.I can&#8217;t really give this formula 5 stars &#8211; even if I knew it had been effective, I might only give it one star due to how much you would need to spend on this solution to cover your whole yard and once you are done, there is really no guarantee they won&#8217;t return.Applying it was easy, though. You simply attach it to your garden hose and turn it on. Unfortunately, it also has a tendency to get on you when you turn the dispenser on, so I&#8217;d recommend wearing gloves while using it. The packaging recommends not allowing prolonged contact with skin."
1392,524,5,"I have had many different kinds of hummingbird feeders through the years.  Most of them were the kind where you unscrew the glass or plastic bottle and turn it upside down to fill.  The fill hole on them was small, so I had to use a funnel to pour in the sugar and water.  This hummingbird feeder works fine for me.  I like how you can unscrew the top without taking the rest of the feeder apart to fill it.  It's a nice, wide opening, so it's easy to pour in the nectar.  And it's also much easier to clean out the inside of the bottle as well.The push/pull and open/close part is so you can fill it from the top so that the nectar will not pour out through the holes in the bottom.  Once the top is screwed back on, you pull the bottle up to let the nectar flow down and create a vacuum in the bottle (so it all doesn't just pour out through the holes).  It doesn't leak if the bottom halves are screwed tight, and the hummingbirds certainly don't care how it gets filled.Make sure you clean the feeder and change the nectar about once a week in hot weather.  The nectar will ferment, which is not good for the birds."
1391,834,3,"I do like the all-natural approach to Animal B Gone, which isn't all that different from another I've tried.  Yes, it does work, but trying to spread this over a wide area doesn't work as well.  With a small spray bottle such as this one, small areas such as raised flower garden or flower beds are practical, large areas not so much so.Spraying liberally around a small flower garden bed works for me.  You can't use it on any food products and that's where the major limitation lies.  The ""Safe for People, Pets, and Plants"" on the front label is rather deceptive.  A small asterisk doesn't cut it. This is a simple spray bottle and although it will cover 750 square feet, it's not set up so I can use it with a garden hose.  Not all that practical in that regard.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:1.15% Rosemary Oil0.31% Cinnamon Oil1.15% Peppermint Oil1.53% Putrescent Whole Egg SolidsINERT INGREDIENTS:Water, Kaolin, Vinegar, Sodium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate .... 95.86%"
71,711,5,It took a while for the birds to try them but now several chicadees are addicted to them and we have two Carolina Wrens (we are in Finger Lakes region of NY) which we were excited to see. The Titmouses were liking them also. I think they provide good protein for the birds in these very harsh months and will use these next year too.
1502,264,5,"I have an old B&D; G400 Type 3 that finally gave up the ship on the cap, butAce had it in stock at less than $.20 cents more than Amazon, so I bought theAce cap and ordered a back up from Amazon.The caps ARE THICKER than the original, and they are still orange; not black!While you can replace the spool and cap on these, you cannot replace the housing,as it is part of the motor assembly, so you might as well buy a new one.If you do buy a new one, I would look at the GreenWorks 21212 which is a 13"" trimmerthat according to the reviews has actually figured out a way for the auto feed to ACTUALLY WORK.I have ordered one of these and will be reviewing it as soon as I get it in.I like these light weight trimmers over the heavy gas trimmers (I have a HomeLite 2 stroke that I had to fix to run right, and a Honda 4 stroke with brush blades for the heavy stuff), but most ofthe trimming I do, can be done with these light weight electric trimmers, and if they stop working,you spend $40.00 (Not $80.00 to $200.00) for a new one."
885,232,5,This is an excellent narrow shovel. I had never seen a spade of this shape until I had a professional landscaper working on my yard. He had two of these. It makes so much sense to add this spade to my gardening tools.
996,600,5,"I bought two of these deck boxes and these are great.PROS- Very sturdy; my wife and I can both sit on it without any give- All parts are durable plastic -- the deck box should last at least a decade- Pieces fit well together; no significant gaps where parts connect- Will keep items dry regardless of weatherCONS- Average looks; they look like any plastic deck box out there and certainly aren't upscale looking- Doesn't completely shut so bugs can still get in through small openings by the lid- Assembly could be a nightmare. I'm very handy and have all the right tools and it still takes close to an hour to do. However, both my boxes came with one warped side. One of them I needed another person to push hard against it to get it to fit right. The other was in such bad shape that it was impossible to snap the last wall in (which I had to return to replace the wall). If all sides fit, then you really only need a second person at the very end to finish off the lid.OVERALLDespite the assembly issues, I'll probably still buy another one or two soon since they are awesome deck boxes."
550,669,4,"I have to admit to a love for gadgetry. I love checking out all the new gadgets, and trying a few.  One of my favorite mechanical gadgets I've tried recently is the Cuts + More multi-purpose scissors made by Fiskars.Fiskars, the oldest company in Finland having been founded 360 years ago, is the creator of the original orange-handled scissors that has become a household favorite in America. Fiskars, which specializes in hand tools, released the world's first plastic-handled scissors in 1967.Cuts + More attracted my attention because of all the tasks it performs, somewhat like the famed Swiss Knife. The function that really caught my eye is that you can easily take the scissors apart and use one blade as a knife, especially as a box-cutter. That strength, however, is also the products weakness because in my experience the scissors come apart when I don't want it to and then I have to take time to make it one-piece again.The scissors has one notch that allows it to be used as a wire cutter and another notch so it can cut twine. A power notch on one blade can be used to cut light rope. The other blade has a bottle opener, although how often do we use bottle openers anymore? And the same blade has a pointed awl tip.The titanium steel blades are very sharp and cut easily. The Cut + More scissors boost the company's patented ergonomic handles. Another nice feature is that this tool is shipped with its own sheath which contains a blade sharpening tool.After trying out the Cut + More, I was going to put it in my gadget drawer but had second thoughts. This is useful enough to keep it in a handier spot because it's a tool I will be using often."
498,147,4,"After reading the listing and reviews, I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
1263,470,4,"These bags open at the top (carefully) and then there is an inner mesh with holes in it so as you pour or shack the open bag over the area to be treated, the mesh helps you not pour too fast, and it creates a sprinkling effect to disburse the dry granules evenly.  I used some of this on some large ants, earwigs, and other insects that had infected some old wood.  I know that's what insects do, but the area was close to a swing set, the wood was a tall post holding a bird house, and I just didn't want all those nasty things around.  One treatment, and they disappeared.  I also put this around the outside of our house to create a perimeter a few feet wide, but with all the plants and wood chips, I still see earwigs from time to time so this stuff is not perfect."
415,73,4,"I bought this product back in 2004, replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!"
1087,196,4,Last summer I found that the Deer Off II with battery controlled sprayer saved my new rose bush so I was eager to to try this concentrated version. It works just as well but takes more effort to use.  First you have to mix it and the full directions are for a much larger amount than I need at any given time.  The bottle also gives ratios for mixing so you need to figure that out to how much you need and mix it accordingly.I re-used the bottle and battery controlled sprayer and the product worked just as well as it did last summer.  As with the previous Deer Off product you'll need to respray after moderate rainfall I've found and the product can discolor the leaves and flower petals a bit if you put too much on.  That's a challenge because you'll have to experiment to get a feel for how much is too much too keep the critters at bay.
1185,593,2,"Up Date July 19 2011 I have used Cyclone 0.80 Inch line In It and It works great but the line breaks too easy In heavy weeds.

I got most of My lawn done and made It to My small Swimming pool but the Swimming pool has stared to dry rot, I used the Black & Decker Grass Hog 1000 last year but the plastic gear melted before I could get much of anything done.First this weed trimmer or should I say In you Jonesy fluoride-head who are so pathetic that rocky mountain spotted fever and lyme disease and taking that poison cyprofloxin Is Not a problem for you In your case grass trimmer Is Not for you because the motor has a few extra pounds but for You that needs a real weed trimmer and do Not want to drop dead In Oklahoma humidity trying to start a gas powered weed trimmer, I succeeded at mounting metal blades to It also getting It to use 0.130 Inch Cyclone line. Silly Me I did Nor realize that the center screw was hitting the metal shaft throwing off the balance but the cap kept coming off I think drilling a hole In the cap and putting a wire through the eyelets will hold the cap on. Its more powerful than the discontinued Troy Bilt TB50 but Not as powerful as Black & Decker Grasshog 1000 but It does Not have a plastic gear that melts even though the motor bogs down a little bit with the heavy line, I did Not smell the motor getting hot as with the TB50 I do Not think It Is powerful enough to run the aluminium blades without bogging down but will run the plastic blades with the metal edge just fine buy the kit and mount It to the cap make sure Its well In the center or Its like holding a paint shaker It shook so hard It kept coming unplugged and unfortunately there are No marks where to put the screws In or Instructions how to mount the metal blades as there should be. Actually It does better with the 0.065 Inch line than 0.130 line It slows down too much with the heaver line so I want to try Cyclone 0.080 line and see how well It works.

795,10,3,"All products of this type are not effective for mosquito control, so if that's your intent, you must look for an alternative type of apparatus.  Bug zappers like this use UV light; it's been proven time and again that mosquitos have 0% attraction to UV light!  Oh, sure, the octenol attracts SOME types (not all) mosquitos, but the way this device is designed, the octenol cartridge hangs on the BOTTOM of the unit, away from the electric grid.  Mosquitos that are attracted have absolutely no reason to go inside the grid, because once again, they are NOT attracted to UV!All this device will do is kill a bunch of UV-attracted bugs, such as moths and mostly harmless aquatic-type insects that would NEVER have come near your home anyway if you didn't have a bright UV bulb shining in their faces.  Oh sure, by statistical chance, you'll kill a few mosquitos just by chance one flies in there by random but we're talking about less than 5% of the mosquito population will do that.  5% erradication is not going to solve any of your mosquito problems.  Folks, this is all scientific proof, so please don't believe the huff and puff of marketing schemes to make you believe otherwise.  If you need to control moths or non-mosquitos, then this unit might be good for you.  Otherwise, look for something else."

With this window vac I can spray on a bit of windex and vacuum my way to shiny clean. Another plus is that it extends my reach where I can reach the top of my mirrors without a step stool. (elbow grease is still required for stuck on particles of any kind)Now for the cons: First off, it's on the pricey side. Second, it's not for large jobs - If you want to clean all the windows in your house, don't expect to do it all at once because the battery just won't last long enough. And third, if you have tabs on the front of the bathroom mirrors (or elsewhere) you will have to be extra careful to not ruin the rubber squeegee edge of the vacuum."

114,838,1,"At first it looks like a good idea. In practice it ain't so great. Cheap plastic fittings on the ends that leaked from the first time I tried to use it. It's pointless to try to use for watering your yard since it is only at its full length when it has pressure in it. So the only thing its good for is watering while holding it or for washing your car. And that's only for as long as the fittings hold up, which isn't very long. It's definitely not worth the $49.95 they are charging for it. After using it I wouldn't pay $2.00 for one."
778,906,5,"Great hose.  It's thick and supple, and it doesn't kink or pinch.  It has high quality brass fittings that have not leaked at all when I added a brass nozzle on the end.

The label says it is drinking water quality.The first day, it seemed like it kept wanting to roll back up, which might be handy if you have it on a hose spool.  I don't though, so it worried me a bit, but then after it was out in the sun all day for a couple of days, that stopped and it's behaving nicely like I want it to now.  I used this hose to lay straight to my greenhouse because I will use it there more than once a day.It's really nice to have a good quality hose.  It's one of those things that is easy to skimp on when you garden, but if you do, you will end up not enjoying gardening as much, and you'll find you'll have to keep buying cheap water hoses that will not work when you want them to, causing you to lose valuable time working running back and forth troubleshooting your hose.  That's why, IMO, it is worth it to just buy a good hose.Even with heavy use, and occasionally getting ran over by a car, a good hose like this should last a long time.  We have one other like this that is on it's 3rd year."

I ended up catching 5 mice with the snap traps and none with the Nooski, all using the same bait. We may have also had a misfire once, we're not sure if it was a mouse or something we did.One positive about the Nooski is that it is supposed to be safe for your pets. That's one thing that concerns me with the snap traps and I have to make sure I put them only in places the pets can't get to.I wish this would have worked but we just didn't have any luck with it. The snap traps remain the most effective for us."
51,524,2,"I really WANTED to like this hummingbird feeder -- it is very cute, with vivid colors and an attractive design, and would (visually) be a welcome addition to anyone's backyard.However, I am finding it very difficult to IMPOSSIBLE to keep from leaking.  First of all, the one I received came with NO instructions!  But I looked the instructions up that the company provided online,Then I made the correct sugar/water mixture (you don't need to buy any ""hummingbird nectar"" mix - just Google ""how to make Hummingbird nectar"" and you'll find the simple recipe: 1/4 CUP SUGAR MIXED WITH 1 CUP WATER.  (Do NOT use honey.) The mix just contained added food coloring to make it pink.My mother and I thought we had it correctly set it up according to the (slightly confusing) directions, and it seemed fine.  Then a few hours later, we looked outside, and it only had a inch of liquid left!  This was not because of a huge convention of hungry hummingbirds...it had leaked all over the ground below.With some adjusting and readjusting, we did manage to get it to hold in the liquid once -- but every other time it leaked out nearly all of the nectar within a few hours.  (We can't figure out what we did ""right"" that one time, either!)Summary:PROS:- Cute design- My dog really, REALLY enjoyed lapping up the leaked sugar water from the deck below the feeder!- We did get it to hold the liquid in ONCE (but cannot figure out what we did right that time!)CONS:- LEAKS LIKE CRAZY!- Missing instructions- Confusing instructions obtained from the company- Cheap, almost ""brittle"" plastic for the clear container (the red parts are a bit nicer)-- I think it would break easily.- My dog is now a sugar addict from drinking the leaks.  ;-)I would not recommend this item for ANYONE to buy!  This feeder is either poorly designed, or there's no quality control at the factory (which is why some people seem to have gotten one that worked well.)Steer clear of this and go for a feeder with higher reviews!"

It's two all-brass pieces, one screwed into the other, with two small O-ring gaskets inside (that look like they're easily repaired).It sprays anything from a fine mist to a forceful stream, so it's good for anything from filling containers to watering new (and delicate) grass and plants.The only downside to an all-brass design is that the nozzle get get awfully cold if you're using it in a colder climate in early spring/late fall. I usually wear some gardening gloves so my hands don't freeze!"
1492,553,5,My roses get some type of bug every year. So I am proactive this year and I have sprayed them with this organic 3 in 1 spray. It is good for flowers and trees. I like that is safe around pets and humans. I am counting on it to work and I will have no issues this year. If it doesn't preform I will come back and give you an update. I cannot really tell right now in a month will tell. I like what it claims. So is you see no updates then you will know I was satisfied and had no need to come back and warn you. Trust me I would come back.
879,493,4,"With a three car garage being used as an office/craft room/storage area in my semi-rural area, you can imagine how field mice are overjoyed when they discover it. They have practically built condos in the boxes stored in the rafters.While I'm not crazy about killing them, they are a nuisance and health hazard to my beloved pups.I had purchased Tomcat Spin Traps in the past, and they were not always effective. They would indicate an occupancy when in fact they were empty, leaving you with a sense of being protected when in reality the critters were probably snickering behind your back.These seem to built a bit differently than the previously purchased ones, and don't have as many 'false positives'.Not sure they are as humane as other traps, however."
249,587,5,"I have not actually used this to spread fertilizer or seeds or anything of that nature. I use this to spread salt on my driveway evenly. I use the Safe-Paw Ice Melter and put a pound or so of that into this spreader to salt my 4 car driveway.The first time i used it, I didnt feel enough was coming out so I cranked it way up (16 I believe). I dumped a ton of it real thick onto the driveway during the spreading. Then next time I turned it down to 8 and tried again. It was still a bit much. Now I am using the 5 or 6 setting on it and that seems to give me good coverage.I did notice some of the salt was getting into the open wheels. Not a huge deal for me but I can see why that would be annoying for some people especially if you are seeding.I do like the edge guard alot! It works as intended and keeps me from salting the yard while doing the driveway.I have used this product for the past few months in the snow and it has held up fine. No issues with breaking or not working properly and honestly for the price it really cant be beat. I would absolutely recommend this to someone."
747,387,5,"This is a great product but Weber if you read any of these reviews something like this needs to be constructed of stainless steel for longer life, not aluminized metal.eventually the heat will flake the coating off and let the rust commence. In the mean time I will enjoy this product until that happens. P.S. there are stainless starters out there but the handles aren't built well and renders them dangerous."
1590,80,5,"Have had for 10 months now on same set of batteries and the zap still feels as strong as ever.  If you swat a fly out of the air it will usually just injure it and you will find it bouncing around on the floor.  It's actually pretty easy to trap them under the swatter by just lowering it down over the fly, kills em pretty quickly this way.  You'd think they'd sense it quicker and move but maybe the wire netting allows the air flow through enough that they're not alerted.  Anyway, it's fun to see the little spark when you get them.  We've kept one in the kitchen and going to buy one for the RV now.  Don't let the kids play with this, it's actually a pretty strong zap.  It is fun, however, to play with it yourself and zap the kids!  And zap the friends and the spouse.  Yeah, everyone loves it! ;)Oh yeah, the case is nice too.  We hung it up near the kitchen as a holder for the swatter and it's been there since we've had it with no tears.  Seems a lot cleaner than having a regular fly swatter out."
1229,167,2,"I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence.  Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter.  I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away.  The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain.  It didn't my local animals one bit!  Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat!  Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden.  Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!"
16,30,5,This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.
407,266,5,"I only wish that I had been the one who thought of these things!  I use those daily, it is amazing how much I can grab all at once.  Unconditionally recommended, get these for your fall cleanup!!!  And then thank me for having pushed you into getting them..."
118,819,4,"The instructions that come with the pit make it clear: you can expect the pit to discolor when you use it.  All the photos highlight that new-copper shine, but after one fire, the shine quickly fades, inside and out.  Not a big deal, but if you are spending extra because copper looks so pretty, you might be disappointed.Overall, I really like the pit, and don't mind the discoloration.  The included grate, and the holes in the bottom of the pit, assist with airflow...this will keep your fire burning longer without having to fuss too much with the wood.  I did notice that after just one use, the metal on the grate itself had warped a bit...not a huge surprise, I guess, but I wonder what it will look like at the end of summer.One other thing: I really appreciate the provided tool for removing the lid.  I've never had a fire pit before, and maybe all pits come with such a tool, but without it I would need to keep protective gloves nearby for removing the lid during a fire.In summary: If it's important for you to have copper, this is a fine fire pit, but you may need to do some work to keep it looking as nice as it did when you bought it."
492,724,5,"WHEN MY CLIMBING ROSE WAS ATTACKED BY APHIDS, WE ORDERED LADY BUGS AND HAVE LET THEM LOOSE TWICE SINCE. THEY SAVED THE ROSE, NO DOUBT. ARRIVED QUICKLY AND ALIVE. A GOOD PRICE."
1120,100,5,"The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.In the YardWhen one buys a yard toy he doesn't really need, especially one that costs a hundred dollars, expectations and hopes are high. To this reviewer's relief, Black and Decker's cordless trimmer exceeds all expectations and far surpasses any preconceptions of performance and utility. Without clear directions I did have a bit of difficulty attaching the tool's handle, but after that little chore it was all uphill.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to its brother. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.RecommendationThis tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use."
563,214,5,"This is a great sprayer that is super easy to use and can be adjusted for use in multiple applications. Twist the handle to unlock/unscrew the lid to fill it, then screw it back on. Turn the handle slightly counter clockwise to unlock the pump and I give it about 10 solid pumps. Be sure to push the handle all the way back down and twist again to lock into place. Very important.+ Perfect Size+ Not too heavy+ Easy to Use, Refill, Carry+ Price+ Really Sprays with Impressive Pressure+ Adjustable Spray Stream_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I cannot think of anything I do not like about it and I have had it for over 6 months. It works great and is offered at a great price."
518,92,5,"We set up the porch this weekend (clean, bring up the furniture, put up the screens and shades) and I installed this pot holder on the deck railing with a pot of tourenia. It was quick, simple and the holder seems sturdy enough to give us several seasons of use. I'm considering getting two more as it's a big deck."
1230,387,5,"This thing works exactly as advertised and deserves all the positive reviews it got. I don't know how I lived without this for so long. This starter is simply fantastic and I was pleased from the very first time I used it to start a BBQ.No more lighter fluid, fanning, piling coals into a pyramid, and other nonsense. Just ball up some newspaper and stuff it in the bottom, light, and come back 10 mins later. Your coals will be glowing red.Very nice construction quality and durable build. And not a bad price too. It'll save you money on buying lighter fluid, or quick light charcoals. I prefer natural wood charcoal, so I don't have to add any unnecessary chemicals to my BBQ. This starter is perfect for grillers who don't want to use lighter fluid and stay all natural. Highly recommended."
506,656,5,"This trap got the rat on the very first night! The spring is plenty strong and the trap is easy to set. No chance of banged up fingers, as you set it from the back end. No need to touch the jaw end. Surprisingly the rat was able to run off with the trap around it's head. Found it dead, six feet away, hung up under a fence. So I may try tying a wire and weight to the trap for next time. If he would have gotten under the fence, I would have lost the trap. Second rat in trap also ran off with the trap and stuck at the fence. This trap is very effective at catching rats, but not strong enough to make a quick kill. Not strong enough to break the rats neck or the trap is not big enough and ends up closing on the head, not the neck. Peanut butter was used as bait."
1023,550,3,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the container - it smells like vinegar. If anyone takes the time to search the 'net for home remedies for fruit fly issues, you'll find vinegar and dish soap as key ingredients to stopping them. Seems Terro has decided to market the home remedy to make a few dollars.Having tried the home remedy, I can say that given time, it can and does work. And given this is essentially the home remedy, it can and does work given time.If you're looking for an instant fix, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you're willing to wait 2 weeks, most likely one or two of these (or the home made remedy) will do the trick."
70,874,4,"I gave it 4 stars because I can't yet say if they all sprout or not.  However, the ease of use couldn't be better. What I like the most is that the seed is already at its proper depth inside the cone, because I have the most problem with this with package seeds. Definitely worth a try and really nice for a child's garden."
1223,731,5,"There are two small 'cons,' but they aren't enough to keep me from giving this little gadget five stars.First Con: It is small, but that is only from my standpoint.  I have five boys, so we make the chicken wings in two batches.  It takes some time, and the boys have to eat in shifts, but the taste is worth it, and they don't mind!  I just feed the younger boys first.Second Con: It makes the entire house smell like Smoked Meat!  NOT necessarily a bad thing, but then I find myself waking up a few days later craving Buffalo Wings at 3 Am.See, just two little issues, both not really that big a deal.  The Smoker is easy to use-just pop off the top, put in the woodchips, and some water, and then add your chosen meat to the included racks.  (the directions are very easy to follow)Clean up is a little more time consuming, but I found that soaking the rack, the chip holder and the lid for a little while, makes clean up a snap!  The insert has a non-stick coating, and cleaning that up takes no time at all.Even at this price point-$193-I am considering ordering another one.  We have made wings in this twice, and both times they come out juicy, tender and very tasty!  We also made Chicken breasts in it last night, and again we were very happy with the results.This is definitely worth the investment if you like smoked meat."
655,388,5,"This is a very thick and durable cover. What I like most about it is that the fabric, despite being so thick, allows enough airflow to prevent mold growth."
615,343,5,"I like the design of this tomato cage, simple though it may be. I love that it is versatile and can easily be added to established tomato plants that have already started. It is easy to snap together and install. We did tomato starters this year, but since we've had such a late start in our area our starters have gotten HUGE, so I like the design of this cage, I think it will be easier to use than a regular cage which can't be adjusted.For the price and design, definitely recommended."
1286,504,4,"This is quite an interesting contraption. It's stated that batteries should last up to 120 kills, and the storage tray holds up to ten mice at a time. It should still be checked each day unless you want to run the risk of pulling out a tray full of maggots. The trap is fairly compact in a smart design.Though targeted for indoor use only, I think that's just Victor's way of making sure people don't set it out to get rained on or to be blasted by the sprinklers. It's also to be kept out of barns so as not to raze it by flame and not used anywhere that flammable gasses may linger - good advice to follow. I might cheat and use it outside, though.There are placement considerations to account for when using the Victor Multi-kill. Because the stairways are open like a cutaway section similar to the tunnels of an ant farm, I believe it's important to get the backside flush against a wall so rodents aren't tempted to squeeze through the backside as a shortcut. This isn't easy to do with moldings keeping the trap away from the wall and with cabinets and counters leaving a cavernous recess. Either situation can be countered, such as by using a cardboard wedge for the moldings situation or by using a board to fill in the recess underneath counters, but it's something one does have to improvise, nonetheless.I feel a better design for the battery compartment would have been to have arranged the batteries to put the negative contact springs on the latch side of the door as opposed to the hinge side, because when the door gets closed the springs tend toward wanting to fold over sideways.As far as usability goes, it's as simple as it can be. It's easy to bait and easy to clear out with everything as accessible as it is. If you're a gadget lover, this mousetrap is sure to please. When I hear this thing prepare the charge, it arouses a bit of excitement, akin to that a fisherman gets after casting a lure into the water.Within the first week, I caught three mice in traditional snap traps and only one in the Multi-Kill. I would imagine it depends on where the mice want to go. The green light was flashing and sure enough there was a hit.  I am certainly glad to see that mice do find their way into the Multi-Kill trap. I didn't get to hear the zap, so I'm not sure if it's silent or if I was away at the time.This mousetrap is neat. Although the cost is a factor, it might be justified by the problem you're experiencing with mice (especially if they're never-ending, as might be the case in rural settings), your desire not to mess with setting up traditional traps and your concern for pets' safety - all valid reasons to give the electronic mousetrap a go. I still use the wooden traps because they fit into places this one does not, but I am still quite impressed by the Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mousetrap."
705,872,5,"This has done a great job at preventing water foaming. I use this with other Orb-3 products.I really like and trust the Orb-3 line.  I use both their spa and pool line for my spa, and their pond line for the koi pond.  All of their products are top notch and work great."
1121,189,4,"My landlord's house is between two rental houses, one of which we are in. The land is beautiful sweeping mountain land they have planted with apple trees, grapes, and a variety of flowers and bushes. We have a communal garden plot as well as a communal chicken coop. My landlord loves the deer that come and has planted an area just for them to browse. But their well-worn path into the area goes right through the apple trees and too close to the tempting garden plot.We are under no illusions that the deer will go away, nor would we really want them to. We enjoy sharing the land with all the critters that come here and, rather than trying to eliminate nuisances, we prefer to seek balance in the ecosystem using permaculture principles and simple deterrents that help the critters make choices that just happen to work out better for us as well.What we are experimenting with now with these deer-repellent stakes is diverting the path of the deer so they skirt the apple trees and garden and head, instead, for the browsing area that ought to give them plenty to eat. I have yet to catch the deer in their act so I can't report yet on how effectively the stakes work for our purposes, but the fact that I haven't seen them at all is saying something. When the apple trees start to flower, that's when we'll have a better sense of how well the stakes are working at refocusing the deer. When I have something more to report, I will update this review."
1525,761,4,"I've seen a few 'fast' traps that claim to just be able to bet pushed in the ground and then set.  Most often these do not work at all, or at least not very well.  The one I've had the most success with is an old school steel jaws with a spring and two manual levers to pry it back and set it.  This also requires digging a hole, positioning it just so, getting the safety off, and hoping to get a mole.  This trap removes some of the work, specifically the dangerous part where you have to set a gothic looking torture device, since you only have to set the plunger.You still will have to position it on an active tunnel, maybe put a bucket over it to prevent light from coming through, and a few other things, but at least it makes the trap part easier and safer."
1271,700,2,"I tried it with a Green Ash tree shoots twice and got no roots. I went to YouTube to get techniques but nothing seemed to help. I will try it again with some other plants, but so far no luck with this product."
1262,886,5,This is a very nice grill cover and well made compared to others I've looked at. It's relatively heavy material. It even has a zippered pocket easily accesible at the top. The one thing you may run into is how are grills sized? This is described as a medium but is huge for our apparently little grill. But get the right size and it should be a great cover for years to come.
1285,905,4,"Our yard waste goes into a large plastic container that is collected via a service, but only every two weeks. Therefore, we're always looking to maximize the amount of waste into the bin. We've had a stick with several ends that we've used but found this to be a lot more helpful. It fits very securely on a rake handle - so securely that removing it is a bit difficult! Minus one for the difficulty of opening the package - it took about 5 minutes of cutting with scissors to open it and get it out. If you have limited physical ability (which is one reason you might want to use a stomper), it's too hard to get out of the package. I also wished it was slightly wider. Overall, though, I am happy with this item and would happily recommend it."
797,874,4,"These pods make growing from seed much easier than the real thing. They are also about 20 times more expensive than buying the seeds themselves, so you hope you are getting something from it. I'd give it 3.5 stars for the reason below.I will update in the next few months as the plants grow/die.For now (first month):- About 80% started growing without issue- About 60% made it thus far. (granted it's hard to tell if the slugs are to blame)Pros:- Easy, just put in soil and water. (don't need to take them out of their pods or anything)- comes with plant food (fertilizer)- easy to open- You don't have to worry about planting seeds at appropriate depths, etc.Cons:- $30 dollars for 18 seed pods. (due the math, that's almost 2 dollars per pod, with those 2 dollars you can buy 100+ seeds)- Almost more expensive than buying lettuce/tomato startersThe description claims it's for gardening experts and new ones alike, but I have to disagree, It is easier for new ones, but a gardening expert will be better off with seeds.If you enjoy growing items from scratch, and want a quick starting point, this is probably a good kit.The cost though, makes me more hesitant to give it a solid 4 or 5 stars. I can buy lettuce starts (6 lettuce heads about 3-4 inches tall) from local garden stores for around $4 dollars. It means, I could get 18 heads of lettuce, that are already healthy and growing, for about half the cost of these 18 pods. Granted a tomato starter and other of the varieties included here are more expensive, but chances of your pod making it into a full grown plant vary, and pretty much never would be 100% rate."
1674,820,2,"All excitement about this fire pit went out the window as soon as I placed the base of the fire pit on the ground. As many other reviewers have mentioned, this fire pit is extremely wobbly and does not rest flush against the ground, which drove me absolutely crazy as I tried figuring out whether or not my brick patio was uneven. I even went and grabbed a level to make sure of it, and after getting positive confirmation, I knew with certainty that this fire pit is uneven, which is an absolute shame because the pictures make it look extremely stylish. As for the other parts, you can tell they are of relatively low quality, and nothing at all really seems to fit just right on this fire pit. There are better options out there, especially considering the price, so take a pass on this poorly made offering."
1187,102,3,"It is sooo totally hot, sleek and shiny, I will pour oil over it and... oh, wait, sorry, that's another review I hope to do someday... this review is for a plastic heating mat to get your seeds asproutin earlier and, hey, there seems to be no other brand out there to buy. This sure does make it an easier purchasing decision.The mat is the right size for one of those seed sprouting kits, but beware that some of them are made of amazingly cheap plastic and leak. It is not a good idea to submerge this pad, although it seems to be sealed up and safe for the typical spills.It seems to work in getting the seeds to sprout, in April on the west coast. My only goal is to have tomato plants going earlier this year.Another reviewer mentioned putting an insulating pad underneath and that would make sense, especially on a concrete or metal surface.But, you ask, how can you give a simple device that actually works only three stars? I bought one of these a few years ago at a box store and it failed in only one season. I also think the price could be better. That is one demerit for every displeasure.Now, about that fun review..."
493,438,5,"Ok, Spring is upon us and pretty soon I can start planting flowers.  I found this on a warehouse deal and bought it right away and received it quickly.  This potting tray is huge and will work perfect to set on my patio table to plant flowers yet still keep the work area around me clean.  Plus I like the fact if I am not finished, all I have to do is pick this up, keep it out of the rain or away from the squirrels digging in it, then pull it out the next day and continue."
729,167,4,"Buying this product for the battery powered sprayer alone is worth it.  The sprayer evenly and accurately applies a fine mist of Deer-Off without any leaks or drips.  It can reach a couple of feet further into my plants than using a hand sprayer alone.The product itself is ok.  It is basically cayenne, rosemary and garlic (and other natural herb repellents) suspended in a water resistant base containing egg whites.  This base is what helps keep the herb-mixture stuck on to the plants to do their job.  Does it work? Yes, as well as applying cayenne and peppermint soap would. Does it have better staying power? Yes, but only in light rain and light wind and not in a thunderstorm.  I usually keep my dog away from my vegetable garden because I sprinkle cayenne, white pepper and peppermint soap on the leaves and around the border, so I have not actually tested to see if this is pet-friendly or not.After a few weeks, squirrels and bunnies are still staying away from my garden. The deer are still munching away but that may be because there's a pack of them and a bite of each deer before they each decide to move on is destruction enough.  The neighbourhood skunk that likes to dig around my stone wall has probably stopped coming around because there isn't any new stench.Overall it works as well as my homemade formula, is more convenient (i.e. no mixing and fermenting) and I really love the sprayer.Recommended."
526,292,4,"2-day delivery speed when my local big-box store was all out made this worth it to me. The seed is okay, but not noticeably better than what I usually buy there for less."
1064,754,2,"...in a perfect world, I wouldn't need *any* mouse trap. They could live in their habitat, and me in mine, and we wouldn't have a problem.But the world is not a perfect place, and my house goes through cycles (especially as the fall and winter approach) when the local mice decide that my natural habitat can be shared by them. If they did no damage with chewing (especially chewing stuff I like --like the insulation around the engine in my car!--) and if they were guaranteed disease free, we might be able to compromise. But their chewing is destructive and their droppings are at best icky and worst can carry disease, leaving cohabitation as an unavailable option. In addition to the efforts of an energetic cat, we also turn to traps when the evidence of mice appear.We've tried many mouse trap variants, and approached the Nooski with an open mind. In the end, its faults outweigh its utility:-Price (including consumable ""replacement rings"": The Nooski is expensive (in the domain of mouse traps, anyway), and the kill device is a small rubber ring that snaps off the trap body and onto the mouse's neck. Replacement packs of 10 cost about half as much as the trap. You'll have to do your own math on whether or not this is the right choice for you (it's not for me).-Difficult arming: this is a two-handed job (and if your are mobility limited, especially regarding fingers or thumbs: forget about it). And arming failures send the kill ring flying...sometimes out of sight.-Death throes: The kill ring strangles the mouse, but does not restrain them. They can wander some distance while fighting off the end, and you HOPE they finally expire in a place where you can see them.-And yeah, then you're going to have to pick up the deceased.All traps no doubt introduce pain and suffering on their victims. The question becomes how much, for how long, and what's left for the trap user to deal with afterwards. Because of flaws in each of these areas, the Nooski isn't the trap for me."
1355,229,1,"I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!"
629,761,4,"We've had a problem with knock-out roses suddenly losing their roots lately. One day they're fine, the next day they're wilted. I read somewhere that moles only eat grubs and earthworms, and the voles (those cute little e-wock things with short tails) use the mole burrows to travel in to eat the roots.  Either way, same results.This trap is plastic but very sturdy and easier to set than the metal ones.  Just be sure the trail is active. Stomp a section of the burrow down and wait over-night. If the burrow has popped up again it is being used, so set the trap.  Nature takes it's course."
1609,22,3,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking, you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers, instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders."
128,906,4,"While this hose may seem exorbitant to some people, as a retired landscaper I understand the value of a good hose. The fittings on this are excellent. Well cast and sturdy. The hose itself is well made and will resist abrasion and kinking. Unfortunately it is below freezing here right now, so I can't take this out and test drive it, but I have every confidence that it will be well worth the expense. I have paid upwards of 50 dollars for the good Goodyear rubber hose and not been disappointed. The looks to be of the same quality. If you buy good hose to start with, don't abuse it and don't mow over it, you will be rewarded with years of use and less in the landfill."
587,63,3,"This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a ""tongue"" so that you could pull it along."
1652,315,5,"So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase!After I charged it overnight, it mowed my 1/4 acre lot and big back yard without problem. No fumes, no oil, no gas, relatively little noise and it's SO much easier to plug something in than run to the gas station to fill a container!The push bar also collapses easily when you want it to, so it fits well into a nook in my already crowded two-car garage!I also like the idea that if I throw solar panels on my roof, I'll be able to fuel my mower with completely clean energy so I just may have to in the next couple of years!"
1063,243,5,This is a great bird feeder. The birds are loving it. It's very easy to fill and hang. I'd recommend it to hang in any tree. The cardinals are already eating from it
137,239,5,"We have tried a lot of different mouse traps over the years including the electric kind. I prefer these as they are cheap enough to throw away when let's say a mouse decomposes on it because we didn't check a shed for a month. I like I can see if I caught a mouse from a distance without touching the trap. I like they kill quickly most of the time, I don't want rodents but I don't want to be cruel either.  We recently used the gel bait which worked great, caught a mouse on the gel sitting next to a trap with peanut butter on it. We always get mice in from the cornfield across the street in the fall, prefer to kill them before they breed more."
112,380,5,"I'm pleased with the Weber charcoal baskets.  I've had them for a month or two and used them 4 or 5 times.  They work great for cooking chicken with indirect heat, and they work pretty well for creating a sear zone for direct heat.  They also allow me to use less charcoal when I'm just grilling for two, which is often the case. I recently made a custom charcoal basket using expanded metal in an effort to get a really good sear zone, but the Weber baskets work better.  In hindsight, it looks like my homemade expanded metal basket was a waste of time and money."
357,345,3,"After I've cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros."
285,387,5,"Best charcoal starter I've ever used. The last one lasted for five years in the weather; it holds a generous load of charcoal (or wood), produces ready coals in about twenty minutes. No petroleum! A fine way to recycle newspapers!"
1202,688,4,"There's no way to operate this trimmer without the second battery, which is included in the purchase.  I need two charged batteries to handle a very small but challenging section of the yard.This trimmer is a pleasure to use in terms of effectiveness and ergonomics, compared to many other trimmers.  I believe this trimmer is appropriate for a homeowner, not professional use.  One can waste money on cheap trimmers that don't last or work well, but this one should last several seasons and hopefully even longer."
922,810,5,"I like that this product is a mole and gopher repellent as supposed to a trapping mechanism I reviewed a while back on here (Sweeney's 9015 Deadset Precision Mole Trap).The administration of this is easy --  the concentrate conveniently attaches to your garden hose and lasts up to 3 months.To prevent the bald spots created by the holes and mounds that moles and gophers dig, spray this repellent on up to 10,000 feet of your yard.The manufacturer claims that the ingredients in this formulation won't harm the animals; this repellent works by creating an undesirable environment for moles, voles, and gophers, and will force them to go elsewhere. It safely and effectively saturates their food sources and surrounding areas, making it taste and smell unpleasant, consequently forcing them to relocate from your yard.I have not seen any moles or mole mounds since using this product. I have seen no negative effects to the grass on the yard either."
1150,577,5,"Yes, this works well. The best part is that you don't have to see or smell Mr. Bojangles before you throw him and the trap out. The proof of the hunt is in the kill."
1665,807,5,"First, let me say that I don't use this fan for duct boosting although it was designed as such.I use this fan with a 20' length of plastic flexible duct to give myself some much needed fresh air when working in my shop. I place the fan unit just under the overhead door and run the duct to my workspace, usually in the corner. The airflow is exactly what I needed to keep cool and not blow everything around like a traditional shop fan or orbiting fan.Noise isn't issue because the motor is far way, but I can see where the noise might be an issue if you're up close and personal to the fan. Since the fan housing is thin galvanized metal I'm sure a bit of duct tape will quiet things down quite a bit.The 5' cord is more than adequate, but you can also add a proper extention cord if needed.For my needs this is a decent fan and works well. The plugged cord adds a mobile aspect as well."
384,469,5,"It is still early for planting in the ground, but when my granddaughter was here I wanted to have her help start my garden. We used theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand had a lot of fun starting the seeds. However the pellets in the greenhouse are wonderful for starting the seeds, but my plants are quickly outgrowing it,, and the planting date is still four weeks away!Voila peat pots. I purchased two sizes of these and filled them withJiffy 5605 Seed Starting Mix - 4 Quart Bag. I buried the pellets with the seedlings in the soil, then watered from the top and the bottom till the peat pots were fully moist. It actually took a couple of days for the moisture from the bottom to be fully absorbed to the top.But all of my seedlings are thriving in this new environment!Since these are available locally, I suggest you check prices to get the best deal."
346,548,3,"I had higher hopes for the Good Ideas EZCJR-BLK 7-Cubic-Foot Compost Wizard Jr. to be honest. It works OK, but I found that 7-cubic feet is really not that large for a household where we try to compost quite a bit, including some yard waste, too. It's easy to add material to it, but not that easy to rotate it once you have any biomass inside. If I had not built a wooden stand to elevate this composter, it would have been more challenging to try to rotate.It turns out I could not replace my old upright composter with this one because if holds far more, so I use them in tandem now. Again, this one is OK, but if I had it to do over again and could have tested this model before buying it, I would have likely not purchased it unless the price was a more reasonable $69 or less. Afterall, it is just molded plastic."
1139,467,5,"One of the things I've always hated about grilling is how long it takes the coals to be ready to grill. These cubes get the party started quicker!The first time I used these cubes with my Weber briquet holders, I used 1 cube per holder full of charcoal, but later discovered that just 1 cube will do the trick for my 18 1/2 Weber kettle as long as the briquet holders are close enough to one another for the fire to jump to the other bin of charcoal.I hate using lighter fluid, especially the smell, and I detected no smell from these cubes burning. The product page says they are even safe to burn indoors. Weber lists them as non-toxic.The small cubes come in a little plastic ""ice cube tray"" with foil covering the cubes. At first, I found it a little tricky to peel back the foil and pop just one cube out, but mastered that pretty quickly.These cubes really made my Memorial Day barbeque a breeze. My friends and I spent the  morning at the beach and were going to have the cookout after returning home. While they were showering, I got the burger patties made, the grill lit and the dogs and burgers cooked. When my friends came back, everything was ready and the table was set--they were amazed!Quicker, cleaner, less smelly grilling...I'm sold!"
85,682,5,I bought this cart when we moved in to our house.  Our yard has a lot of trees and in turn lots of stray branches.  This cart came in handy when picking up the yard.  It was very easy to use and drag around the yard.  It is lightweight and makes the job easier.  I would purchase this item again.
1436,143,5,"These pruners worked great on my rose bushes. I love to bring in fresh flowers and the thorn stripper was perfect. I was able to ensure I did not prick myself at all. The blades are super sharp, and I appreciate the handles being a reasonable size. They were very comfortable to for long use."
281,49,5,"I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install, just 5 min, snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me, my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits, like potato and apples, when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house."
1030,343,2,"Update 07/19/2013: Well, the cage has failed. My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage. The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized. One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed. Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants, but so far, so good. These stakes do have some give to them - I've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there. The side support arms are easy to move around, if needed. This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage, unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season. So far, no complaints!"
914,89,4,I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side.  The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things.  Too small too fast.  These pieces are larger;  most are too large to fit in the smoke box.  I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up.  3/4&#34; to 1&#34; would be a lot better.  However once these catch the flavor is right on.
179,797,5,I had a hard time picking out a new hummingbird feeder as I didn't want the traditional kind. I love antiques and the second I saw this one I knew it would be perfect for my smaller deck outside my art room. Absolutely one of my favorite feeders. Love it.
336,316,5,"My pool can't function without Phos Free ... just a little bit each week keeps the algae at bay!  My pool is very hot (94 degrees in the summer) and even hotter if I run the hot tub; so some sort of algae control is absolutely required.  When I'm using Phos Free, the pool is algae free and clear as a bell!"
1530,601,5,"Not as enthusiastic as some reviewers who say they've weeded their entire neighborhoods, but this works well.  I use it on crab grass in my lawn in addition to dandelions."
1206,428,4,"I could not remember which Q grill we had bought a few months back so when i ordered this it was kind of like a gamble which turned out to be a good gamble that paid off at the end.Quality wise its great, the price was ideal and of course it sits on the grill great too my only -1 star is that although it is clearly shown in the picture that the tire/wheel is supposed to be out i don't like that because the weather still gets to that part so its kind of like what was the point really to just stop there? A few more inches and i would say this was absolutely perfect.Definitely recommend and would buy this again."
738,874,4,"This is a great kit for kids or novice gardeners. It contains a variety of vegetables and herb seed pods and a sample of Miracle-Gro Shake N Feed.  There is a cute little instruction guide that is affixed with a paper measure. It contains the basic information abut the individual pods, including spacing,  whether to plant in ground or containers, whether it should be started indoors, estimated germination and harvest times. There is a recipe for a vinaigrette. I found accessing their website to be a helpful supplement. They have a video on the actual planting as well as additional information including photos of how each plant should appear at different stages of growth. There are specifics for the individual plants and additional recipes.This kit is not going to transform a beginner into a master gardener. The instructions are sparse when it comes to tilling and outdoor ground preparation. Coverage on pests and diseases is minimal at best. The experienced will not need the hand holding and will no doubt be able to select, plant and harvest more economically and efficiently. But it is a fun project for kids and a confidence builder for beginners who long to literally get their hands dirty. Recommended"
1443,837,3,"This is the first and only recharger I have ever owned, so I really have nothing to compare it to. I will just give my initial thoughts on it. I was really excited to get this because I can't tell you the number of times I'm out and need a charge&#8230;ugh! The first thing I noticed is that it takes forever to charge. Okay... not forever, but a few hours and even then I never feel super sure its totally charged. It also only trickles a charge onto my iphone 5S and it cannot completely recharge it, only about 85%. This charger is not what I really need. If I can't find the 45 minutes needed to charge my phone in an outlet I certainly don't have time for this. What I will probablly use it for is when I am camping or hiking and using an outlet is not an option."
1366,780,4,"The CobraCo Beehive hose holder combines a rustic style with a clean modern finish, giving a look that would work well both in a living room and among flower pots.  For outdoor use with a hose, it is plenty big and includes good drainage.  I found the metal a bit thin, and that resulted in it arriving with one side of the base already bent.  However, thick metal with something this big would make it too heavy to easily move around, and with moderate use it should last many years.  I do fear that the steel will begin rusting, and I will update this review if that happens.For indoor use, as the pictures suggest, the central beam can be removed with a screwdriver, leaving the large inner area for storage.  The rustic/modern combo would fit well with both a country look and a more commercial space, such as an office lobby.  It may clash with more minimal or trendy decor.Overall, the Beehive hose holder is a great product indoors and out.  I am struggling to decide which place to keep it long-term.  I want it inside, but then I'll need another way to store my hose!"
1065,526,4,"We love feeding the birds but hate the idea of a gaudy red plastic feeder hanging in the garden.  Yes, the red plastic ones attract the hummingbirds quickly, but they sometimes look a little tacky.  That's why I was excited to see this one: it looks good and doesn't draw attention to itself in a bad way.  Unfortunately, it took the hummingbirds over a week to find it!The antique bottle and metal look very nice.  The base is plastic and holds a significant amount of liquid, but is sturdy and cleans up nicely.  The mouth to the bottle is quite small making filling a bit challenging, but it screws into the plastic base very securely.  The metal hanger on the top is quite small and doesn't leave much space between the hanger and the bottle - in contrast to my previous feeder which had a metal wire and loop.But the hard part was attracting the hummingbirds.  Even hanging it in place of my prior feeder the birds seemed to bypass it.  The only red on it is the small shiny metal ""flowers"" on the feeding ports, but they're rather small.  Also, because the glass is green I had to put a lot of red food coloring into my sugar mix (I try to keep the food coloring minimal) to get it to show up.  Even then, I had to tie a red ribbon on top before I finally saw my first reluctant hummingbird, and it's still not as popular as my prior feeder - which was clear.  I wish I'd got the clear one of this model."
1552,424,5,"I grill year round.  I'm rather analytical by nature and not having a way to way to determine how much propane was left in my gas grill tank drove me batty.  The place where I get my propane fills has a minimum charge, as many do.  After paying the minimum several times because I had propane left in my tank I decided there has to be a better way.  THIS IS IT!Peace of mind is what it provides, especially on long grills like whole chickens, turkeys, or roasts.  You quickly develop an eye for estimating how much time is left on your propane tank based upon the weight shown on the dial and what you intend to cook, how many burners you'll use, at what level of heat output, etc.  Is it absolutely accurate?  No, but it is darn close.  I haven't paid the minimum fill rate since I got the gauge.A friend says ""just buy another tank.""  I did that, but you still end up with the same issue as you near the end of either tank.Another friend says ""just use a bathroom scale.""  Granted, that works too, but this is WAY more convenient than hauling a bathroom scale out to the yard.My Grill Gauge is an essential accessory to my gas grill.  It has easily paid for itself in the dozen or so fills I've had since getting the gauge."
787,943,5,"Having used gas trimmers, and both corded and cordless trimmers over the years, I was very impressed with how lightweight this trimmer is, and the power and battery life it has. With its 2 batteries and tiny toy mower attachment, you could get away without a mower if you have a cute little postage stamp yard.I have Black & Decker's previous cordless electric trimmer, the 18V Grass Hog, and it is, frankly, awful. After a few disappointing uses (it's heavier, weaker, and with a shorter battery life and even longer charging time than this trimmer), it got put aside and we switched back to the gas trimmer (or, more accurately, I quit trimming altogether when my partner's away, as I hate the noise, smell, weight, difficulty starting and intense vibrations of the gas trimmer).I've used this trimmer all over our property, for standard lightweight edging of a maintained lawn, for crisis &#34;mowing&#34; of a severely overgrown (tall grass and heavy weeds) large courtyard, and for trimming paths around water and fences in tallgrass pasture. I've used the little &#34;mower&#34; attatchment on both high and normal grass. It's great on regular grass, workable on overgrown.It's great. Light as-is, easy on your back, hands and shoulders. Doesn't require a kung-fu grip to start or keep on, and with the mower attachment, it weighs nothing and you can operate it with one hand with the same effort you'd need to run an ultralight vacuum.I like that it comes with 2 batteries and uses the same battery as other B&D; tools in the same line (I had another battery from a little cordless chainsaw we got for Christmas). I found all 3 batteries to have the following life:-20 minutes on light edging--what you have around the edges if you mow every week-15 minutes on taller grass and heavy trimming (medium weeds, mid-calf-high grass)-10 minutes on every heavy weed and tough, stemmy pasture grass over the kneesIf you let your big, tough weeds get to your waist (which is true on much of our property, which includes a lot of pasture woods), or you have woody weed and vines, this trimmer is going to have trouble. But then, I don't think any trimmer's going to do well with stems an inch around.The one negative is that the batteries do take a long time to charge--4+ hours each, and there's just one charger. We have a charging station where we keep all our tool and regular  batteries charged and ready to go, so it wasn't a problem for me, but would have been in the days before we had our little dedicated charging area. B&D; does make a fast charger (40 minutes--http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-L2ACF-OPE-Lithium-Charger/dp/B009NOCWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403104470&sr;=8-1&keywords;=black+and+decker+20v+lithium+charger) that I will probably nab in the future.All in all, I was well pleased to have an edger that did a good job, had sufficient battery life for all our normal trimming, and didn't leave my back aching or my hands numb."
316,838,3,"The ""expanding lightweight hose"" is a GREAT idea (anyone who has lugged a big hose around a yard and have it catch on something only to end up playing tug of war with it knows this!), but the problem is that any low-cost, easy-to-manufacture materials that they can use to make a hose like this will ultimately fail.I am an avid gardener, and even though I have gone through numerous ""coil"" hoses (the ones that don't tangle, which is a joke, because the coils ""mesh"" together and/or kink the further you try and stretch it) I am still searching for a miracle hose. I have Spina Bifida, so my balance is off to begin with, and having to tug on a hose ultimately means I have to sit down to do it so I don't fall over. I just want to find a hose I can carry around the garden, that doesn't weigh a thousand pounds, and one whose lengths I don't have to ""babysit"".The expanding hose seems to be a miracle answer, but the problem is that the materials that they use to make it so lightweight and expansive are ultimately easily damaged. So any time it gets caught on anything remotely sharp (corner of a paver, garden stake, sharp corner of patio furniture for example), it gets ""dinged"".I think if they made this from a really durable material it would work, but then it would be super heavy. Or super expensive.Bottom line: if you are just using the hose for VERY lightweight application- say, just picking it up from time to time to hose off the deck or water a pot or two of flowers a few feet from the hose, and the hose doesn't have to go around corners or objects, it should be fine. But if you need to have a hose that can stretch and bend across a variety of surfaces, and really take a little bit of abuse (which a hose SHOULD!), then this expanding hose is not the answer."
1119,285,5,"Can't say how much I love this fire pit.  It's beautiful and durable and comes with a nice fire screen.  The bowl is deep and the copper is quite nice.  It makes a lovely accent piece in any backyard, deck, and/or patio.  The cover is convenient to have in case you're in an area that doesn't allow open fires because it contains it without distracting from the design.  Really nice addition.  Almost gave it away as a gift...glad I didn't."
1204,189,2,"This electronic deer repellent is interesting, but I'm afraid that there's little way to know if it works.  The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device, which sends an electrical shock to the deer.  The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item.  The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees.  I'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard, but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now.  I guess that's good though ... right?  I would say nice try, but maybe a bit off the mark."
1535,666,5,"Great grill. After much research it was this grill that continued to be on the top of my list. After putting it together and lighting it up, i was able to cook up some perfect steaks!"
1605,46,5,"We know that we should not pull beans off the vine if we want the plant to continue bearing.  In the past, we have used small scissors to snip, but often the blades were too short to reach back into the plant and we were knocking off tender young buds.When I saw these snippers, I did not hesitate a moment:  I bought two pair.  (Of course, I didn't want to steal all the fun of harvesting our green beans, so I bought my husband his own pair...)We love Fiskars products--they are sturdy and built to last and blades are good and sharp.  Blades stay sharp for a long time, then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai:  This snipper is too large for bonsai work:  The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper, a bit longer in the handle and the blades, that I find better for using on roses.  Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.  I just mention it so you can be on the lookout.  The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013:  We now have only one pair...I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint.  It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together.  So, it's still a great snipper for very delicate things, but nothing more."
712,901,5,"I was suspicious of this miracle product, but figured it was worth a try. I have one client with three dogs using one patch of lawn for the bathroom. What a mess that lawn is.I applied the lawn patch in the bare spots, made sure the automatic watering system was on, and came back three weeks later to a green lawn in those areas. Couldn't believe how fast and well it worked. Of course, there were new bare spots from the areas the dogs had used in the meantime, but it's great to know that I can fix bare patches with such an easy sprinkle.I'll be recommending to my other clients with dogs."
396,255,5,"I've had a garden for the last couple of years at my current residence without any signs of moles or gophers until this year.  After noticing that a few of my bean stalks were beginning to die I began to investigate.  That's when I found a mole tunnel running around and in my garden near the bean stalks.  I had just received this mole & gopher bait  so I put it to the test.The directions are clear, although very small, and easy to follow.  Use the pointed end to poke a hole in an active trail and put about a tablespoonful of bait, cover and wait for it to work.  Well it's been two weeks now and I haven't found a dead mole or gopher but there are no new trails or dying plants in my garden.  Did the bait work or did the critter leave?  Not sure but I will use this again if I find another mole or gopher making trails through my yard or vegetable garden."
1482,817,5,"I have an armchair that matches this lovely all-weather wicker Ottoman.I switched the cushions.  The chair had a thinner cushion, and the ottoman had a larger cushion, and when I switched the two, it just felt and fit better.This is light, easy to move around, durable, and works indoor as furniture, or out of doors.  The cushion is not attached, and so it swings off the wicker ottoman easily, but that is OK, as my feet hold it in place.  This is strong enough for my kid to sit on this as a chair, when a larger group of people are squeezing onto the porch.As a 240 pound man, I like that these wicker pieces stand up to my weight, don't feel like they are about to break, and are attractive in a clean way.  Good buy."
1235,31,4,"First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again."
383,454,4,"While this killing soap works well, I believe pesticide works better, I actually prefer the faster more guaranteed methods of killing bugs."
125,751,5,"I'm so happy every time I see these for vine as I love them. They are some of the sturdiest and long lasting and easy to use traps that I've ever had. So easy to use, even an 8 year old child could use them without help. The stainless steel they are constructed of is a high grade and I've yet to have one rust, not even the ones that got a hole shot in them. The double doors gives your prey the sense they are not walking into a trap because they can see straight through to the other side. If you're real lucky, and I've had it happen once, you can catch two at once but they have to be entering the trap from each side at the same time and be far enough in when one trips the door to catch them both. Spend the extra money for this brand, you'll be glad you did. They never disappoint."

1456,875,4,"Good Grill Brush.  Quality construction with a long handle so you don't burn yourself while cleaning the grill.  Docked a star for price, I have found similar brushes at big box stores for  half the price.  Needed a new brush, can't beat the convenience of Amazon."
1526,906,5,"This garden hose is everything the promo promises.  I have had it two weeks, and it is still winter here, so had to wait for a spring day to give it a test.  First, notice it is 5/8 inch instead of the 1/2 that one might grab to save a few bucks. There is nothing skimpy about any feature:  the fittings slide right onto the spigot, and the black rubber/silicone grip at the ends just makes the hose easy to control, besides relieving possible stress at the joint. It does coil nicely, and is not too heavy for its size.  I do expect it will last a lifetime."
271,938,5,"The Perky-Pet Elegant Copper Glass Hummingbird Feeder is a nice compromise between human and bird esthetics.  It is, as described, elegant and looks artsy hanging.from a branch or shepherd's hook.  The birds should enjoy the brightly colored feeding blossoms.Here's hoping.As I've found with all the Perky-Pet hummingbird feeders, this one is very easy to take apart for filling and cleaning, and there's a sturdy hanging lanyard.  The Perky-Pet people know their stuff."
343,345,5,"This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended."
273,802,5,I have been wanting a cultivator for a while so when I seen this one from Fiskars for the great price I snapped it up.  I am so glad I did because it is so easy to use and it works so nicely to cultivate between my garden plants to remove the weeds.  My husband tried and it and he liked the fact that you can adjust the length on it as well.  It cleans up well and it has a nice large metal hook on the handle for easy storing in the garage.
1296,527,5,"What we have here is a very pretty, and surprisingly large, glass hummingbird feeder.The bottle looks every bit the antique part with bas relief designs on it and the metal loop on top is securely fastened for easy hanging. The base is a metal/plastic combination and on it are the metallic faux feed-port blooms which really look awesome. The whole base comes apart with a few twists for easy cleaning and refilling.Very happy with the form and function of the Perky-Pet 8109-2 (not the best name though guys!) and I look forward to having many new hummingbird friends enjoy a sweet drink or two from it during the summer."
905,310,5,"I've used this stuff for years.  You have to be patient with it, as unnerving as it can be to watch the little critters march across your floors/counters.  How long it takes all depends on the size of the colony I assume.  The problem at my previous residence took almost 2 weeks to clear up (They seriously slowed down after the first few days).  The ants at my current one took &#60;3 days.  I don't use the &#34;spots&#34; they provide.  I use a larger piece of cardboard and put individual drops all over it.  You want the most &#34;edge&#34; area for the ants to feed from, so one big pool doesn't work.  Check your spots often to make sure they don't eat it all and wander off to find alternate food...make sure you keep it like a buffet, always full!  Although you don't want anyone to ingest it, as far as poisons go....I feel fairly comfortable having it around."
632,779,4,"This is an attractive container if you want to hide your garden hose. The actual color of the container is a medium green with black streaks (a fake aged look but it looks nice) with a lattice pattern. It's much nicer looking (and a lighter color) than the photo that appears in the Amazon description. The container itself, at a little over 9 pounds, seems lightweight - it's easy to pick up and move, but it's not so lightweight that it falls over. It feels sturdy.It easily holds a garden hose. I had no problem coiling a garden hose into the container - the center post makes it easy to put the hose into the container.The container also has several holes - there is one large hole (approximately 2 inches in diameter) along one side toward the bottom from which you can slide the garden hose and then attach to the faucet (you can see this hole in the Amazon photo). However, I'm not sure why you would want to do that - that seems to defeat the purpose of hiding your hose. There are several small holes to drain water (and also helpful if you want to use the container as a pot for a plant).If you want to use it for other purposes, the center post is easy to remove. I can see using it as a container for magazines or even dog toys.Note that this review (and rating) is for the container only. I also received the lid for this hose holder. The lid looks like the lid of a trash barrel - a top with a lip. Unlike a trash container, this lip should fit on the inside of the holder. Unfortunately it's just a bit off - the lip fits on the inside of 3/4 of the container but not for the entire container. For the price of this container (and lid), this lid should fit perfectly."
186,561,4,"First I bought the McCulloch MCS2001 14 amp Electric Chipper/Shredder.  It worked ok on sticks and twigs, but feeding leaves in was a time consuming chore.  We wanted something where you could scoop up a big handful of leaves and just drop them into the mulcher.  The Worx model does that.  Essentially it is a weed-eater and uses the same plastic line to cut up the leaves.We use the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket (also purchased on Amazon) to catch the leaves.  We spread ours out for mulching, so we don't use a plastic bag for curbside disposal. As long as the leaves are dry, this unit works quite well.  The McCulloch unit was very heavy and hard to maneuver and store.  The Worx unit breaks down nicely for easy storage and is easy to move around.  I would buy the Worx again.String Option: We needed new mulcher string and I noticed the Worx uses .090 string.  You can buy specific Worx replacement string online for more than I prefer to pay.  Most trimmer string is smaller or larger so I purchased the .095 string and it fits, snugly, for about 1/3 of the price.  You have to cut it yourself, but that's not a problem."
341,751,4,"The first evening the trap (Havahart 1064 Large 2-Door Easy Set Trap) went off, the bait was gone & no critter was inside.  Thankfully the second evening the trap worked properly & caught a opossum.  Since then it has been working adequately; not perfectly.The new design is very sensitive which means it can be hard to keep the trap set.  It takes very little to set it off.  Sometimes the action of setting the trap sets the trap off!  Like the older model, determined critters sometimes escape.  Many times it would be set off with no critter inside.  If bait is still inside I am guessing the animal is pawing at the cage rather than entering it & setting off the trap.  If it is set with no bait I believe the critter was able to break out.  If you already have the older style, I wouldn't recommend an upgrade but if you need a new trap then this one is likely to give you nearly the same results as the older model.While I recommend this trap I do not recommend the smaller trap www.amazon.com/Havahart-1062-Rabbits-Skunks-Squirrels/dp/B003QP328I/ref=cm_cr-mr-title.  Both (smaller & larger) traps are identical in design from what I can tell yet one works & the other does not.  I have been setting the smaller trap out every single day/night for over two months & it has never, not once, not ever caught anything!  But it has gone off without a critter inside & the bait gone time & time again.  All I'm doing with the smaller trap is feeding the wildlife."
383,653,5,"Hummingbirds love these feeders, they constantly drain the feeders dry, they love to perch and eat all day long, super product."
635,312,5,great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
205,312,5,Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
727,250,5,These work fine.  They are good to splice the tubing or splice/repair the tubing if it gets a hole in it (which mine did twice)I will order more.
103,625,3,"The Sun Joe SB600E Sharper Blade 4.5 Amp String less Electric Grass Trimmer/Edger reviewed here is very Wobbly (It vibrates a lot) and noisy and hard to get used to as you feel tired because of the vibrations using it. It also feels heavier than most String trimmer/edger because of these unwanted vibrations.While it may be conceptually a good idea as it does not need string replacement but it has a major design flaw as the motor is severely underpowered and gets compounded by the semi stiff space age plastic blade whenever it comes in contact with cutting materials like grass or weeds.IMHO, The Plastic blade is not dead center on the motor and it wobbles a lot causing severe vibrations for the person who attempts to use this productI also found that the motor does not have enough power to cut thru' simple grass as even a slight touch on the grass slows the motor down which makes it useless. The Blade may last few months as it does not seem to erode quickly but if you do the math the cost of the blade is still high close to $30 compared to Strings (less than $5) which you can buy and replace easily.Before using this I have used Homelite 13 inch. 4 Amp String Trimmer/Edger which is not sold on Amazon but in local hardware store for less than $30 dollars and had excellent results with it.I still feel that the idea of using ""string blade"" is best as you have virtually unlimited cutting power and you can easily sacrifice the string and keep going at the weeds and grass once you reload them.Sorry! Sun Joe Good Concept, But poor design! - I would not recommend this to anyone!**** Update ****Aug 25, 2011**** ****** ****While most of the points that I had mentioned above are still true, I did give this Edger another try last weekend to clean out some overgrowth and dirt off my backyard. I attempted to re-install the blade again by mounting properly and some of the vibrations were minimized. While it still got under-powered easily if you come close to the intended areas for cleanup, I noticed that by carefully balancing the trimmer and putting it down more slowly and allowing the motor to gain strength I was able to complete my task by some added balancing acts.Having said, I am going to add one star to the original review as it deserves a ""OK"" Status, Simply because the sheer size of the blade, I could clean-up a larger area than possible with a ""string blade"" trimmer/edger.Hope this helps!"

825,229,2,"We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house. Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied. He stayed quite a while, dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me. I'm not at all impressed with this product and don't recommend it."
533,806,4,"Summary: Damaged during shipping, but great customer service comeback.Details:This storage bench is a very sturdy and well engineered product. The parts are all sturdy and high quality, with nice finish and fit. Clear instructions, and a wonderful piece for my garage and all the boots and shoes that we don't want coming into the house. The one negative issue is that the unit came damaged, as apparently a good many of them do according to other reviewers. I have posted some of the damage photos on this product page. It's strange because the part that was damaged was the metal base. It is in the middle of the box the unit comes in (BTW, you have to assemble the bench, which is no big deal at all). The box was totally fine. The internal packing material seemed OK, but the base was dented. I'm no packaging engineer, but apparently someone that works there isn't either. I think they need to pad the base better and somehow keep the heavy laminated bamboo top from crushing it during shipping. Like I said above, the external box looked fine, so I didn't gig the shipper. I think that somehow the internal load shifted and dented the base, even though it is not obvious to me how this happened.One other damaged piece was the top, but since it was minor, and the damage was in a back corner, I didn't bother. If you are more picky, you will want to make sure you go over this carefully upon receipt.The good news is that I called the GGW help number and it was immediately answered by a nice lady in the midwest who was able to help me. She quickly figured out which part I needed and had it shipped out to be received within a week. Of course, I need to figure out how to get rid of a five foot piece of 18 gauge formed sheet steel while paying attention to the environment ...After discussing the scarred top, I decided to just let it go as above because it would have required getting Amazon to ship a whole extra unit. For some reason, they can ship all the parts as repair items other than the top. In any case, it occurred to me that the next set would just as likely be damaged if I ordered the whole thing, so I thought there was less risk in shipping just the one part. It turns out I was right and the individual base that shipped as a replacement was flawless.Conclusion:Nice bench. Works great once all the parts are there. Don't expect the first one to arrive perfectly so give some extra time to make fixes with the cooperation of the wonderful GGW service crew. This means you also need to inpect it immediately upon arrival. Don't let one of these sit around waiting for that spare time to do the assembly - just do it now so you don't blow your parts warranty period, or your Amazon return time. I took off one star for this imperfect shipping. If all had been well out of box, I would give it a five."
191,449,4,"These moth traps by Safer Brand work well at what they do, but they will not completely take care of a moth problem. They are simply one part of a total attack plan.Moths do not eat your clothing, rugs and furniture. Their larvae do. This product does not kill larvae. You will need to vacuum a lot, perhaps use insecticide sprays and wash or freeze any items of clothing with evidence of larvae or larvae damage along with using these traps.These traps are essentially a sticky surface which the adult moth lands on and gets stuck to. They die being stuck there. That's it. By killing adults, they can no longer lay eggs on your clothing and soft furnishings. But you must make sure that you place the included lure (which is a chemical attractant) in the trap or it won't work.That's why I've deducted 1 star for these traps - the directions on the back of the packaging only mention the lure briefly and in small print. The lure itself is in a tiny plastic packet in the bottom of the box and is easily missed. I suspect that lots of people miss the lure completely and are then disappointed that the traps catch no moths.This is the way you use the traps: inside the box you will find 2 paper traps folded into the shape of a triangle. The inside of the triangle is covered in a very thick, sticky glue. You will also find two small packets. Open a packet and drop the tiny, lure-impregnated square through the hole in the bottom of the trap. It will stick to the inside of the trap. Repeat this with the other trap and then place the traps at eye level in the room or closet where you have moths. Adult moths will be attracted to the lure and fly into the trap and become stuck and die.The lure loses its effectiveness over time and Safer Brands recommends replacing them every two months.These traps are safe and have no odor at all. I found a couple of moths in my traps the very next day and more in the days following. I think it's an excellent way to get rid of adult moths."
1276,467,5,I have used starters for years in my wood stoves and could probably have used them to start my natural charcoals in my grill&#8230; but I needed an add-on to get to the free shipping. These are pretty nice and it only takes one to get my small Smokey Joe going strong. Not much you can say about a starter but it seems a lot better than imparting a petroleum flavor into my cooking by using a starter fluid&#8230; each to their own. It works so it gets 5-stars.
1546,645,5,This is a really nice large hummingbird feeder so you don't have to fill as often.  I usually have 7 feeders going at one time.  It comes apart quickly and is easy to keep clean with a little brushing.  Has thin rim around so the little hummers can rest their claws while feeding.  Many birds feed at one time.  Even have a family of orioles that like it!  Makes my life easier.

1324,644,5,"We have had live traps for rabbits and garden pests before, but I have always relied on my husband to set them for me. This one is SO easy to set that I can do it myself. With one flip of the lever, both sides were set and ready for catching pests. Now, if I can only get courageous enough to empty the trap on my own, we'll make some progress.The handle on top makes me feel a lot more secure about picking it up with an animal inside. The metal plate protects your hand when carrying the cage, if any animal inside should get agitated. And, the handle is very sturdy, making it easy to get a good enough grip to carry away from the side of your body.The dual sided doors make it convenient for trapping certain animals. Trying to catch a groundhog that has dug a hole in the garden? Position the trap near the hole in the ground, and pile up a few rocks or bricks around it to force the animal to run through the trap when it comes in or out. Now, you can transport it out of the garden and repair (or add)the fence to keep it from returning."
1570,146,1,"I purchased this fuel can because I have a small diesel Kubota Tractor. I needed a five gallon can in order to fill the tractor's tank. The tank on the tractor is conveniently located on the top of the tractor. I have found it pretty much impossible to fill the tractor with diesel from this can without spilling all over myself, and all over the ground, creating both a safety and environmental problem.The ill conceived idea behind this gas can is that the pour spout is rigid and you have to rest a lever on the pour spout on the rim of the gas tank, pushing up on the lever, and then releasing the flow of gas. This does not work at all. You end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand. Remember the can is 5 gallons, and it is too heavy to try and support with one hand. So, for this device to even come close to working, you need at least 3 hands, and preferably four. In frustration, you finally take the pour spout off, and pour directly from the can into the tank, which pours diesel all over yourself.Making the device even more useless, it does not have a vent opening anywhere, so even under ideal circumstances, you can not pour from it.One wonders if they even ever tried to use this thing before they sold it.AVOID ! ! !"
1287,309,4,"I have one tomato plant and I use this mini greenhouse to keep it warm at night. ( I do not use the shelves)It has worked wellThe only issue is this.  During the day it gets too hot.

So if it gets too hot, the vent/fan turns on to remove hot airThe do have these types if venting systems for larger greenhouses so it can be done."

376,777,5,"Perky-Pet 325S Panorama Bird FeederI've got lots of Bird Feeders, but not one like this! *into My Shopping Cart it goes* :)* Aesthetically pleasing -- the antique copper color of the metal seamlessly blends with most any outdoor decor, or natural setting, no matter the Season.  The windows, of the feeder, are made of clear plastic -- one can easily tell, from a distance, the level of the seed (to see if more needs to be added). Feeder is very easy to clean!* Filling the feeder is a breeze:  Press in and hold button on top of lid, and pull upwards -- fill Feeder with favorite seed till top section is completely full -- the bottom section will be full as well.

I fill mine with the (traditional) black oil sunflower seeds -- which seem to please most birds, that eat seeds.  With two separate rungs to stand on, there's plenty of room for lots of birds.  I've counted 8 little song birds, on each rung, all eating at the same time -- some feeding their babies.  Also, a pair of Cardinals have discovered this feeder.*Neighbor-envy...

27,166,2,Birds don't like this feeder and have never used it to feed from despite my moving it to various locations in my attempt to get them to feed from it. Useless!
1676,297,5,"Great fly trap that works as advertised.  It is very stinky, even before taking off the plastic wrap.  I took the plastic wrap while walking out to my backyard and flies were already flying all over it trying to get in.  They were definitely attracted to the smell, even before I had put any water in it.  It is also really easy to set up.  Just take off the plastic wrap, pull up the lid and reposition it so it stays open, then fill with water and hang.  It fills up with flies in just a few days and you have to keep water in it at all times.  Be sure to close lid and toss as soon as it's full or it can get really gross in there very quickly.  The pretty design on the bag is a nice distraction to the gross-ness brewing in there, but it's great to be able to trap and get rid of all those nasty flies.  I think it's a good size too.  If it were larger, it could trap more flies...but then there'd be too much gross-ness to get rid of at the end.  I think it's better to have this smaller size and just have more of them so you can start fresh sooner.  Great product, would recommend."
832,144,4,Construction seems a bit flimsy but it works and I havent had any problems with it.  Its great for clearing snow off cars; especially large SUVs.
374,853,3,"The item itself is well made and finished for the price, and extends easily to its full length. The main caveat is that if you have a window sill narrower that its maximum width, some of the lower plant pots are not really usable, and it doesn't really function well unless fully extended. Liking this planter much depends on your home's decor since it fits more with a classic rustic style look. It's one of those products that either gets re-gifted or is exactly what you need."
505,64,5,"I bought this primarily for natural herbicide free weeding. Having an infant crawling around, I was really hesitant about spraying Roundup and having that leeching into the soil, not to mention, our property borders a creek. I ordered this and had it the next day! Hooked it up and immediately began flame throwing. Thankfully, I began in the middle of our brick patio. This baby kicks out quite a flame. It was a breezy day, I suggest using this when there is little to no wind. It doesn't produce a tight concentrated flame like a propane soldering torch for plumbing would.Honestly I almost canceled the order in lieu of the $28 model from Harbor Freight. Thankfully you can't yet do that on an iPod touch or mobile phone. The more I thought about it, do I really want to trust an inferior tool when I am dealing with 100,000 BTU?Do keep a fire extinguisher or hose on hand! I did this the day after a rainstorm, which I'd suggest. Do NOT do it when it is dry outside. Even so, the grass caught on fire a couple of times.Next task.... I have a carpenter ant hill right where the sand box is supposed to go. No need to pesticides, I'll turn the ground and flame away. Not even summer yet, and I can't wait to try this on the ice in the driveway!"
437,263,5,"I was convinced I needed a strap-on gas blower for my large (over 1 acre) partially wooded yard.  This really does the trick quickly and without much hassle.  I put a few extension cords together and they really aren't that much of a problem.  The blower is much smaller than I would have thought, given the job it does moving large amounts of semi-wet leaves.  I found it very ergonomic.  I wasn't sore after using it and found it not the least bit cumbersome.  It was night and day from my last toro blower.  I havent used the leave vacuum because my lawn is just too big...I really see no cons to this other than I worry about getting fingers into the fan if the bottom grille isn't on. Not sure if there is a safety switch that prevents this.In short, I love this thing!!"
1055,759,4,"I have used many gas trimmers in the past and this one is a good design. I have both the 2510 and model 2520, the only difference is the ability of the 2520 to receive attachments which I highly recommend. I also recommend that you use pre-mix gas/oil from places like Tractor & Supply because the octane is higher and the oil is better quality. Either trimmer works great, and the curved handle makes trimming less stressful on the body."
430,810,2,"I had the chance to try this out and I can't rate the product itself much, all I can rate is the bottle sprayer part because that failed me. I hooked up my garden hose to the bottle as directed and tried using it and it didn't spray as you would have thought. Upon closer inspection it looks like the nozzle part actually has a crack in it which pretty much rendered this useless. I don't know if it came from the company damaged or was damaged in shipping but in my case this was not useful at all due to poor/cheap design of the sprayer which failed."
657,897,3,"It's a nice idea, however I wonder about its longevity.  The birds love it, but then so do the squirrels.  The mesh pretty well limits the type of feed that you can use to black sunflower seeds or peanuts, otherwise you'll have an unholy mess directly underneath the feeder with a short time.Actually, the feeder was easier to fill than I expected, but put it over a tray or bag to catch the offal, otherwise you'll both waste seed and attract other less welcome critters to the fill site.It's an attractive look, but I have seen the early visitors experiencing some difficulties navigating around and within it."

I also use this as a memory bank for odd little bits of information I may find useful, by recording the information in a note, along with several key words I will think of when I want to remember the specifics months later, and taping the note to the Softouch Rake handle. I search for the keywords, and there is the note, displayed to the Softouch Rake handle so I can see it.  But most of the time I can't make heads or tails of what the note meant so I just rake the dirt."
1393,292,5,"Promptly delivered, good clean looking (as well as we could determine, it would be hard to find 'foreign' stuff mixed in a bad of Nyger seed).

839,753,4,"I purchased this product along with sphagnum peat moss in order to lower soil pH for new blueberry bushes I had planted (from 7.5 to 4.5), turning it into the top 10 inches of soil. Several weeks later, my pH now stands at 6.5, and my blueberries appear to be very pleased with the change so far.If you are looking to lower soil pH drastically (as I was), you will want to purchase something with much higher sulfur content. I did so, and the pH is now plunging much faster. This product is a general-purpose soil amendment and fertilizer which *happens* to lower the pH somewhat. That being said, it does contain other trace nutrients that your plants will appreciate."
324,611,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for for my trellis. I was considering using chicken-wire and other fence products like the vinyl deer fences but the openings were always too small. I wanted giant openings so the plants can move around freely.I was a little concerned when I got this. It's a wad of netting in a bag. I thought for sure it was going to be a unusable tangled mess but I was wrong. With some patience I was able to unravel this in no time. The trick is to not pull hard on it. If you get frustrated and start pulling all crazy like, you will end up with a knotted mess.In addition to this netting I also added some plant and flower clips to support the cucumbers and they worked great!"
752,449,4,"I have used this in my large walk in closet. Already, I have caught more clothes moths than I wanted to know I had. I have only had this out for a little while. As many moths as I have caught I will definitely repurchase this product and try to get them all.Make sure that the moths you are trying to get are the ones this product is designed to get. It works beautifully for it's intended purpose."

1255,505,5,I love the 18 v tools.  I'm amazed how powerful they are.  I've gotten a collection of the yard tools as they work so well.  I also have the hedge trimmer on the pole.  Great.
86,788,4,I tried using this as a bird feeder but I have the smartest squirrels on the upper East Coast.  Darn things got right into the food and cleaned it out in one day.  The birds enjoyed what they got of it.  I was watching a Titmouse and Finch and they had no problems getting the food out like some of the other feeders I've had in the past.  This has a nice opening for them to get to and it keeps the rain out.Loading the feeder was a breeze as the top slides up a cable and back down when you are finished filling.  The perches are an excellent size and they are metal like the rest of the framing.  I was hoping their would be glass to view throught but it is plastic painted with a cardinal on it.The weight of the feeder is a nice size so that it doesn't toss around in the wind as easily which I like since I love taking photos of my visitors.  I would have to say though that my best experience with this feeder is that I put some Halloween lights in it after trying it out as a feeder and I really like it better as a hanging light on my front porch.  I will be able to change the lights with the seasons and this is just enough so that you don't have a really bright light but just a little something so you can see where you're going.I have posted to pictures of how the feeder looks with the Halloween lights in it.  It's so much nicer than the photos but at least you can see what I am talking about.  It will be a nice fixture for quite some time for me.

928,81,4,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting."
1522,784,5,"I Love this trimmer it does what i want and gets the job Done!! Yeah its electric and you got to drag a cord around but it cuts evenly and it has a 2yr warranty. I enjoy using it, But I have several hedges I need to remove so I wont be using it that much."
1664,229,3,"I discouraged squirrels from beneath my birdfeeders with a heavy application of this stuff.  It worked until we had rain.  I also spread some in front of my hosta to keep the dogs at a distance, but those two applications, far less than advertised coverage, used the entire container.  I started with a light application, but that had no effect at all, so I sprinkled quite a bit more in the places I wanted protected.  I saw no squirrels where I applied it for over a week, but after it rained they were back.The container handle and pour spout makes spreading the product quite easy.  The material looks about like rough coffee grounds and isn't visible on the ground but would be on a deck or concrete surface.  I didn't find the odor bad at all and could only smell it when I was first applying it.  If it were less expensive, I'd continue to use it for problem areas like around the trash cans and birdfeeders, but as it is the price is a bit high for me, especially when considering the need to reapply after rain (and I presume after watering flowers or shrubbery in the area)."
967,591,4,"&lt;SUMMARY>  In a crowded field the Toro compares well based on it's performance - it cuts and mulches *very* well.  Where it falls short is on features and to a lesser extent, construction.  If I had to do it again, I'd take a closer look at the B&D; CM1936. Both of these mowers were the top picks in the March 2010 Consumer Reports. I would rate this as 4+ stars overall but ding them half a star for customer service.I've had this machine for two months now and was able to test it back to back with our B&D; CMM1000 24V 19"" cordless mower.  To make things fair I sharpened the B&D; and cleaned the deck.  The Toro was substantially quieter and easier to maneuver (It's lighter and the weight is biased towards the rear wheels.  After 12 years the B&D; is still an impressive machine but in tall or wet grass it simply couldn't keep up. I had to re-mow with the B&D; while the Toro gave a good cut with a single pass - even when walking quickly!  You could hear the motor slow down but it still gave an excellent cut and mulched effectively.The improved performance isn't surprising given the extra voltage.  I'd note that when we bought the Black & Decker CMM1000 ~11 years ago, the only other cordless mower was the Neuton 14"" via mail order.  Now there are more than you can shake a stick at (SEE CHART)Fit and finish is good but some items do not inspire confidence.  The plastic motor cover is flimsy though it's hard to judge as two of the plastic bosses were broken (more on that later) Where the charger plugs in wobbles a lot and the locknut holding the circuit breaker in place was half off with no Loctite applied.  This would have been lost within the first hour of use.  Finally, the first time I tried to attach the grass catcher I had to wrestle with a wire which interfered with the grass door.The handle folds but it's the same others - you have a large plastic wingnut you have to turn...and turn...and turn...  Hasn't anyone come up with a better quick release for this?The metal deck makes a big difference - it's deeper and mulches more efficiently, and makes for a smaller overall mower - despite this, our old B&D; CMM1000 feels slightly more solid.  Also, The B&D; had a proper ""Mulch Plug"" while the Toro mulch cover allows grass to collect in a hollow area behind the mulch door - despite this, I never noticed the grass clumping.  The one annoyance is that you have to tilt the mower to dump this out or you are going to be dragging it into your garage.Also the Toro's metal deck allows the blade to get much closer to fences and trees.  With the B&D;, the 2 layer plastic deck was much thicker so the blade was at least 3"" away. This is more like 1"" &lt;UPDATE> It's the wheel placement. If you lay a straight edge across the outside of the wheels, there's 1/2"" to the Toro blade but 1-1/2 inches on the Black and Decker.  Unfortunately the Toro seems to waste this advantage on one side as the handle sticks out so that it rubs if you mow with a fence on your right.Toro says ""Lighter than most other cordless mowers"" but I'm not so sure (SEE CHART)I have mixed feelings about the on/off switch.  I preferred the dead mans bar on the B&D; rather than this lever, which forces you to keep your right hand on the handle at all times.  On the other hand, you can power off when crossing a sidewalk or driveway just by relaxing your grip.Overall, this mower performs well but doesn't of the other features / details right.  For the price, I think the B&DCM1936; offers a lot more, but if flat out mowing performance is your criteria, this is the one for you.I might be biased towards B&D; given our 10+ trouble free years with their CMM1000, but you could say that I might also have a favorable bias towards the Toro since I received it through Amazon Vine.&lt;TORO CUSTOMER SERVICE>I received this item with some minor damage.  There are 4 screws which hold the top plastic cover on.  Two of the screw bosses were broken.  When I removed the cover, I saw that the two zip ties holding the batteries down were also broken.  Finally, one of the rear wheel adjusters was bent.  I called Toro up and after a Looooong time on hold they told me to either pay to have it repaired myself or to go through Amazon and return it.  Not really worth the hassle and rather frustrating.&lt;LIKES>+ 36 volts gives LOTS of power - mulches effortlessly+ 20 inch cutting path (really 19-5/8"", but our 19"" B&D; was only 18-1/2)+ Tall metal deck gives more complete mulching+ Wheel placement BIG plus for cutting next to fences, trees&lt;DISLIKES>- Toro Customer Service- Does not store vertically like the B&D;- Wheels adjust individually- No dead man bar- Grass catcher very small (perhaps 1/2 the volume of the B&D;)- Charger plug wobbles- Bar not as ergonomic, also rubs against fence when mowing alongside.&lt;COMPARO>I've put a quick guide of the most popular models on Amazon.

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient.  They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is almost NO maintenance. (We spent [...] over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.)  Corded electric mowers are a lot cheaper but then you have a cord.  Also, certain models like the B&D; can be stored vertically since there is no oil or gas to leak out>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower?  Up front cost (Typically [...] more)  Also, They weigh significantly more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it.  They don't have as much power as gas (even the 36V ones) and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature for when you let your grass get too long.>>What is a watt-hour?  It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal?  It can be - 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered.  Second, when you consider a ~3"" overlap on each pass, a 20"" blade effectively cuts 13% more than an 18"" (especially since manufacturers generally inflate their blade lengths by about 1/2"")  If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18"">>Why might I want a removable battery?  If you have a large yard, you can swap out for more run time (Note that a second battery typically costs [...]).  Also, You WILL need to replace the batteries eventually, and a this makes it easier (Note that I replaced the CMM1000 batteries by myself, about a 20 minute job requiring only a screwdriver and pliers)  Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>Why should I care about higher voltage?  Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster.  With  the same chemistry and current,  a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic?  Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue.  Plastic does get scratched up, and since it isn't as strong, it makes for a larger mower.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!"

86,874,4,I can't give you that much in the way of review details because I just recently received this and some of the pods are for warmer weather and living in New Hampshire it's a bit late in the season to even try.  I did however plant the lettece outside and they are just coming up and the herbs I have planted in pots on the back porch and am still waiting.  However the herbs do take a bit longer so I will not give up hope as they come from a reliable company.  This is a nice selection of veggies and herbs and it comes with plant fertilizer to help out along with good instructions.  Actually anyone can do this it's so simple.  They were easy as pie to plant and the shell is made biodegradable so it will only add to help fertilize the plants later on as it rots and creates more compost.  Most see items will take the next year so the tomatoes and peppers will have to wait for spring.  Will try and give an update as these grow a bit more so that I can honestly tell you how they have done.
275,140,2,"I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product. The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening. But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit. The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine. I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly. The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them. You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier. And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear. But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area. If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket. Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different. Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money. If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light. Much cheaper in the long run."
1335,388,3,Thought is would be heavier material for the price. Will see how it withstands the seasonal temperature changes. Would rather it not be of a cheap type material as the sun will break it down in a couple of summers in my location.
552,729,4,"I find that when I use a pressure washer to clean something, the results depend more on the PSI of my washer and my patience in using it than any soap I try.  So to really test this Krud Kutter, I decided to use it somewhere I can't access with my pressure washer and see how effective it was WITHOUT that extra oomph.  I have a roof over my patio that has alternating panels of corrugated metal and clear plastic.  I live in the Pacific Northwest so it is under constant assault from the elements plus moss, mildew,  rotting fir needles and a coating of sticky tree pollen every spring. There is no way to get at it with the pressure washer, short of erecting scaffolding.  My husband usually hauls out a giant ladder and hose clamps a brush to a long pole and scrubs it down by hand.  I ran the hose up to an upstairs window (which is at one side of the patio) and used a simple pressure nozzle to rinse off the bulk of the fir needles.  Then I put on a coating of Krud Kutter using a hose end sprayer.  After it sat for 5 minutes, I hosed it off with less than dazzling results.  It was better in the areas where I could get real close with the hose nozzle to get a real strong spray and less so the farther away it got.  Then I gave it a second dose of Krud Kutter applied with a pump sprayer.  I think the combination of a stronger concentration and a second application worked well because a lot more of the built up gunk came off when I rinsed it off this time.  It is by no means shiny and bright white now, but considering it didn't get scrubbed or pressure washed, I was pretty happy with the result.I also treated some vinyl lawn chairs with the left over spray I had mixed and they cleaned up pretty nicely too.Bottom line, when applied as a pre-treatment and then hosed off, it is moderately effective but don't expect that you are going to restore a heavily soiled item to new condition with that alone.  I expect that when combined with the force of a pressure washer and maybe a scrub brush on the really bad areas, this would be quite an effective cleaning solution.  I especially appreciate that it does not contain bleach, so my clothes were not ruined from the soaking I got during the project and that it is not going to harm my plants.  A gallon is similarly priced to 30 Seconds Outdoor Cleaner, but according to label directions will cover a lot more square footage, making it a more cost effective choice.  Give it a try!"
1098,196,4,"Havahart DF32CP-4 Deer Off Repellent Concentrate is an all-natural organic formula that repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.  However, it is ineffective against very determined animals."
1074,477,5,The birds seem to like the product as well as any others I have used.  The crushed corn does tend to draw in some larger birds.  I also like the fact that everything is small enough not to clog up the feeders I use.  Price seems to be comparable to what I have found in big box stores without the trip to the store.
1671,175,2,"Upside-down is the way to go. The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said, squirrels won't touch thistle, but they do like the seed mixes. This feeder is all plastic, including the perches, unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches. The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off. Also, the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch, so there's a good chance of its falling out.In short, if this feeder lasts a couple of months that's about all one can expect. If you want a more durable feeder, pay more for a better built model!"
378,869,5,"I have a grass area in the back yard near the pool where our dog always likes to go to the bathroom.  I tried almost every technique to get her to go somewhere else, and nothing worked.  I tried dog repellants, crate training, and the motion detector sprays that attach to the hose, and none of those tricks worked.  The motion detection sprayers that attach to the hose are useless because they always end up leaking under the hose pressure and I had to stop using them.  FINALLY this Havahart battery powered sprinkler did the trick!  Our dog stays far away from this thing, she uses a different area of the yard as the bathroom.  We can keep it in the back yard as long as we need, without worrying about causing a major flood.  The motion detector is pretty accurate.  The spray is brief, but it's startling also because of the noise it makes, so it will scare people too if you happen to walk in its path and are not suspecting anything!  I love that we can place this in remote locations where the hose connection is not easily accessible, and not worry about the leaking problem of the hose units."
524,564,5,This plant stand is not only sturdy put it is pleasant to look at. I put it outside on our front porch and added one of my wife's potted plants and it looks wonderful. Don't have to worry about it tipping over.
376,560,5,"Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter, BlackI bought Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter, Black about a year ago for recycling the enormous amount of fresh vegetable leftovers and trimmings I was throwing out every day.Did a lot of research, via the Internet, and learned all I could about Worm Composting.  Then, I went shopping... :)I am so glad I chose the Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter! It was a bit daunting looking at all the worm composters that Amazon had for sale.  So many to choose from!  The Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter looked to be about the best composter for My money, especially with all goodies that came with it to get a beginner, like Me, started.  and, I really liked the compact style, and the fact that I could easily move it from one place to another, if I so desired.**  The Worm Factory 360 has a standard 4-Tray size which is expandable up to 8 trays, giving it the largest volume of any home composter.  The trays are very sturdy, easy to stack and clean. I am only using 4 trays.  I keep my composter in the house, and have never had any problems with the trays over heating, caving in, or leaking.  After a year of use, the whole unit still looks brand new.**  The redesigned lid converts to a handy stand for trays while harvesting the compost.  This ""is"" a really great feature, as it allows one to place a filled tray (or trays) in the inverted lid and move them without getting worm compost/drippings all over the place.  The trays fit nicely in the inverted tray, and don't slide around while being carried.**  Included instructional DVD with step-by-step guide for managing your Worm Factory 360.  This is very helpful, especially for a beginner.  I had no problems running the DVD, or comprehending instructions.  Even picked up a few great tips!**  The accessory kit provides basic tools to make managing the Worm Factory 360 easier.  Came with everything I needed to make My very first time at worm composting an enjoyable experience.  I've yet to use the thermometer, though, as my composter is in the house with very controlled temperatures.**  Built in ""worm tea"" collector tray and spigot for easy draining.  This is the best feature, imo!  One can leave the spigot open for air circulation.  The collection tray is large and even has a built in strainer.  Or, one can just turn the spigot off.**  The Worm Factory 360 has a worm ladder that allows any worms that go exploring and drop down into the bottom holder to be able to climb back up into the bottom tray.  Ahhhh! Another nice feature!I bought about 300 red wiggler worms (3 containers) from a local Marina, and since then they have multiplied several times, are very healthy and ravenous. My worms basically live on uncooked vegetable trimmings and scraps, lots of cardboard, recycled paper egg cartons, clean paper, and crushed eggshells (their most favorite).  Picked up an inexpensive littleBIA Cordon Bleu 8-Ounce Mortar and Pestle Set, Whitejust for crushing egg shells for the little ones. :)I don't put fruit, or fruit peels, into the composter simply because it is inside and I don't want to attract a lot of fruit flies.I keep a clean spray bottle, filled with tap water, beside the composter because these littles ones like to be misted every now and again -- and I think it helps to soften the food so they can eat it faster and make lots of compost and ""worm tea"".on an End Note:  My Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter now churns out a full tray of worm castings a month...(that is a lot of natural fertilizer made from stuff I would normally throw out in the trash!).  Gallons of ""worm tea"" a month, that I use on my house plants and outdoor roses -- they have really perked up.  The composter does not have a smell, and my Red Wiggler Worms are very happy. 'nuf said!thinking about buying an additional Worm Factory 360 WF360B Worm Composter!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012"
1071,487,4,"They seem to have quite a few metal parts and definitely feel more solid than plastic sprayers I have bought in the past.  I bought two and have yet to have one break on me in the past six months.  I've dropped them on the ground, on both on dirt and concrete, multiple times."
1329,310,4,"When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my ""kill immediately"" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are ""Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%"", and ""Other Ingredients: 94.6%"".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon."

1385,301,5,These chains are inexpensive. I have so many trees and bushes that I have to buy one of these chains every year but the B&D tool is so handy and easy to use I don't know how I'd get along without it. The chain is easy to install and rejuvenates my pole saw.
262,716,3,"This worked great for my garage.I had left a bag of birdseed and a bag of grass seed in the garage over winter. Even after getting rid of it, the mouse army in my garage had set up a base camp from which to launch incursions into the home proper.These things took down the invasion force in short order.BUT I would only use these in my garage as they are NOT pet resistant. Cedar my cattle dog could have this open in a pair of minutes.If you have a garage and a spring invasion I think this is the ticket.

Ortho has basically the same makeup (the percentages are a little different and if there is a difference Animal Stopper uses mint oil and Ortho uses peppermint oil) and appears to smell about the same.  The prices are comparable.This is a good product and after checking local stores seems easier to purchase.  Animal Stopper seems a more specialized product, but it does say it repels deer and bears which are my main concern."
1295,932,5,I really recommend this hummingbird feeder. It's very well built and was easy to fill. It was also nice that it came with the first nectar to fill it with.
760,788,4,"Thebird feederI bought in 2009 is rusting and looks terrible.  Plus, rainwater collects in the base which sours and ferments the contained bird seed.  While it looked nice out of the box, the old bird feeder was problematic and failed to live up to my expectations.  When I saw the Perky-Pet birds and berries lantern feeder offered, I jumped at a chance for anything better.The Perky-Pet birds and berries lantern feeder, made in China, is largely constructed of powder coated metal in a traditional four-sided lantern style.  Each side includes a transparent scratch resistant plastic panel with a screen printed bird and berries design, and a small U shaped perch.  The center of the base is raised with drain holes at the lower corners which keeps rain exposure to a minimum and allows the seed to move towards the small access openings.  A short metal cable runs through the center of the feeder, allowing the top to stay securely in place.  Adding seed requires pressing a button to release the tension and allow the lid to slide up the cable.  Fill with seed and press the button again to secure the top back into place.While the screen printed design is okay, I would prefer it be less noticeable or not even there.  This is a style preference, and I can see where others would prefer the screen print as is.  However, to me it's a distraction.  Otherwise, the construction and look of this lantern style bird feeder is pleasing.It has rained a couple times since I put the bird feeder out, although we haven't had a downpour or major storm yet.  So far, the contained seed has stayed dry and remained usable.  It appears the design of the Perky-Pet bird feeder protects the contents much better.I've yet to see a squirrel get into the food, nor have I seen a bird eat any either.  The branch I hung the old feeder on has been removed, so the Perky-Pet bird feeder is in a new location. It took awhile for the birds to find the older bird feeder, and I figure it's the same scenario with this one.The Perky-Pet lantern style bird feeder is a huge improvement over the older bird feeder I bought.  Only time will tell if this bird feeder will stand up to the weather.  If you're looking for an attractive bird feeder to feed birds and not squirrels with, then the Perky-Pet birds and berries lantern feeder is worthy of consideration.PROS:Traditional lantern designU shaped perchesHolds up to 5-pounds of seedSure-Lock cap system keeps squirrels outCONS:Screen printed design too much for me"
1274,381,3,Its a little flimsy and prone to break after a little weathering. It does what I intended it to do so I'm happy with it.
431,925,2,"I've tried it 4 times so far and, either I have the thirstiest birds around or it plainly just leaks. The bottom part (that has a built in floater much like a toilet tank) is not stable enough. If I gently press on one side then the water just starts dripping out. My guess is that's what happens when a bird lands on it to drink.I'll probably disassemble it and see if I can find the problem but so far it's not working for me. Also, I wish that the top had a deflector. I hang it under my tree and all sorts of cruft still gets through the sieve at the top and into the water."
880,66,1,"Issues with the feeder:-the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook.  It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options. I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- So after only a few weeks, I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out.  And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1."
178,526,1,"Good looking feeder, but the hummingbirds avoid it and the fluid does not flow well into the feeding tray, so the level there gets very low even when there is fluid in the bottle.  Slow turnover of that fluid then results in bacteria growth inside the feeding tray, which is harmful to the birds.  I would not recommend this feeder.  I've owned many hummingbird feeders and by far the very best ones are the Aspects Hummzinger feeders and those made by Best.  Both are available on Amazon.  They attract hummers very well, and they contain no metals (zinc, copper, brass, lead) that are toxic to hummingbirds."
707,102,5,"I used to germinate seeds in flats on top of my refrigerator, but after moving to a new place where this didn't work anymore, I needed something else. I tried germinating some seeds last year without anything special, and while I still had good luck, some took a while to come up, and I knew I could do better with some gentle bottom heat. That's why I bought this mat (the 9-by-19.5-in. version, in my case) for this year.My germination rates seem to have improved from last year, but I was expecting that. If one of the cheaper options (e.g., warm place or top of fridge) doesn't work for you or you want more control, you may want to try this. Being new to heat mats, I wasn't sure exactly what I needed, so I bought a thermostat, theHydrofarm MTPRTC, just in case. The mat will only raise the temperature about 10-20 degrees above the room, so with my cool apartment, I probably didn't need this (until I discovered the next trick), but I'm glad I bought it anyway. If you're as unfamiliar with it as I was, here's how it works: the thermostat plugs into the wall, then the heat mat plugs into the thermostat. The thermostat has a probe you insert into the soil, and it will turn the outlet on the thermostat (into which the heat mat is plugged) on or off as needed to maintain the temperature you set on the thermostat. So, it's a lot like a timer, but based on temperature instead of time. If you plug the heat mat directly into the wall, it will just stay on all the time, since the mat itself includes no ""regulator"" like this. This isn't inherently bad, but I'd at least monitor the temperature and compare it to what you want if you do this instead.The ""trick"" I learned, which is also mentioned in the instructions: insulating under the mat helps. My thermostat is now able to keep the mat off for longer than before. I used to have the mat set directly on my counter under the assumption that it wouldn't dissipate that much heat, but I think I was wrong. Even after the simple step of setting the mat on top of a folded towel, the soil has had an easier time staying warmer, and I'm saving electricity by not keeping the mat on as much. You may have better luck if you use a sheet of actual insulation, but even a towel underneath showed improvement for me.As a final note, I measured the electricity usage of this with my Kill A Watt meter. As stated, it uses about 17 Watts when on (which is, in fact, any time it's plugged in to a live outlet, since there is no switch on the mat itself). It's also UL listed. In summary, I'm glad I bought this product. It's working well so far. I haven't had it for that long yet so I can't comment on its longevity, but I'll update this review if it dies unexpectedly."
170,150,1,Too heavy and kink. Hard to carry around. Expensive to much for female gardener. I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds.
1024,299,3,"These are good size medium chunks and my husband using them for our smoker.  They worked and the smell was nice.  They seem to be over priced, we found similar wood at a local store and they were much cheaper and seem to do just as good of job.  Great for ease of delivery, but shop around to see what you can find at home first."
900,946,5,"This was easy to set-up, easy to charge, and is lightly enough for me to carry around and get the job down. I had no trouble getting through some sizable weeds, trimming up the edges of my lawn, and guiding it along the fence. Even without instructions, which there are some very light instructions, the assembly was a piece of cake. The batteries work great, and don't make it that much heavier than my electrical one. I would take cordless over the hassle of the cord anyway. Really my only complaint is my electrical one came with two spools of wire, this only came with one. On the other hand, it did come with two batteries which is certainly a better bargain. And while I know some gas powered versions might have, well more power, no cords and no fumes are now high on my list of wants.This would be easy for anyone to use, and it worked well for me."
1547,836,1,"This spray smells like geranium flower. It doesn't stop animals to wonder in my yard. I constantly see squirrels and rabits which I like, but don't like neighbours' dog and other random walking dogs peeing and pooping in this 1 spot in a front loan.So I sprayed like a half bottle in my front loan, especially &#34;the spot&#34;. Took my dog for a walk and first thing he did- run over there and pee. Later that day- neighbour's dog in my yard.This product is useless."
1408,175,5,I sold these for years. I also keep one in my back yard all the time. Recently I could not get them so I checked out amazon and there these were. These seem to be fairly priced so I went for it. Finch Birds prefer these feeders over any other finch feeders because finch like to eat upside down. Plus other birds don't like this feeder.
1152,331,5,"I bought two of these traps, and the first night, I caught a mouse.  I also purchased two other types of traps for comparison, and think I will continue to purchase these when I need to.  I love that you can set these with one hand.  When the mouse is caught, you don't have to see it, just lift up the flap, and push the lever to release the mouse into the garbage.  Then it is really easy to reset.  I am really excited to catch another mouse now!  Sadly it's been two weeks since I caught the first mouse, and I am beginning to think I only had one mouse. I highly doubt that, but I will be grateful if I only have one."
414,701,5,"I have been plagued with ants the past few years. This was a sudden and very upsetting phenomenon that I could not fix.I tried the bay leaves, did not work, I tried the cinnamon idea, that  did not work, I tried several ant baits and traps and deterrents even one from Terro and nothing worked but I would get up each morning ant here they were.I know it must have had to do with the fact I have chickens but I would have assumed they would stay out of the house and out there where the chickens' ""stuff"" was.I finally got the ant situation to settle down some after scrubbing everything but it was not over. If you see one ant they will go to the tell all the others where the good stuff is. I was just waiting.OK, so I review products for Amazon and they offered this product for me to try.  I was a bit hesitant since I do have animals but I got it in hopes it would work and that I could hide it.That is exactly what I did, outside near the sliding door I found a way to put these easy to fix traps where my dog would never got the it and where the chickens dare not come. Putting them on the path of the ants or near the place they seem to get onto the house is the best place to put these.All you have to do is remove the little ""nails"" that come with it, remove the foil cover and find a spot to put these.  I did not need the ""nails"" they are for keeping these in place if you are doing it in dirt. After you remove the foil you must, carefully as not to spill the contents, press the top down and twist it so the liquid is released onto the little well on the bottom.Now this little moat type of trap exposed the liquid so the ants can now march in and take the deadly brew to their hideout and feed it to the rest of the other little pests and they are no longer.So far so good I have not seen one little ant since.Now that the summer is over I felt I should come back and update this product. The box has 6 units and I used just one, I need to see where the little buggers were coming from and you cannot do that if you spread this around.  Wow to my surprise I must have found the right spot because I had not seen even pone ant since I broke open one of these traps.  For the first time in a few years that I have nit been annoyed by ants.  This has become my favorite tool in the war against these little pests.I just hope they do not discontinue them like other companies do.... Great item I recommend the heartily..."
173,902,4,"Some rain barrels are really homely so I'm glad when I find one that's not. I have another one that looks prettier than this one, but even so, this is not bad. I don't really see trying to use the top for a planter unless I use plants that are potted and have a saucer underneath.I haven't needed the &#34;Built-In Overflow Management System&#34; yet and I doubt that I'll use both spigots at the same time. However, having an upper one means I don't have to bend over very far when I just want to fill a watering can, and the lower one is best for watering with a hose (more pressure plus the barrel will furnish water even if only a quarter of the way full).The hardware appears to be well made. If this is your first rain barrel, consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot. Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants. And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures, don't forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches. It's best to drain it and then store it someplace where it's sheltered from extreme cold.The water that comes off your roof and through your gutters is not completely clean but it is good enough for plants. Many homeowners will find this to be a worthwhile investment."
358,853,5,"This is going to be a great big, bunch of fun to have, and I plan on ordering others as gifts.  Many of us use herbs constantly and to have this window starter garden is wonderful.  It looks nice, it is well constructed, and when not being used, it folds to compact size for putting it on a shelf out of sight.  As soon as possible I am going to the local market and buy seeds for my new found toy and food source."
1290,32,4,"I love this grill.  This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap.  The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on.  In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on.  I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method.  The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size.  Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc.  But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched.  If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill."
1605,92,1,"No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail, one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it, it did not hold, would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket, two L-shaped arms, six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)"
1280,59,5,"This Weber is simply the best. Get it going, put in your meat - go to bed and get up the next morning to the best briskets and pork butts you ever had. It is amazing how this charcoal smoker can maintain such constant cooking temps whether it is -20 or + 99 outside."

This did not work in keeping two dogs from pooping around two areas, so sorry, the main goal was not hit.  BUT, the almost daily scent of skunk is GONE. We had some fears of a sneak attack if we let out our dog; one day we realised it: No skunk smell? Hey!  Sold!"
146,789,5,"This is really a gorgeous fire tub.  I've received compliments on it from everyone who has seen it, and the copper glow is striking with or without a fire.  The assembly was very easy, just fastening the legs to the base and the handle to the spark guard, then stacking the parts together: base, tub, grate, screen.The vinyl cover fits well and thoroughly protects the tub and spark guard.  We had torrential rain the day after I placed this outside, and it was perfectly dry when I removed the cover the following day.  The cover also serves to disguise the tub so that a casual passer-by will not observe that it's made of high-value (high-theft-temptation) copper.I look forward to enjoying this fire tub for a long time and if, as predicted by some, it ends up as a planter, it will fill that purpose beautifully, as well."
1396,669,5,"I got these scissors mostly for gardening. They work great. The blades are pretty sharp, so they are perfect for prunning my herbs. The herb plants are fairly delicate, so a sharp blade is a must. These make a perfectly clean cut. I have also used them to open boxes, and they work great for that as well, but I am especially grateful for cutting herbs. Great product!"
932,47,5,"My old, heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood.  This one bounces out until it splits, eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke.  I can also split larger pieces of wood with it."
1666,759,3,"I'm probably in trouble, since I didn't do my Vine review on time, but I had to give this thing more than one chance...which I did...where do I start?First, their idea of ""quick start"" involves priming 10X pumps on the primer bulb ... okay.Then, you crank in ""Start"" (choke) position #1, and pull 4 - 8 times (or until it kicks over once on it's own) ... okay.Then you move to position #2 (half-choke) and pull 3 - 5 times for it to start for real.You then let it idle/rev for 30 - 60 seconds and warm up.I found this to be accurate for the first start.  It was a long start, though the cord is fairly easy to pull those 13 times.Once running, the throttle response was sluggish and the max RPMs were nothing special.  This is likely partially owing to the fact that it's documented as a 40:1 gas/oil mix...which stinks.  The entire modern 2-cycle world is on 50:1 ratio, due the the better oils these days.  Maintaining a separate jug of 2-cycle mix is a hassle, and from what I can see, it buys you a little smoke.  If mosquitos are a problem while you're working, then that might be a good thing.  Otherwise, it just stinks and robs performance.The 25CC engine is toward the bottom of the size range, and I found it to be competent in that category, though throttle response is poor, and overall ""uumph"" is lacking.  I have a 22.1CC Echo that far out-classes this 25CC, so I have examples on both sides of the range when you add in my 31CC Stihl.The balance, or lack thereof, is partly due to the curved shaft, partly due to Remington's attempt to get in the 'featherweight' class.  The light head dances in your left hand and is hard to control, while your right hand supports essentially all the weight and controls the throttle -- standard config, not particularly well-mannered, especially in heavier cutting.  This is more troublesome since the shaft is so short.  I adjusted the handles as much as they would go, and I still stoop to use this machine, and I'm just under 6-feet tall.  I would say, 5'8"" and under might have a more comfortable experience.  For me, stooping over my work, and still being unable to get a smooth cut was demoralizing.  I cut about 5X as much with it during my trial run than I intended b/c I kept thinking I was doing something wrong...but it's just not ready for prime time, IMHO.Boilerplate: no reason to buy this over a Wal-Mart featherlight, the 31CC Ryobi from Home Depot is superior, to say nothing of their straight-shaft model.  If this were, by-far, the cheapest option, AND I only had a few minutes of string-trimming, it would be a valid option.  As it is though, it's a plaything, far outclassed by other offerings by virtually every other manufacturer, saving perhaps the green ""Weedeater"" brand at Wal-Mart.  Remington's entrant into that market is at least a little lighter than the similarly sized one, but even the Wally World ""featherlight"" version is going to do just as well, and cost less...  I digress.  I really wanted to like this little trimmer, but just can't muster any enthusiasm."

517,804,5,"The two main concerns when looking at a pressure washer are, for me, is it powerful and how big of a pain is it to move it around?  I am very impressed with this Champion pressure washer in both regards. It is very powerful and moving it around doesn't take much effort at all with the wheels on it, very easy.  I have had it over a month now and used it on various projects and I'm very satisfied with it.Pros+ High powered+ Uncomplicated assembly and set-up.  The whole process took me about 35 minutes and that was unpacking, making sure things were there, reading over the manual and assembly.+ Excellent manual.  So many tools and products lately are coming with cheap or non-existent manuals (referring you to a website to download it) but this came with a full, quality manual that was illustrated and detailed in instructions. It laid everything out in a very easy-to-understand and follow way, but in case you did run into issues it gives you their contact information and help line numbers.+ Easy mobility with nice wheels and handle.+ Electric start-trigger start feature is fantastic+ Excellent customer service*Cons- So far I'm really happy with this I have no complaints.* Customer service experience: When the pressure washer first arrived, there had been a part damaged in shipping so I called their customer service department and spoke with a man named Fred. My call came in the middle of Hurricane Sandy when they were absolutely swamped with calls for generators. But Fred was extremely calm, polite and helpful and had my problem resolved and part on the way.  Not only that, he followed-up once tracking showed it had arrived to make sure I got and I was good to go.  I'm a contractor and you just don't get that level of service much anymore these days and because of that and my satisfaction with this pressure washer, I'll look to their line of products for future purchases too."

1237,870,4,"My spa has lost its glossy luster due to weather and chemicals, so it has a tendency to develop a bit of a scummy waterline despite careful cleaning and treatment.  I did not expect miracles with this product but I was actually quite satisfied. After a few uses the waterline seemed to be less obvious and when in the hottub it felt a bit less slippery.  For the price, a small amount added each time we use the tub seems to be an economical way to ensure the cleanest hottub possible.  Like I said, no miracles, but there is a tangible difference."
1667,577,3,"I bought this mouse trap because it was advertised to seal the dead mouse inside. I wanted to try it out but when I opened the box I was dismayed to see how small the entry is. It's literally 1 inch X 1 inch. Only baby mice can get in. For that reason, I have not used it yet. I just can't believe large mice can get in. So this review is just to let people know, unless you have a tiny mouse problem, don't think about getting this trap.2 month update: Well, I've actually now used this trap and apparently some mice are that small. I baited it with peanut butter and placed it where I knew mice were and it was sprung the next day. My caveat stands however, that the entry hole is only about 1"" X 1"", just to let you know. But it works."

1197,761,4,"My mom has always had problems with moles in her yard.  Years ago, she tried the typical things -- the little spinning flag things that create vibrations and electronic devices.  Of course, those didn't work.  We have never tried chemical options because of our dogs.  The only time our current dogs are loose in the yard is when we are with them, so the Sweeney's Deadset trap is okay.  (the dogs don't stray far from our sides)  There is NO WAY I would have used this setup with the dogs we had in the past.  It would be extremely easy for a dog or child to get injured (quite severely) if their curiosity took over for even a minute.  Anyhow, setup was not just an easy 2 step procedure.  You want to make sure to read the instructions thoroughly.  There is prep work that goes into placing the ""trap"" successfully.  If you don't mind trial and sometimes error during the initial setup work, then I highly recommend this trap.  You also can't be too squeamish when emptying the trap.  I won't empty it solely for that reason.  I may not be a good daughter because of this, but I tell my mom it's her yard when it's time to empty the trap."

Push in the button on the top, slide open the lid, and it stays (pour in the seed) and then push the button back in to slide the lid back down.It looks nice too -- looks like glass and metal, not plastic and plastic.I received this as a gift.  After a week of use, my spouse said, ""Hey that bird feeder is great -- get another one of those like that!""Strongly recommend. I bought another one on amazon."
1514,809,2,"I'm not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with moles in the yard. It is just a repellent so it's used to repel moles not to kill them or eliminate them. For me, the application process is quite lengthy and time-consuming for just a repellent. You have to apply daily to different areas of the lawn for 4 days in a process of trying to get the moles to move away from your lawn. Each day the process takes watering 20 minutes at a time. I think it an time-consuming process for something that is just an iffy solution from a product that has been discontinued by the manufacturer."

Pretty much everything you need with a real plug and USB for charging your smartphone, a lantern for walking at night as well as the two little lights that are perfect for when you need some steady light and don't want to hold a flashlight. It's charges quite fast in full sun and the lights last for hours. I looked over the instructions briefly, but overall it's fairly intuitive and easy to figure out. I've also used it in my garage which doesn't have power. Was awesome to finally see what's going on it there. I like that it's so easy to move around, which is why I haven't attached the solar panel anywhere permanently like it recommended. All in all, awesome little solar power systel!"

Even after using it a few times the pit still looks nice and is easy to clean up after use. The copper gets a pretty aged look with use and weathering, but it does not take away from the beauty of the pit at all. I like how deep the pit is, it makes for a more substantial fire. The accessories that come with the pit are functional and well made. We have this on a patio surrounded by chairs and we tend to gather around it even when it's not in use. An excellent find!"
1017,876,5,"I was so impressed how easy and quick it was to clean our grill with this grill brush. What used to take us a lot of scrubbing with other grill brushes, this brush made cleaning the grill a flash! It didn't take a lot of pressure either, which really amazed me. Even cleaning it was easy, and the bristles weren't hard and sharp like other grill brushes. I highly recommend this grill brush!I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for this review in any way."

1599,795,4,"I love having the hummingbirds around, and I use the Perky-Pet 30 ounce, bottom filling model (Perky-Pet 209 Our Best 30-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder).  The hummers take about 3 weeks to empty the 2 feeders, then I cook up a new batch of nectar and fill them up again.This model holds only 8 ounces, and although the top-fill feature is convenient, it empties before the other feeders, then stays empty until I fill them all.So it works great as a feeder, but it is awkward having to make a new batch of nectar.  Yes, I could make more and store it in the fridge, but I'm already making over 60 ounces at a time in my pot.However, if you have only one or two hummers visiting, a smaller feeder may be just what the doctor ordered.  Perky-Pet knows their business."

The holes on the top and bottom are on the smaller size too.Due to the small size, it won't hold big amount of wood chips. Be expecting to refill wood chips for long cooking.The cover is a little tight and hard to open and close. I believe the intent is to make sure the cover does not open if you throw it into the charcol. For my big smoker box, I have to carefully lay it down in the grill to keep the cover close.While trying to refill wood chips during cooking, I put the box in water to cool it down first and then open it safely. This extra step does not add too much hassle, as the bucket for soaking wood chips is usually nearby.I wouldn't recommend to put smoker box (any smoker box) right on top of the charcoal, as the wood chips will burn out too fast and don't have sufficient time to smoke the food and you will be busy in refilling wood chips.All in all, a well made nice little smoker box."
1514,810,2,"Tomcat Mole & Gopher Repellent is a spray application that is to be used with your garden hose. The active ingredient is castor oil. Castor oil mixes with water to penetrate the soil. You can use it immediately after seeing the presence of moles or as a preventative treatment.The application is easy to use but I'm not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with moles in the yard. It is just a repellent so it's used to repel moles not to kill them or eliminate them. I think it depends on what type of solution you are looking for. For me, if you repel them, they are just going to move to a new spot in the yard.The bottle will cover an area of 100' x 100' area. It also is necessary to apply again if heavy rainfall falls right after application. It may be necessary to purchase quite a bit of product depending on the size of the area that you are having the mole trouble. I think it an expensive iffy solution from a product that has been discontinued by the manufacturer."
1562,555,5,"Just like the old days, these are solid red brass, not the cheesy far-east yellow brass, and certainly not the &#34;alumabrass&#34; which is soft aluminum with a thin coloring of brass.Expensive, but durability wise-worth it."
489,749,4,"I've never used a string trimmer before.  This one is surprisingly easy to use and made short work of cleaning the weeds out of my ground cover.  Though my arms were sore the next day from toting it around, it was better than a sore back from bending over to pull weeds.  The battery life is decent.  I ran it for probably an hour before it needed recharged.  So nice not to be tethered to a cord.  I remember the old tap-to-feed models and it's great to have self feeding string.  Overall, it suits my purposes for light use just perfectly!"
1308,297,4,"This fly trap is simple to use: open the package, unfold the bag, add water, and hang near flies.The bait is a bit stinky, since flies are attracted to...well...you know. But the flies go in through the slits in the top, get trapped, and eventually drown in the water.It's not messy or sticky like those tape traps. It's kind of big, and the water makes it heavy to hang. You need to have a place in mind to hang this, preferably NOT near where you are spending time. If all you have is an apartment with a balcony, I don't think this is the product for you because 1. of the smell, and 2. because you are actually attracting flies to the area you hang it.Recommended for people with a yard, or around stables/livestock where flies are bad."
720,593,4,"Now my last ""schweaty"" boy is out of the house and stationed in South Korea, I've become a Weed-Whacking Mama! Although in Texas we pump our own gas, the thought of messing with gasoline, oil, spark plugs, gas filters and the other stuff the old weed-eater required was a bigger turnoff than the actual weed-whacking chore. I knew I wanted an electric one DELIVERED to my front door. Hello Amazon Reveiws for input ... I'm so glad someone returned theirs which made it a Warehouse Deal for a few bucks cheaper. Although quieter than most gas powered trimmers, don't fire it up too early in the morning. IT WILL wake the neighbors.At 5'2'' in height I am happy to have the pivoting head and telescoping handle to adjust to a reasonably comfortable position for operation. NOT sure at MAX extension it would be comfortable for someone over 6 foot though. All I really had to do was unbox it, attach the brush guard with ONE screw, plug it in and let it rip. It comes pre-loaded with a spool of string and a spare spool of string too. It did a great great job attacking the TALL native Texas grass that grows on the former farm land this housing development has usurped. Me and my manual grass whip were no match for it!Following the directions supplied, using top-down weed-eating approach, it took two 30 to 40-minute-passes each of two days for me to get through the 12"" inch high, overgrown fenced-in side yard.  The heavy trimmer/edger head (subtract 1 STAR) tired out my weak-left arm like a gym workout and required the rest breaks to continue the task. I think that helped avoid the overheating/melting scenario mentioned by another reviewer. My arm tired out BEFORE the Trimmer could. My dominant right arm did just fine without ANY tiring. This new trimmer will make sure I have no excuses to let the side yard lay fallow.No problems with automatic string feed or using up too much string as mentioned in some reviews. I was disappointed Amazon didn't have the 3 spool refills available for this model. Had I known before the trimmer arrived it actually came with a spare spool of string I would have just ordered generic replacement trimmer string from Amazon so I can ""roll my own"" when the spools run out.  When the AMAZON description NOR the one on the Greenworks website indicated a spare spool was included. I bit the bullet and called Greenworks directly, no indication from Customer Service about included spare spools either. I did get a bit of Greenworks shipping/handling sticker shock ($12.95) when you're used to Amazon Super Saver FREE shipping or Prime shipping. The Spools are $6.95 each ... 1-888-90-WORKS (888.909.6757) Monday - Friday 9am to 5pm EST.  My Spare spools arrived via USPS the next business day after trimmer arrived!  Thus far I'm happy with this trimmer and hope not to need the advertised FOUR YEAR WARRANTY. If things should change I'll be sure to update this review.Since I already have TWO heavy duty out door electric cords I didn't need to purchase one. Going to the Greenworks website BEFORE I purchased the trimmer I downloaded the Instruction Manual in advance to see the types of cords etc needed. It also was to ""hedge my bets"" should my Warehouse Deal bargain arrive WITHOUT a manual."

1329,119,4,"While not as strong as a trowel made of metal, Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp', the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized, quite wide, and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool, and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if not abused, it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."

557,495,5,"This is the one you want! The key to a really good grill is to make sure that all the surface will heat equally and evenly, some grills do not have the flames arranged for this to occur. And some grills simply do not have enough places with flames for the grill to ever be able to have an all over surface temp, in other words you will get hot and cold spots. It is easy to determine if a grill meets the criteria. Simply remove the grill plates ( or in this case, review pictures carefully) and examine how many flame jets there are, if the jets extend close enough to the other jets and outward enough to provide that even, equal heat over the whole surface area. This grill meets the criteria perfectly. This grill is dependable and provides the perfect cooking results time after time. Assembly was no problem, I did have to use the instructions in a couple of places though."
1006,601,5,This tool is amazing what a back saver!  We do not need to use as much Roundup in our yard because of this tool and that makes me very happy as our yard is wildlife and pet friendly.  So easy it is hard to believe. Watch the video as proof of ease and effectiveness.
320,922,4,"This Miracle Gro Shake ' N Feed Rose and Bloom Continuos Release Plant Food is packaged simply for easy dispensing and storage. The main fertilizers, a 9-18-9 mixture, is certainly going to encourage strong and frequent blooming, and perhaps more importantly, good root development.What I think the great value of this product is the micronutrients, particularly sulfur and copper, which are absent many commercial rose foods.And of course, add in that there is nothing to mix, just shake product on the base of the plant, prescribed by the label, and that's it. Nothing to mix, nothing to adjust, and very little fear of the product 'burning' the plant. For the average home gardner, this product provides what it promises and because of its application method, make it easy to use and apply."

1001,709,4,"Poor R2D2.  What did you do to deserve this?I know the economy has been rough and job retraining is the rage, but to take a noble warrior and turn him into a vacuum cleaner?  That seems a bit much.The Dirt-Devil ND40100 is a combination of two homeowner-sized machines designed for light-duty use.  Both work well within their limits, but neither is appropriate for commercial or heavy-duty application.  Most people, though, don't need the larger heavy-duty machines.  The combination is perfect for washing cars, cleaning the backyard deck or getting ground-in dirt off of a concrete driveway or side yard.  I have a much larger Shop-Vac that I use as a dust collector for my Hitachi miter saw...this one is  way too small for that type of application.The pressure washer side of the combo is comparable to other units in the $100-$200 range.  It doesn't put out all that much water...the jet, unobstructed, is only a couple of millimeters across when it exits the hose.  When the tip of the nozzle is twisted, two metal plates impinge on the sides of the jet, turning it from round into a fan shape.  The system also includes a rotary brush for use where a little help is needed to lift dirt off the surface.Last weekend, I used the pressure washer to clean my car.  (We'd been away for three weeks and it was really groaty.)  The water fan lifted all the loose dirt off, but wasn't really powerful enough to remove all the surface dirt or some dried-on bird droppings.  The car was sparkling clean, though, after I switched to the brush and added car wash soap to the mix.I also used the pressure washer to clean lichen and other crud off of our concrete driveway...it was superficially clean, but stuff was growing in the pores.  It took the full power jet to really clean off the surface.  Since the jet only cleaned about a 1/2"" stripe and it would have taken forever to do the whole driveway, I stopped and played a game of tic-tac-toe instead.  I'm going to be in serious trouble when my wife notices it...The vacuum, like the pressure washer, is sized for smaller jobs.  It's perfect for cleaning the inside of the car or smaller household messes.  I'm not sure how well it would work in the kid's room...that's normally a job for a full sized Shop-Vac.  (Actually, I'm kidding.  It would work fine in there.  The hose and tools would allow me to get into corners and under things where the normal vacuum won't go.).  The hose can fit into either the suction or vent connection.  If you can't suck it out of the corner, you can probably  blow it out.  Remember to wear something to protect your eyes any time that you're blowing things around.As I alluded to in the title, the vacuum is shaped like R2D2 (of Star Wars fame).  It rides on a platform on top of the pressure washer.  Like the pressure washer, the vacuum's accessories fit onto the stand for easy storage.All in all, I like this combination.  Having the vacuum ride on the pressure washer makes storage much easier.  It's powerful enough for most homeowners.Recommended!"
143,893,5,"I frequently use loppers in the yard  - my old loppers are also Fiskars but they were much lower quality - maybe a thirty buck pair.  These are in a different league.  I effortlessly sliced through a fairly thick oak limb today and used them to tame some Philodendrons Gone Wild in the front yard.  I then used them to break up some cabbage palm fronds and to slice out a root that was keeping me from digging a fence post hole.There is extra leverage in the long handles.  Couple that leverage with a gearing mechanism and you will no longer have to jar your shoulder trying to cut through a 2"" branch.  I'm very impressed with these although there are two points that I believe need improvement.  First, my loppers don't stay closed - they are fairly loose and want to open when I'm carrying them.  My other cheaper Fiskars loppers are much more tight.  Second, I worry about the longevity of the cork.  Aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to grip...but durable?  Time will tell.  Finally, the price point is a bit steep which means you'll have to really need good loppers if you plan to buy these.Overall, I'm impressed by these and using them is actually a bit of fun.  They're just so effortless compared to cheaper loppers. Get them.  You won't be sorry!"

922,404,1,"This product gives me nightmares. Unlike the mostly successful Rat trap from Tomcat, this trap does not kill the mice but maims them instead. Whereas the rat snap trap would have an occasional rat that would get caught in with a paw instead of the entire body, this trap doesn't actually have enough power to kill the mouse. This means that you will have to do the job yourself if you catch a mouse in the trap. To add to that, the mouse in the trap will be bloody, in pain, and in a lot of shock from possibly being stuck in the trap for hours.This is just not worth it. Stay away!"

793,912,5,I was looking for a good grill to take camping this summer as an upgrade to my old coleman stove and this fits exactly what I wanted. This grill was extremely easy to put together with only a screwdriver. The grill also feels very sturdy and well made. The grates are the heaviest part of this grill and are easy to clean. I have not done much cooking on this yet (it's been below freezing since I received it) but plan on using it often during the summer and updating my review accordingly.
1640,869,5,"This is a well-designed, self-contained, animal repellent sprinkler.  No unsightly and inconvenient hose connection to mess with.  No extension cord to connect or batteries to change. The only requirements are to locate it where there will be plenty of direct sun to keep the solar power supply charged, and to maintain a water supply in the 3.5 gallon reservoir.A lesser issue I had was that I initially located mine in the corner of a fenced area . . . I immediately learned that I had no way to access the Spray Away (to add water or adjust sensitivity) without getting sprayed. Easily fixed, as the unit is totally mobile and being all black, it easily blends in pretty much anywhere you place it.  A little imaginative landscaping will also pretty much hide it.  The reservoir/base is about 18"" in diameter and it stands less than two feet tall.  That wide reservoir/base by the way, with the weight of water in it, makes the unit inherently stable.  It is not going to move under even the most severe wind conditions. The pedestal above the reservoir supports the sprinkler head and contains the battery and electronics.  The four photovoltaic solar power panels are located horizontally on top of the pedestal at the base of the sprinkler head.  The single infra-red motion sensor is on the side of the pedestal near the top, with the control panel on the opposite side.It does come pre-charged and ready for immediate use. Just screw on the sprinkler head to the top (a wrench is provided), add water to the reservoir, and it's ready for service.  The water comes out strong and with a range (adjustable) of up to 25 feet.  The charged power supply will provide only about a dozen activations before depleting.  I've already seen that the unit is sensitive enough to pick up rabbits and even squirrels that come within range. During sunlit conditions, one assumes it will maintain itself during the day.  During night conditions with active animal traffic, it's conceivable that the power supply would deplete.  I imagine this would become less of a problem as the local animal community becomes ""trained"" to stay away.  And I can't help but speculate as to whether familiar animals might also figure how to defeat the Spray Away . . . either by learning that it is exhaustible, or learning how to circumvent the coverage area.  No matter - this clever device works and will keep away the balance of unwanted animals and certainly without harming them.I already have taken a preventative maintenance measure of adding a little (less than an ounce) of chorine bleach to the reservoir to help keep the water supply clean and algae free (the black color prevents sunlight and will help in this).  This device should be brought in during freezing weather to prevent damage from internal ice expansion (no garden or flowers to protect in the winter anyway, right?).Speaking more on winter considerations - there may be situations where an owner doesn't want to bring in their unit when temps are below freezing.  There may be year round pests to control (stray cats, dogs, coyotes) or the owner may have a rather permanent installation (such as I have done) where the reservoir is partially buried in the ground. So for sub-freezing temps, I plan to install RV (recreational vehicle) anti-freeze in the reservoir, and run it though the unit before turning it off for the winter. The RV anti-freeze prevents freezing, is relatively inexpensive (much cheaper than automotive engine anti-freeze, which is also very poisonous to animals, people, and plants), and is non-toxic (designed for use in RV water systems including the ""clean"" water systems). And finally, I'm not sure how well winter sunlight conditions will keep the power supply charged.Havahart's Spray Away Elite II is a well-designed, well-built, and humane animal repellent.  It's not magic and it's not perfect, but it does exactly what it promises to do, within realistic limitations."

692,905,5,"I was looking for ways to make my leaf cleanup easier this year.  I was going to buy an attachment that snaps onto the top of a garbage pail and hooks up to my leaf blower/vac so I can vacuum the leaves directly into bags.  However, I realized how much more work it would be to lug the pail around with me as I vacuum the leaves.This season, I resorted to mowing the leaves and bagging them, using my foot to repeatedly stomp the volume down after each time I emptied the mower bag.  I received this item in time for my last weekend of cleanup.  It made the job so much easier.  It did a great job of compacting the leaves so I didn't have to use my foot.  I&#8217;m looking forward to having an easier time next season thanks to this product.The only complaint I have is with the packaging.  It was in a plastic clamshell that was difficult to open."

When I bake, I am forever hitting the top rack when I am reaching into the oven and always add a new burn now and then - hey - that hurts. I received these and decided the best test would be cookies. I actually was a little tired because we are in the process of getting ready to move, and I bumped that top rack a couple of times and no burns! Excellent product. I was a little nervous the first time reaching for the cookie sheet but it was really nice to not have to grab a pot holder. Had a much better grip on the hot cookie sheet also! Everyone should have these in their kitchen!"
1542,122,5,"I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers, I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow, spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work, I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures."

337,704,1,"Since I wrote my original review, the four CAMCO 50 foot hoses that we bought, all have developed bad kinks,  several of which now leak (because the hose totally broke down). There is no way I can recommend this product and I hope that other customers don't have the severe problems with these CAMCO hoses, that we've had.Original review:  We bought three of these Camco ""premium"" drinking water hoses recently, and they KINK something fierce. Furthermore, since this hose is heavier and firmer, when it kinks, the bend itself doesn't resolve and it tends to kink over and over at the same place or places.  I love the hose otherwise, but the design is either defective or we got a couple of bad Camco hoses!  I can't recommend this hose at all, due to this severe problem!"
1602,880,4,"I get a big kick out of this thing and it hasn't failed on me yet, but it has some obvious limitations.  It is much lighter than a regular hose, so it can't be hung over a barrel and left to run; it is so light the water pressure will twist and flip it up, i.e you can't leave it alone, especially if you try to leave it open while turning off the water; it will shrink out of, say, a bucket...  However it comes with a neat optional cut-off valve that I am very happy to have.  Still, it is a little demanding for a hose.It is obviously made from material far less puncture-resistant than a regular hose; I don't hold that against it.  I would only use this outdoors in emergencies; for indoor use it's light and compacts to a size that will fit in a gallon freezer baggie - very convenient.If this doesn't split on its own, I'd give it high marks for a limited range."
1299,856,5,"UPDATE 7/29/13:  Just a quick note after several months of use.  Amazed at how much run time I get on one battery!  I can do my entire 1/2 acre property which includes a long, very wide concrete driveway, a concrete walkway to front door, front porch, back porch and deck, and swimming pool area (LOTS of concrete there).  I know for a fact I would have had to use at least 3 NiCd batteries to do this on the older model, if that would have even been enough.  I can do all of those areas, and still have prob. 1/4 power left in the battery.  Incredible!  Soooo nice not to have to switch out batteries so often.****I have used corded blowers, gas, and lastly, the older gen version of this B&D; blower, which used NiCd batteries.  In comparison to the older B&D; cordless blower, there are several advantages to this one, but interestingly, max output does not seem to be one of them (this new model DOES seem to push more CFMs (cubic feet/minute) than the older model, but not as much as I expected, personally).  Would be nice if B&D; listed some kind of spec for this on their box or description.I also noticed that the in between model (the previous model to this one, which used Lithium Ion, but only an 18V battery) did not get very good reviews., and I wonder if it was probably due to expectation vs. reality.  This is NOT a replacement for a corded or gas blower, if you ever needed that much power.  The poor reviews might also be a result of people comparing that unit to the other tools it was often sold with as a kit (string trimmer, hedge trimmer), which from my experience, were excellent replacements for their corded or gas counterparts.  The ""sweeper"" has seemingly always been the weakest link in this series.Marketing was smart (or honest, at least) to use the term ""sweeper"" as well, because that is how you have to view these.  For LIGHT debris only, and mostly dry debris at that.  This is not going to blow layers of stuck down wet leaves from an aggregate surface (not well at least).  This is perfect for blowing out a garage, though, or a deck, or a driveway or a pool area.  Maybe better still, a roof, especially given the cordless/weight advantage of this thing.The big pros over the older NiCd model:1. VARIABLE speed control!  Yes!  This is awesome because I like to use this around my pool, and too much power there is a bad thing, as you blow all kinds of nastiness into the water.  Older model had only an on/off switch.2. Battery seems to be 10x better than the old NiCd ones I used (and still use).  This was my biggest complaint with the old model...after wheezing air for a few short minutes, it would begin to very quickly slow down.  Very frustrating.  This one lasts much longer, obviously, with the new lithium ion batteries, but also with the whopping 36V.  Nice. The battery level indicator is a very nice touch too...seems like a small thing, but adds quite a bit to the overall use satisfaction.3. Beefed up the bottom of the hose with a hefty scraper...nice...I definitely use this.  Not a big deal, again, just some more plastic, but also again, a small thing that actually makes this more enjoyable to use.So for light blowing work, I really don't see anything else on the market that can touch this...VERY lightweight, VERY neighbor (noise) friendly, and as long as you keep your expectations about the power in check, you should be very pleased.Highly recommended.  I look forward to replacing my other B&D; cordless tools with this new gen series when they come out with them (I also have the older NiCd model of the extendable pole saw, which is AWESOME, and still going strong today)."
164,951,5,"I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review!  These are outstanding grill tongs, they have great resistance, and hang well on our Big Green Egg.  The handle is comfortable and they truly feel like a luxury item! 100% recommend!"
778,871,5,"We have used this product for several years.  We did have a chlorine based sanitizing system but sometimes after heavy rain we'd get a bit of cloudiness and sometimes smell in the pool because our pool is shaded by a tree and the leaves would fall in.  After getting all the gunk out, this would take care of the cloudiness and smell.It also will get rid of the oil streaks that come after I get in the pool with body oil or sunscreen on.  It's 1 ounce per 20,000 gallons of water.  Our pool is small and one bottle lasts us a long time.  We still use it for this now that we've changed over to a salt sanitizing system.  I can't really comment on if it helps the filters stay clean or not b/c we use a sand filter.  I remember we used to be able to pressure wash our filters and use them again.  Now we use a sand filter that is rather big, and I can't tell any difference in how often it has to be backwashed.It works great if you get a funky smell in the pool though - this is what we always use to remedy that."
945,534,5,"When this arrived, I thought how can a bird get seed from these tiny holes.  When I hung the feeder there almost always 6 or more birds at this feeder.  Finches love it and squirrels hate it.I have four Brome squirrel buster feeder and will never buy a different kind.  I have thistle in two of them and sun flower seed in two.  I have plenty of birds year around.  I highly recommend Brome bird feeder to anyone whether you have squirrel or not."
579,337,3,"I have used a lot of Perky-Pet feeders over the past 20+ years. This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they'd done better on the materials end."
376,851,5,"Perky-Pet Mason Jar Hummingbird FeederI've got lots of Hummingbird Feeders, but not one like this! *into My Shopping Cart it goes* :)* An aesthetically pleasing focal point, the blue/green colored antique Mason Jar style glass nectar container -- with embossed bird detail -- really sparkles in the sunlight -- goes with most any outdoor decor, or natural setting. The glass is thick and easy to keep clean.  I use a simple bottle brush to clean the inside. It's easier to clean than the plastic humming bird feeders I've been using.*  32-Ounce nectar capacity -- that's 4 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar.  Just turn empty feeder upside down, unscrew bottom, fill with nectar, screw bottom back on, flip right side up, hang.  That's it! :)* Filled with nectar, the Perky-Pet Mason Jar Hummingbird Feeder is not all that heavy to carry around, or hang. The weight of the feeder, combined with the liquid nectar, seems to help keep the feeder from swaying back-and-forth, too much, in the wind (like the plastic ones do). A Plus, if ya ask Me. :)* An antique (brushed) silver colored base -- that comes apart - 2 pieces - (for easy cleaning) with 5 realistic (slighty raised) buttery yellow (metal) flower feeding ports add to the overall attractiveness of this particular Hummingbird feeder.  There is an ample little metal foot rail (or, whatever they are called) that circles the entire feeder for the Hummers to stand on (and rest) while eating.* There is no ant moat on this Feeder.*Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet Mason Jar Hummingbird Feeder.  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet Mason Jar Hummingbird Feeder sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Would make a Fantastic Gift!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013"
554,546,5,Must follow directions. Use gloves so moles won't detect human smell. These worms are the only product I have ever used that actually work. I use 1/2 worm in each hole. Works!
13,688,5,"My husband initially described this trimmer as ""a toy,"" but once I started using it, it proved itself as far more than a toy!I used it to trim the area outside the front pasture by the road that had become embarrassingly overgrown (yes, even by rural standards).  Admittedly, the weeds that were >1"" thick couldn't be cut, but those monsters were so big that it was easy to pull them anyway.Because I have multiple tools in the 20V collection, I have several batteries, so battery life is not an issue for me at all.  I'd say that each battery lasted me 20 minutes of steady cutting.  As a side note, Black & Decker's chain saw is by far the most wonderful tool of all!I didn't have all that much use for the blower, but it made sense to get it for just a few dollars more.  It is good for blowing sand off of the porch and walkway and works just fine.Some have commented that it's edging functionality is poor, but I don't use it for that and thus have no input.I would definitely recommend this trimmer to others.Update: After 4 months of using this trimmer, I would rate it 5+ stars if I could.  It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.  There were some areas in the horse pasture that had to be hand trimmed because of trees, fences, rocks, or other obstructions, and this little trimmer got the job done.Replacing the string spool is a 2-minute process and super easy. No maintenance, no nasty gas smell!"
333,418,5,"I just set up and ran my Masterbuilt 30 inch electric smoker, and after doing the same bit of fun with a Brinkmann charcoal unit as well as a Masterbuilt GS30 propane unit, I give this unit a heartfelt top of the heap rating.  I'll simply summarize what others have said relative to construction:  it is truly thoughtful, using double wall insulated construction all the way around; whereas many users place oven rope around their propane units, this smoker has a rim of rubberized sealing from the factory; the drip pan is full sized and smartly cantered to drain efficiently; the digital programming is a snap, although I would suggest placing the starting temp adjustment at 200 degrees rather than 100, thus leaving only a modest + or - for a setting; but above all the very useful, very clever loading tray permits really easy addition of chips whilst in use.  I've also mentioned my truly responsive experience with Masterbuilt's customer service, and this is 2012, hence current, so criticism relative to their bottom line is not something I've encountered.  Again, this has been a fun experience."
403,601,5,"got it, used it for about an hour and love it.... it's super lightweight but very strong.... probably works best in moist ground but even in semi-moist soil it works pretty well.... some dandelion roots come completely out and some don't, kind of depends on whether you get it perfectly centered or not. I was able to get dandelion tap roots 12&#34; long out with one tip of the tool. Some broke off like dandelion roots always seem to do but quite a few came completely out. It's not a perfect tool but it's about as close as it gets for weeds with tap roots. I was able to pull out a mallow root that was almost 18&#34; long without it breaking the tap root.... I can tell it's going to last because it's well built & simple to use. Saw some complaints about no instructions but what's to instruct- step on the tool and bend it back, pulling the weed and root out of the ground, nothing could be simpler...... I gave it a five because it worked as advertised and was under $30 total from Amazon..... great product"
1264,715,2,"I was hoping this was just a trap,  instead it is a bait station loaded with a toxic green wafer as 'food'.  I do not recommend,  there's been more than a few family pets lost due to eating poisoned mice,  unfortunately."
1366,260,5,"I have had good success with peanut butter or almonds, but I rarely have either on hand.  This gel is shelf stable and very convenient.  It doesn't make a mess and sticks to the trap, so it is easy to load.  The color is dark green, which makes it easy to see if the trap still has bait.  I can't say that it works better than peanut butter, but I prefer using it."
746,525,5,"I've been using Havahart traps occasionally for 25 years, to relocate wildlife from my barns. The early ones I borrowed caught raccoons quite handily but oooooh that male raccoon was a danger even caged. I had to insert a broom handle through the carrying bale to transport the critter to vehicle (where even caged in the back seat of an old VW, he chewed up the upholstery enough that I made the discovery that the seat was stuffed with straw - note to self: put down boards first next time). So this model addresses that particular hazard of having to pick up the trap, with a protective plate. I might still use an extra device if I were to catch anything as snarly as that guy, but basically Havahart has made the right design change. So far this trap has worked for me in a completely satisfactory manner.I hope you realize the earlier experience I relate was with a much larger, raccoon-sized Havahart.The set and release mechanism on this model is also altered, which I appreciate because the old ones I used were a bit scary during the release part. I took that raccoon harem - caught his three females first - up to a river well away from habitation but getting Mister Raccoon out was scary. Luckily he was thirsty and headed for the river after a brief contemplation of the backing-away human.On the topic of relocation, I suggest being quite careful. People living in the vicinity where you release your problem varmint can become quite offended. Just sayin'."
138,533,3,"When Amazon is nice enough to send me a Vine product for review, I hate to complain about it. But this pan was a disappointment.The design is nicely done:- the mesh of the pan body is fine enough to hold in pretty much anything (even popcorn), while still allowing heat and smoke to permeate- the lid is high enough to accommodate a whole bell pepper or large Spanish onion, if you somehow wanted to roast one- the lid detaches completely for cleaning, or to use the pan as an open stir fry- the long handle will keep fingers (or, rather, forearms) away from hot grill parts- there are four thicker steel rods and a metal ring supporting the bottom of the pan, not just mesh (much preferred if you want to put drippy things down on an outdoor surface).- The lid handle and hinge make it easy to refill and rearrange things in the pan.The execution of the pan I recieved, however, was miserable:- One of the four support rods under the pan was welded so poorly it had come loose during shipping- A narrow metal plate that is attached to reinforce the handle was attached off-center, leaving a sharp exposed edge- The mesh had one strand that must have come loose as the material was being woven, because it was rippled and twisted and generally out of place (if you've ever gotten corn in a crazy ear, you know what I'm talking about).Amazon has a money-back guarantee, and the Vine items are probably the first ones off the production line (before all the bugs are worked out), so if you really want this pan don't let the problems discourage you. But be prepared take a gamble."
469,767,2,"The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison.  However, the poison is Bromethalin.  One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.  The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die, which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this, and it is deadly to dogs (and even more so to cats, but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic, at least from what I have observed!).  There is no antidote, so if you have a rambunctious dog, you might want to consider a snap trap (annoying to a dog, but not lethal).Now, does it work?  In my experience, nope.  I placed these traps along with an electronic trap, and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run (we catch about a half dozen a week).  After 10 days I pried the station open (which is not recommended) to be sure the bait had been gnawed.  It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps (at least I know where the dead mice are) or my new fangled electrocution chamber (which also kills instantly)."
1318,949,5,"The title for this item is a bit misleading. (18&#34; Basting Mop With 2 Replacement Heads). As the continued description states, it comes with TWO detachable machine washable heads...1 head attached and 1 replacement head, 2 heads total as shown in the picture.Up until now I have been contending with nylon bristled, and silicon bristled basting brushes. While they have their good uses in the kitchen for small jobs, they fall far short with many jobs on the grill. You simply can not quickly apply large quantities of sauce/marinade with those types. Also, most have very short handles which forces your hands down too close to the heat and that takes away from the fun of grilling.This is the perfect grilling companion for quickly slopping your sauces onto your meats. It provides quick and easy coverage with a long and sturdy handle so you can get the job done fast and get back to your beer, your lady friend, or whatever. I can not recommend this basting mop enough for anyone who does a lot of BBQ such as racks of ribs. You can really slop a lot of sauce on quickly.The heads screw onto the handle securely so they will not be coming loose in the middle of the job. For cleanup, I removed the head and only hand-washed the handle. I hand-washed the head under running water with a bit of dish soap to get the majority of the sauce out and then I tossed it into the dishwasher along with my dishes to get it looking as clean as new again. I allow it to air dry well before storing it away with the handle. I anticipate the handle and the heads holding up very well.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you love this basting mop as much as I do."
774,790,3,"PROS:-Looks good and is attractive, this copper- like bird feeder is a beautiful addition to any bird lover's backyard.-Looks expensive but is reasonably priced--a good value for the money.-Sturdy, weighing in at 3 lbs and holds 5 lbs of bird seed.-With four perches for birds to stand on, the openings are wide enough for seed to flow easily.-Supposedly squirrel proof, but I have not tested it yet.CONS:-Glass looking panes are actually plastic. It is ultra thin and does not appear durable. I am wondering how this will hold up in the long term.-I am not sure if it can be left out in harsh Northern winter  and whether it will withstand below freezing cold and snow of Michigan, since I feed the birds mostly in the winter, when they need it most.-Aesthetically, it looks really good, but I do not like the silver cord that runs through the feeder and out of the top for hanging. It contrasts with the copper look.-It is not made in America, so if that bothers some folks, then this feeder is not for you.BOTTOMLINE: The feeder looks beautiful and is good value for money."
752,754,1,"I live on a farm in the middle of fields.  During winter, mice invade our barn and basement looking for food and warmth.  So I know a thing or two about mouse traps.  I buy a lot of them.  In fact, I buy them by the case.  I was interested in trying a new one.Being new is the only thing the Nooski mouse trap has going for it.  It's miserable to set, not terribly effective, and when it works it's inhumane.  First you have to set the trap.  This involves rolling a very tight rubber ring around the trap.  That's a pain and I ended up needing my son's help.  We tried tripping the trap and it tripped one time out of three attempts.  We placed the trap in a high mouse traffic zone.  It was located by plain old sticky boards.  The first two nights all the sticky boards had a mouse but not the nooski.  The third night, the nooski caught a mouse.  Kind of.  It actually ended up not around his neck but kind of around his head.  He made it a good distance.  We only found him because of the bright green ring.  I really hate mice and I will kill them to keep them out of my grain, chicken coops, and especially house.  But there is no way I can justify doing that to an animal.  I'll stick with using One Bite and sticky boards."
1271,793,5,"The Remington RM2520 Wrangler 17&#34; grass trimmer is one of the lighter trimmers that I have used. It is well balanced with an adjustable front handle grip. The directions for starting the unit is printed large and clearly on the air filter housing. I find I forget the procedure for best starting over the winter. The air filter is very easy to get at for cleaning, though it is small and will likely have to be replaced at some point. It is just a ring of flexible foam material. By following the simple directions it started quickly and stayed running. The level of noise is roughly the same as any unit I have used.I have an older Ryobi (17&#34;)which is still working and also started with no problem this first time of use after winter. I am a firm believer in using premium gas with NO ethanol. Ethanol is very hard on small engines so... even though the Remington indicates that it can use up to 10% ethanol, I recommend not using it. But don't forget to add the proper mixture of oil to the gas.The string for this unit is .095 which is larger than I have used previously and should hold up better than the .080 for the old Ryobi.The one thing I really like about the Remington is the curved front end of the tube leading to the string. Though the Remington is about 4&#34; shorter than the my old trimmer, it is more comfortable to hold. The string ends up parallel to the ground and is balanced there. I found with the old trimmer, I was always raising up my right arm (back arm on the trimmer) to get the string in the right position for cutting. This gave me a sore arm after some time working.The bottom line is that this Remington seems to be a good trimmer. I have no idea of the longevity of this trimmer since only time will tell. I'm giving my old trimmer away and just keeping the Remington."
841,925,5,"The Perky-Pet 782 Top Fill bird Waterer is cleverly designed. I have filled it with the hose a few times and the water does not leak out as far as I can tell. Last night we had a good rain and the waterer is full. The plastic does not look or feel very sturdy, but I think it looks cute in my yard. My only complaint is that I have not seen any birds using it. To be fair, I work outside the home and don't spend a lot of time bird watching."
532,722,3,"I got the Garden Genius and yes it is a nice product and reusable and works as beautifully as advertised.  The main benefit to these versus simply using gravel is the weight of the pots after planting.  Compared to a couple inches of gravel, this does significantly lighten the pot which may be important to many people.  It's not a big deal to me so the price/benefit ratio isn't that high for this, thus the 3 stars because I can't believe this product is that expensive to produce, being that this is an offshoot of an industrial product.  But if weight is a consideration, then by all means load the pot with this and a fine potting soil and you'll be a happy camper."
749,652,2,"Like the HItachi trimmer that I bought, this unit had hardening of the gas tubing within a year after purchase.  After two years, the tubing was brittle enough that it began to break.  I decided to take advantage of the big warranty only to find out:a) the warranty doesn't cover the fuel tubing (which is what was breaking)b) I'd have to drive &#62; 25 miles to get it servicedc) the fuel tubing is out of stock everywhere (presumably because they are all breaking)I give this two stars because it was a cheap and powerful blower when it was working.  But now I have to go buy a new one and I definitely want something that will last longer than three years!Don't let the warranty claims fool you; this is not a good product and Chinese Hitachi does not stand behind it."
1306,874,2,"These are individual pods of seeds.  Each pod is to be a part of your herb and salad garden; there's dill, basil, tomato, peas, etc. Well, it's cute in theory but nothing grew. I had a couple of the tomato seeds sprout but they died a short time later. I had thought you start them inside in these pods and then transplant outside but you're suppose to plant the whole pod in the garden right from the start. The pods dry out quickly so you do have to water everyday. Once the seeds sprout you then pull out the extra seedlings leaving only one or two to let grow. It's very difficult to pull seedlings out by the roots without disturbing the other seedlings since all the seeds were dropped right in the middle of the pod. Just go buy packets and do it yourself. This was toooo much trouble."
1459,868,4,"This is a good, standard hanging basket.  It's more attractive than the plastic varieties that typically come pre-planted at home improvement stores and gardening centers.  But it is still pretty utilitarian looking - while the metal basket is sturdy there's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  For me this makes it a good choice for plants that tend to grow down and spread, thereby covering a good portion of the basket.  But if I'm filling it with something less likely to grow down or spread I'd probably opt for a basket that has a bit more style to it.Aesthetics aside it's easy to plant and care for.Overall, it's a solid, standard hanging basket."
1675,720,1,"A bag of catfood in the laundry room closet got superinfested with Pantry Moths.  Although I got ready of the bag of catfood, there must have been 1000 larvae in the room.I sprayed the room with an insecticide and closed the door for a couple of days but still saw emerging moths.  Then I stuck in one of these traps and a bowl of water.  I knew to use the latter because the moths kept drowning themselves in the cat's waterbowl.Four days later and I have a water bowl full of dead moths and exactly three moths stuck in their little moth hotel.  Guess it's time to bring in the steam cleaner."
683,276,4,"This sunflower feeder is awesome! It's huge...holds five pounds of seeds and saves me trips to refill it. I love the look of it. It's interesting and not as boring as lots of the other feeders out there. It appears to be built ruggedly. It is not squirrel proof. Sorry. The only feeders that I've found to be squirrel proof are the ones with the weighted baffle-type ""door"" that shuts due to the weight of a squirrel. They are extremely expensive and I was fortunate enough to have one left here when we bought our home 13 years ago! That's the ONLY feeder in my yard that the squirrels don't bother with. That said, I have several feeders in my yard, so the squirrels aren't all over one feeder in particular. When they do get to this one, they don't seem to make as much of a mess as with others. They sort of cling on, pick their seeds, eat them and that's that. No tipping of the feeder, spilling out the sunflower seeds.There really isn't much of a protective covering on the top or sides (I guess that's why some of the boring looking feeders are more functional:), so the elements (rain, snow) will get to the seed. Not a terrible issue if the birds are feeding, which mine are!All in all, I really like this feeder!"
989,366,5,Best of all the new gas cans. This one has the best pouring mechanism of any of them. Really good price too.
822,0,5,"I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks"
513,369,5,Easy quick replacement that keeps your grill new and lasting long. Had my Weber 9 years now. Replaced grates and flavorizers this year and I'm sure to get another 9 or ten years maybe more!

303,251,4,"This did work for me, but it took a few treatments and about 1/2 the bottle. We had a lot of rain around that time and that may have been the reason it took so many treatments to work. I had used other stuff, but within a week the ants would be back. This took about two weeks of continual treatments, but the ants are now gone from around my sidewalk. I can't say it killed them off, maybe they just relocated? But, they have been gone for almost two months and I credit this product for it."
1068,685,4,"I installed 2 AA bateries (not included) and set up the device in about 4 minutes. I tested it and then set it to go.So far -so good. The question in my mind is how long will it last. If it lasts 3 years, I will be happy. I did not find anything more cost-effective in my reasearch but still find this device a bit overpriced for imported Asian plastic stuff."
486,875,5,"Cleaning my grill racks is one of those things I put off until next time.  And then, standing there ready to put the burgers on the grill, I see that I forgot to do the cleanup last time.  Now I will remember because this brush will give the best results if you clean the racks while they're still hot from grilling.  I tried it both ways.  Cold, the brush does clean racks but you've got to put a lot of effort into the job.  Hot, clean up is super easy.  Gunk comes right off with little effort.  In addition, you can clean between with the edge of the brush.It's a good solid performer, and if you like to grill outside, this is a tool you will use every time.FIVE STARS!"
210,692,4,"I have about a sixth of an acre to mow, however, it takes forever because it is not a nice contiguous space. The battery lasts plenty long, it seems to cut pretty decently, it is quieter than a gas mower, and the self-propel feature works well going up the steepish hill in our back yard. It`s heavy weight can lead to the back wheels divoting the yard when I pivot it to turn, especially on the hill. After a summer of ownership, I'm very happy with it overall."
706,588,5,Everything about this washer is well built and designed. The only thing that I regret was not getting a more powerful washer. It's no fault of this particular washer. It's just that if you need really heavy duty pressure strength you may want to consider something more powerful.
943,909,5,"I was very happy to get and use the Sun Joe leaf mulcher. We raked most of our leaves to the curb, but didn't get the ones up in the very back of the yard. I dreaded trying to get them to the front curb, so this item arrived just at the right time.The Sun Joe does exactly what it promises to do. It mulches leaves so they are easier to dispose of or use as garden mulch. It's loud, but you wouldn't expect anything else. It's very easy to use. Just attach your bag or set it over a can and turn it on.It offers multiple settings, so you can get a fine or coarse grind, depending on what you plan to do with your mulch. I prefer the finer grind since it takes up less space and should decompose quicker. There is a setting for wet leaves, but I didn't have any wet leaves to try. I should have saved some for a rainy day, but we were having so much fun that we cleaned up the yard before we realized it! I also didn't have pine needles, so I couldn't test that setting. The leaves that I did mulch seemed to be of a consistent size and it really did do a good job at it.This isn't my first experience with a product of this type. I used to have a Flowtron Leaf Eater (LE-900) and loved it, but it finally bit the dust. The Sun Joe seems to as effective than the Flowtron. I prefer the base of the LE-900 since it pivots, although the collapsible legs of the Sun Joe also has advantages. Otherwise, they are about the same.This is the type of product I would recommend to any of my friends that need or want to simplify lawn care. This seems perfect for small to medium sized yards. It seems to be well made and it's easy to store. Overall, I'm very happy with it. I won't have to dread leaf-cleanup anymore!"
1360,532,3,"I'm a Texan (Texaswomyn, right?) so I love smoked meat.  Brisket, chicken, ribs, pork chops, beef roast, etc. We've got smokers: two big 'ole charcoal smokers, a big 'ole propane/electric smoker, and I've even got one of them Cameron stove top smokers, (I'm gonna drop the bad grammar now) so I was quite curious about this smoker accessory.  First off, it's small. I mean, Rhode Island small. It's about 6 inches long, 3 inches wide and maybe 1.5 inches tall, so the wood you use to smoke with has to be chipped up very small and it doesn't hold a lot; I didn't weigh or measure what it holds but it's probably not over a cup of chips. One big problem is that small quantity of wood doesn't last long enough to provide a good ""smoke"" flavor and create that highly desired smoke ring on meat.If your only desire is for a hint of smoke to mask the charcoal (and heaven forbid - charcoal lighter fluid) taste from your grilled steak or chicken breast, then this little box will do that, to a small degree.  Be sure you soak the wood first so it lasts a little longer and smokes a little more.And hey, Rhode Island - no offense, OK ya'll?"
1284,165,4,"Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each, so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home, we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything, we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works, and you don't need any extra adapters."
601,612,3,"This review was written by my wifeThe Karcher Cordless Window & Flat Surface Vac is a cool gadget but I wouldn't pay $70 for something that I would only use occasionally.  It basically does what it says-vacuum cleans glass surfaces after a cleaning solution is applied.  It is cordless so it has to be recharged after about a 1/2 hour of use-not enough time to do the windows in a house and its simply too much trouble to use it on a small job.  To be fair, the Karcher Vac does a much better job than a conventional squeegee or a paper towel and Windex, but its just not as handy!I can see where it would be perfect for someone who might have large expanses of mirrors or glass in their house..........or someone who washes their own windows!"
1446,796,5,"This is a great bird feeder. The top is durable plastic and the body is solid, thick glass.  The flowers on it are a nice rubbery material that also seems like it will weather well.  It comes with a nice hook to hang it with.  One feature I really liked about this is they put a dip in the top that you're supposed to fill with water, when you do this, it traps/drowns ants who may be trying to climb down the feeder to get to the sugar water.  It's also SUPER easy to fill. You just take the top off, fill it up, and screw it back on, no fuss at all! Overall, this is a great feeder!"
1492,795,5,This arrived on the day after I had my first hummingbird in the yard. I really like the top fill no more flipping over the feeder. I have wondered for years why they didn't make a top fill. I also like the glass as the plastic ones tend to get cloudy over years of use. The only con I can find is it didn't come with a hook or cord to hang it with. I had something here to use but usually you get a hanger. I still count it a 5 star product.
160,587,5,"What more can you say about this spreader? Its simply amazing, it broadcast very well, has the edge guard for precise spreading and it eliminates the need for a bulky unnecessary spreader.I have used this to spread fertilizer, lawn food, starter food, weed killer and many more. You wont be disappointed with this spreader at all i promise!One Con that I have noticed is it will tip over when its not correctly balanced and sometimes leaving you with a nice little pile to sweep up. Make sure you set this on a balanced ground especially when its somewhat filled.Mr. Ellis gives this item an A+!! its made well, does the job, and everyone can use it properly without prior experience."
1617,769,5,I had a few houseplants whose leaves were looking very dull lately. I also had just gotten a few new plants that I used this on as well.I took them all outside because I was concerned with overspray and gave them a generous spritzing with this. It does say you should wipe very dusty plant leaves with a cloth after spraying but I didn't actually do this. It was effective even without this step for me. It made my very dusty plants leaves shine and had a nice effect on the newer ones too.It's amazing what a difference it makes in the home when your plants look healthy and shiny!
31,666,5,"I decided to finally buy a grown up grill after years of making do with smaller camping grills.  This one seems excellent so far.  I was able to assemble it pretty quickly and it seems very sturdy.  I definitely suggest buying a cover to go with it because it is too pretty to let the dust and pollen cover.  It heats up very quickly and I have been able to cook at temperatures from ~350F to almost 800F.The biggest improvement for me is that it can maintain a cooking temperature even on cold, windy New England nights which my old grill never could do."
1200,875,5,"This is a simple but effective tool for cleaning my grill. Here's why I like it.1. This measures 6 x 17 3/4 inches and is well constructed. I put a lot of ""elbow grease"" into two handed cleaning with this and it didn't bend out of shape or break.2. The trick for effective gas grill cleaning is to clean the grill when it's hot (but NOT when the gas is on). I either preheat it for 5 minutes before I start cooking, or reheat it after I'm done with my meal (I never feel like cleaning the grill right when I finish cooking because I want to sit down and eat.)But this won't work if you use it dry. I have a baking tin that I fill with a little water, and dip this in repeatedly as I clean the grill. After I'm done cleaning I just rinse this off and it's ready for the next time. This really does a great job of cleaning the grill grates.3. I have the Grill Daddy Pro, which works on the same concept, except it has a built in water reservoir. It does a good job, though I think this product does a slightly better job. I prefer this product because it's less bulky and much easier to use two handed, and the extra pressure that I'm able to apply results in a better cleaning.4. There is an exception to using this only on a hot grill. I boughtCitrusafe BBQ Grid and Grill Cleaner (23 oz), which can be used only on cool grill grates. I removed the grill grates, sprayed it on, let it penetrate for a couple of minutes, and then used this brush to scrape stuff off--though I kept dipping the brush in water. That's a good way to ""fine tune"" your cleaning after you have all the big stuff off. It's not something I do all the time. The best way to clean your grill after cooking is when it's hot without using Citrusafe.Bottom line: This doesn't take up a lot of storage space (unlike my Grill Daddy Pro) and is easy and effective to use."
1271,657,5,"Since I had the CobraCo Kingston bronze window flower box, I decided to order the recommended Poly box. It fit perfectly, the wire Kingston box is adjustable. The poly window box is very solid and well made and should last a very long time. The brown earthenware color looks very natural with the wire box holder and sits in it level and solidly. After checking around in local stores for something similar, I found that nothing compared in quality or price. I'm very happy with the purchase and it looks great on our bedroom deck."
679,136,5,This glue board is for use with their Fly Web trap ([...]).  THis is a great product because unlike bug zappers it is safe.  it also catches very very small flying insects like gnats and baby mosquito's.
821,942,3,"I love Karcher's pressure washers. They are quality PWs that deliver depending upon your needs. For my needs, the best PW is the Karcher G 2650 gas-powered Honda engine pressure washer. This 2,000 psi electric pressure washer is, by comparison, almost a toy. But to be fair, it's a nice, light, easy to use little thing. If you just want to wash the car and spray some dirt from a small porch, it may be perfect for you. By contrast, my pressure washing needs are significant. I live with a lot of animals and a lot of hard, exterior surfaces and everything gets dusty or muddy by turns. A good, powerful pressure washer is essential unless I want to spend half a day hosing down sidewalks, patios, and driveway. My gas-powered Karcher gets the job done FAST. This little electric unit is hardly more powerful than my garden hose turned full force and equipped with a good pistol grip spray nozzle. And there are all those hoses to move thither and yon. Admittedly only one more hose than the gas-powered washer has, but for me with all the space I have to cover, it's the hose that broke this camel's back. To its credit, the Karcher 2,000 psi electric is easier to start, easier to lift, and more convenient to power. So, if your need is for a relative lightweight, it likely will do the job. But don't be misled, if you've got a lot of ground (concrete, stone, etc.) to cover, you may need what I need, the Karcher 2,650 psi gas-powered model."
78,755,5,"After watching a show on PBS about using a push reel mower and leaving the clippings to fertilize the grass, we decided to give it a go. We have a gas rotary mower and I'm forever frustrated with it. You have to fill it every time you use it because the gas slowly evaporates over time. And every time you use it, the so called spill proof gas can leaks gas everywhere when you remove the nozzle from inside.So, to make a long story short we got out Fiskar StaySharp mower. It came in a smallish nicely packed box with a small instruction manual that is well laid out and explains in plain English with accompanying diagrams the simple assembly procedure. There aren't many parts and only 4 bolts. You will have to have a couple of wrenches or sockets to do up the bolts. I think it uses an 11mm and an 18mm bolts. Once assembled I gave it a go straightaway. I've used two other reel push mowers, one fancy one handed down from a friend with a collector box and a cheap one in the $70 price range. To be honest I wasn't really expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.The mower is easy to push and cuts very well. I cut a two week old lawn at the lowest setting and had no problems whatsoever. The weight when pushing was equivalent to my regular gas mower and cut much cleaner because it does cut the grass more like scissors rather than tear the grass the way the rotary type mower tends to.My first go with this mower I only had one problem and that is more my fault. The rotary mower actually cuts right up to the wheels where the reel/cylinder mower cuts to about  inch inside the wheels so my first mow I left a couple of thin strips of uncut grass which I didn't notice till the next day when the sun was casting a shadow at a long angle. So you do have to overlap your mowing path by an extra couple of inches more than you might be accustomed to. The other thing is that we had some long stiff stalks in the lawn which were over 8 inches tall. These were pushed over rather than cut and were standing up the next morning. The  manual says it won't cut grass taller than 6 inches. So if your lawn is neglected and over that length you will have to find an alternative.The one other thing is that on long grass, it's best to overshoot slightly so when you turn around you have a couple of feet to get momentum and have those blades up to speed. The brisker you walk the more efficient the mower operates.I did  both our lawns about 4000 square feet in 80 degree Fahrenheit weather and didn't feel any worse for wear than if I had used my gas mower. In many ways it was nice not to have a noisy engine roaring away. I can also keep my dogs in the back yard when mowing because they are not agitated by the more quiet mower and the eldest pug no longer wants to dig where the blades are. I always had to keep both of them indoors in the past where they would make one heck of a racket at the patio doors. So peace and quiet and a nice clean cut. If the blades stay sharp as the name implies and  spiel advertises I think I will be sticking with this mower in the future."
1348,858,5,"Hey, let's face it, we all hate taking care of the lawn mower, right? We use it and we put it away and forget it. But now that's all over.I liked the dirty oil bag to take down to the recycling yard and put into the used oil tank. Spark plug was good, too. Half the work is finding the right one. DONE!Also like the fuel stabilizer. Gotta have it! Remember to run the mower to get it into the carb.Now we're going to take care of our mowers, right, guys? This kit makes it easy to do the right thing. Now it's up to you."

992,653,1,"Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily ""Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally"", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles.  The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. I received a reply from them that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders.  They also explicitly said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder.  Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many great properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are plenty) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so."
1310,12,5,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)"
361,918,3,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a can that I received for free through the Vine program.Well it is effective, and is decent. But as others have pointed out you do pay a premium for the &#34;Dry&#34; label without all that much of a noticeable difference over the regular non-&#34;Dry&#34;, even for this same brand.DEET is the only truly effective ingredient though. Just keep it away from pets, and be careful when you spray kids, to keep it away from their faces (maybe get a different spray made specifically for kids, instead of this one, for them).We'll be going on a Cub Scouts camping trip soon and using the rest of this can up there."
31,603,5,"We have way more birds than we ever did with previous seed mixes, everything seems to like this stuff.  Downsides are that we seem to get more squirrels as well and all the shells pile up under the feeder."
438,730,3,"Let me start with this thought: I only need a string trimmer in spring, and fall. During summer and winter, there isn't much growing that requires trimming back. And during those four months, or so, that it's needed, I'll use it for maybe 20 minutes every two weeks. So that's less than 3 hours of use a year.If I were a professional, I'd get a gas-powered trimmer. If I had a bigger yard, I'd consider a battery-powered trimmer. But for my purposes, I don't need a gas-powered trimmer, and the maintenance that comes with one, nor do I want a battery-powered one, considering how my usage profile is so far away from the optimal use of the battery, which leads to replacing the battery too often. So that leads me to corded electric models.The problem with corded electric models is they're usually cheap junk. This trimmer isn't the cheapest, but it's certainly very affordable, and it is far from the junkiest I've ever had, as well. It's easy to assemble. It's kind of heavy for a model that doesn't come with a back strap. It's not the most powerful, but it's also not the least powerful, either. The only thing keeping it from a 4, or maybe even a 5 star ratting is how difficult it is to get the string to advance, and how frustrating that can get.Well, dealing with the un-advancing string does mean the job takes longer, but I've had other string trimmers that were so bad, I just threw them out. I liked this one enough to fix it. So basically this is cheap junk, but as cheap junk goes, it's pretty good."
696,150,5,"This holds up really well, an doesn't kink.It is not drinking water safe, and has a very strong plastic smell when first used. It does the job I intended it to do."
477,694,5,"This was a really smart idea - much better than putting broken pieces or rocks in the bottom of the pot for drainage.  Keeps the pot lightweight too.  I got these in two sizes and they can be trimmed with scissors to fit any pot.  Lets the water drain out so your plants won't get soggy roots.  Also saves in potting soil costs, as this takes up some space at the bottom of the pot."
342,334,4,"The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a ""sensor"") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the ""sensor"" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12"" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week."
795,912,5,"Weber has always made their portable grills built to standards that will ensure frustration free usage and long life.  They haven't failed here with the Q1000 model.  The unit gets plenty hot and is built like a tank.First off, understand that you aren't getting a stand with this unit. You can buy one separately or just use an existing table, or even just place it on concrete if you don't mind bending down to cook, like an old hibachi. The unit uses those little propane cans that are cheapest to purchase at places such as Flowes or Home Desposts. Avoid getting them at supermarkets where the markup can be 3-5x as much for desperate shoppers.There's plenty of heat for cooking frozen chicken, which is usually the toughest thing to cook properly on a portable grill.  However, what I enjoy most is the through the purchase of the griddle unit.  You have to buy it separately but with that, you can easily cook bacon, sausages, eggs, and anything else for breakfast.  I really enjoy this because breakfast is my preferred meal of the day, and the outdoors doesn't get too hot in the early morning.No cons with this unit, except it's so well regarded that it becomes a theft magnet so make sure to cover it up out of sight because even thieves know how great this unit is !"
1121,298,4,"My two chickens share a coop with my neighbor's eleven chickens. We've had a lot of trouble with rats getting into the coop and eating lots of feed, but they are crafty devils and my neighbor has not been able to catch or kill them. I got this trap thinking it was worth a try in the coop, but he was doubtful it would work. (So was the DH.)I read all the reviews here, and we followed the advice to keep the trap away from moisture, position it in a corner so the rats could not get at the peanut butter from the back side of the trap, made sure our chickens couldn't get to it at all, etc. Last night my neighbor set the trap in the coop on a high storage shelf, under a sloping cover designed to keep the chickens from roosting up there. We'd seen evidence of rats there, so we knew they could climb up there.This afternoon, I wish you could have seen the look on my neighbor's face. He said ""I got one already! This morning this big old rat was lying there dead and he hadn't even made it all the way to the peanut butter!"" I wish you could have seen my neighbor's face. He was lit up like a candle, grinning from ear to ear, just delighted.I mentioned to him that one reviewer said the trap only seems to work once on each set of batteries. He said he reset the trap and the light came on, so he thought it would probably still work. (Tomorrow morning, I guess we'll see.) If I don't come back here and post otherwise, assume the trap has continued to work like it's supposed to.I'm pleasantly surprised. It's so nice when something works and is truly useful.UPDATE: Got two more!UPDATE AGAIN: Okay, we zapped six big rats before the batteries gave out. One day I want to see how well this trap will work with rechargeable batteries. If anyone has tried them with it, please comment!"
643,781,5,"Preen itself is great to help prevent new weeds from growing in my yard once I've weeded and added the Preen to the dirt.The difference with THIS Preen is in the cap - it is battery powered to help spread the Preen evenly and avoid dumping too much Preen in one spot and wasting it.  So far the battery has been a trooper and I haven't had any problems.  I plan to keep using it until it completely dies (I'll refill this bottle).Love the concept but it is not a &#34;need&#34;, rather, it is nice to have and helpful.  Thank you Preen"
1094,835,3,"This is one of those products where it's hard to tell if it works or not.  I have sprayed it around the perimeter of my house and in the areas where I saw mole activity and I haven't seen any moles or voles, so perhaps it's working.  It was easy to use and the bottle is a good size."
1366,699,5,"There are so many similar Tomcat items that it is confusing what differentiates them. These stations are primarily distinguished by their disposable nature - after the bait is taken, they can be tossed in the garbage. This is convenient, but does create more waste.  It is designed with a little tunnel, so kids and pets can't easily get to the poison inside. This safety feature will also prevent larger mice or rats from getting in, so make sure to get a different type of trap if you have those.  This size is perfect for my little field mice.If you are looking for a disposable and safe trap for small rodents, this is a great option."
1247,751,4,This is a pretty good trap for the money. It's light weight but sturdy and very easy to set. The metal plates on each end and the top give you protection from the animal inside.  The handle centered on top makes it fairly easy to safely carry it with the animal inside. I don't recommend this if you plan to leave it outside all the time because I think it will rust but for occasionally trapping a troublesome varmint I think it will last a lifetime.
1387,650,5,I have used these before and it is a very easy way to keep my garden going year round here in Arizona. We are lucky to have good weather and I take advantage of it. I am disabled and in a wheel chair. I'm sure there are many of us who love to garden and need to figure a way to do it. This is how to start right at my kitchen table! Then to a sunny room until they are ready for a raised bed. It is very efficient.
983,493,4,"I likedecades round mouse traps. You can see when they are set, or not set or  have a mouse. I like the line round design that allows for capture of the mouth and you don't have to see the dead mouse. You just throw it away"
437,167,4,"There are two issues here.  The efficacy of the repellent itself and the efficacy of the sprayer.  I have used Deer Off for several years and it seems to work well when applied frequently.  I found that again.  I actually got to see my  lillies bloom this year.I was initially skeptical about the electric sprayer.  I couldn't understand how it would do any better than my hand pump sprayer.  I mean really...how hard is it to squeeze the trigger repeatedly.  Well... actually, I love this sprayer.  It allows me to spray a very even application.  I think I am using less and covering more..  I don't have the irregular large bursts of material that I have when I hand pump. I also haven't gotten it on my hands as much.So far this hasn't clogged...but I am guessing it will eventually.  This is the downfall of the product usually.  I go through sprayer after sprayer (I end up using extra windex or fantastic sprayers.  I am hoping it doesn't ruin this one.  You are supposed to rinse it out but that is very messy and cumbersome.....  doubt many people do it...anyway... I love this sprayer!!"
861,688,4,"After owning this for nearly two years I remain pleased with this purchase and haven't used my gas trimmer since.Despite some that complained about a single string non bump advance trimmer, I find it does the same job without: starting headaches, heat, smell, noise, weight and vibration penalties.  The easy conversion to edge trimmer only adds to my satisfaction.The bad is simple, having an acre+ to trim, two batteries sometimes doesn't make it, and the painfully slow recharge time in excess of 5 hours makes it a chore. I considered purchasing spare batteries, but will roll the dice on the newer 36 volt B&D; models.I like this trimmer so much, I just purchased the next generation 36 volt with a nice short 1 hour charge time, and gave this one to a family member with a much smaller yard."
1643,251,5,"I had heard about Diatomaceous Earth or DE Powder from friends so I thought I would give it a try. I had an army of ants invade my kitchen while I was away on vacation so It was the oerfect opportunity to put DE to the test. I put a trail of DE along their path and within days they were gone! It's been 2 wks and I haven't seen a single ant. I would deffinately recommend DE as a safe and effective alternative to poisons. I mean,who wants poisons in their kitchen anyway?"
299,810,4,"I got this more for spraying around the wire compost bins to keep the armadillos out.  And so far it is working fine.  Also haven't seen any mole tunnels in the area, so I'm assuming (with the proliferation of those we've had this year) that it is working to repel them also.Very easy to use, simply hook the bottle up to your garden hose and spray the desired area until wet.Would probably buy this again, if available."
1426,470,5,We had large colonies of ants in our flower bed mulch in several different locations and in the mulch around some of our trees and they started to climb up the side of our house and find their way into our basement. I had tried several different insect sprays that have provided some relief but none of the worked quite as well or lasted as long as this Ant Killer. All you have to do is open the bag and turn it upside down and hold it by the handle. Then you walk along the perimeter of your house and shake the bag. The bag has a built in spreader so too much won't come out at once. This bag contains 3 pounds of Ant Killer pellets and it was just enough to make about a 5 foot wide barrier around our entire house. The barrier was really effective and I haven't seen any sign of Ants for quite some time. I think this is a very good value when you consider the amount of Ant Killer that you receive and how effective that it is. I would definitely use it again.
920,760,5,"These offer a great way to get your smoke roaring. They are much smaller than the blocks you'll use to keep your smoke going, but they get going quick and put a great bark on your meat. The flavor is subtle but definitely noticeable. I let mine soak for about 15 minutes and put them on top of a thin layer of unsoaked chips that will start sooner."
224,531,4,"There are some really good aspects of these skewers. They appear to be well-constructed, functional, and easy to use. The twin prongs work well to hold the ingredients without spinning. Other skewers, even those with flat blades, usually have some rotation. I usually notice this when flipping the skewers, after the ingredients have cooked a while. With these, the food stays put even after flipping the skewers several times.Removing the food is a breeze with the pusher. I really like this feature and have managed to avoid poking myself so far. The solid wood handle also helps a lot. With all metal skewers, I'm usually holding the (hot!) end with a fork and trying to slide the food with another fork. On these skewers, I still slide the pusher with a fork, but the food pretty much goes where I expect it.A few minor points: the steel is not high quality--a magnet clings easily to the prongs and pusher--so they may rust or corrode; there are no instructions beyond the basic insert included with all Tom Douglas products; and in this price range I would expect a cover or carrying case. Otherwise it's a very nice product."
154,378,5,"Not much to say.  It's made specifically for the Weber grill.  It fits fine, and functions fine.  There is no reason to buy a more expensive version. Make sure you take it off before you put your cover back on though.  I can see the cover tearing if you forget.The item functions best if your tools have a string or piece of rawhide to hang them up.  My tongs had lost the rawhide long ago.  They wouldn't hang well, so I just tied a small length of string where the rawhide used to be.  Problem solved."
818,429,5,"I have the weber with the gas starter on charcoal, and the small bottle work well enough and last a while but this lets you hook it up to a full size gas bottle and start your grill all year on one bottle.  Its especially handy if you have plenty of the larger propane tanks kicking around for other purposes.I havent left it outside long enough to see if critters eat it like other people suggest.  I'm guessing that those hoses had some grease run down the line from the grill and thats why it was nibbled on.  I cant really say it has an appetizing smell."
1277,767,3,"Even considering just Motomco's rodent control products, there's enough to drive a person crazy. Snap traps, glue traps, spin traps, and several different types of bait stations. Of them all, poisons are perhaps the last I'd choose (except maybe the glue traps... I hate to see animals suffer like that). While I'm not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it's hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer (this product): Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II: Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It's as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there's no difference there. This one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don't have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don't work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can't get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is stillsnap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store."
572,162,5,"I needed to replace a leaky connection.  I had gone down the plastic route before and it is a fine line between tightening it enough so it will NOT leak, but at the same time, NOT over tightening it so that the plastic does not strip out.  It is a very fine line.  Then I found this rascal and those concerns are history!"
985,330,5,I have a deck with a high roof that at times in the day produces a lot of glare.  Shades work well for the 8 feet between a support beam and the deck floor.  We cut this to fit the top triangle above the support beam.  It does an excellent job of blocking the sun.  We have stapled it into place.  It is porous enough to allow for excellent air flow and has not torn or come lose even on windy days.Very please with this product.  I also have deck shades by the same company and am thrilled with them as well.
1370,291,5,"This is great for injecting liquids into stuff you are going to grill or smoke. It works well, is well made, durable and easy to clean. It also looks impressive."
1329,72,5,"This is my first electric lawnmower, and so far, I absolutely love it.  It is smaller, quieter, lighter, cleaner, and more efficient than your typical gas mower, and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it.  It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box, with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect, and minimize vibration.  Remarkably, a single strip of clear tape held the cover down.  The mower is relatively easy to assemble, and does not require any hand tools.  The instruction manual is pretty thorough, except for a couple of parts related to assembly, where a little better description, and larger diagrams would help.  Although it is stated in the manual that `no lubrication is necessary', lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly, and even finished metal parts like the handle, will help deter corrosion.  The springs in the power handle and grass guard, would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled, the mower is ready for immediate use.  Favoring the right-handed majority, the power switch is on the right side.  The motor starts up smoothly, and is relatively quiet, even when running at full power.  The whooshing sound generated, probably isn't much louder than a large electric weedwacker.  Since the motor is near the ground, and enclosed by a green plastic cover, the sound doesn't carry too much.  Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever, though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel, and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments, from about one inch, to three and a half inches.  The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level, without stalling.  Running a motor with the rotor locked, is not a good thing, so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots.  Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option.  Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level, and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass.  If there are just a few high spots, the old technique of raising the front of the mower, and cutting them down, and then going over the area again, might do the trick.  It sounds like a lot of work, but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area.  The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass.  If you don't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring.  There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass.  Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap, would be a good idea.  In general, the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards.  It is quite soft and flexible, and because it is quite close to the ground, it gets bent around and scraped up.  Possibly if it were made of harder plastic, and raised up a bit, it may last longer.  The wheels look quite sturdy and durable, and according to the manual, the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower, users of a cord and plug electric mower, need to develop an awareness of, and a system for handling, the power cord.  Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern.  What is recommended is if possible, mowing outwards from the source of power.  That way, you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing.  Running the cord over my right shoulder, keeps it from trailing directly on the ground, and helps me keep track of where the cord is.  The mower has provisions for attaching the cord, and when connected properly, there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn, or one with heavy thick grass, this mower may not have enough power, and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker's other electrics with more powerful motors.  This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Easily five stars for this baby."
479,527,5,"Common wisdom is to not feed hummingbirds colored nectar -- and I don't -- but they still love red, and this feeder is an instant magnet if you have any in the neighborhood.  I have another hummingbird feeder already hung, but the little hummers went right for this one and bypassed the other, even though both had fresh homemade nectar inside.  It took no more than 30 minutes to get my first hummingbird at this feeder.I like that the bottom of the feeder, made entirely of metal, comes apart to enable washing the inside.  The top metal plate fits on a lip so that it doesn't leak.  The construction makes it a little awkward to reassemble because you have to work with three parts, not just two, but the seal is worth the extra seconds it takes to put together.I expected a round glass feeder from the product photo, but it is a flattened bottle, shaped more like an antique medicine bottle or flask.  Because some people had complained about the red being only a coating, I expected the exterior of the bottle to have a plastic-y feeling.  It doesn't.  If I hadn't read other reviews, I wouldn't know that the glass is not red through and through.  The instructions recommend hand washing only, with either plain water or a vinegar/water solution.  It is not dishwasher or bleach safe.  The metal hook attached to the top is sturdy.I have yet to find a perfect feeder, although this one is near the top.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
636,703,5,I've used a couple of these pot fillers this summer. They do a great job. Lightweight and drain well. Only thing baffles me is they are a bit pricey. It's pretty straightforward. Put it in the pot to help drainage and it's lightweight and durable. Excellent product.
1670,145,5,"I can't tell you how many bird feeders I have tried, and all went to the garage sale after this one came. Right away, the squirrel tried to get at it, but gave up. I loved it. The seed doesn't spill out with the wind we have been having in the mountains of AZ. I used the cardinal ring with it so the bird have a nice place to land even though we don't have cardinals around. It took my birds a little time to get used to this, but be patient, they will. Birds are creatures of habit like us. My other feeders is what they were used to, so they went there first. Now they are using this one more. It is well made, good engineering and I love the guarantee. The same day I got this one, the squirrel destroyed my finch feeder by pulling out the circle where the seed opening is. I lost all the finch seed, so I went and ordered Brome's finch feeder.  I have been relocating squirrels with my havaheart trap, as I had just too many, 16 squirrels have new homes now, but then a new obnoxious one showed up, so thanks Brome.Two years later: Wow they are just as good as the day I got them.  Since the seed feeding part is at the bottom, you are not left with old moldy seed settling there. I removed the ring, to make it harder for the Jays to take over the feeder and it helped. This is still the best feeder out there, worth every penny and less waste of seed. I went I bought 2 more of them."
887,130,5,"Time to re-order, the birds seem to love it, so do the squirrels.  One will last about 4-5 days unless a raccoon comes along, they'll eat the whole thing at one time.  I've wired the suet cage shut so they can't open it but they'll sure put a big dent in it.  I like to give back to nature since we've taken so much from all the wild animals."
292,9,5,Works great and is easy to replace spool of line string for my Black & Decker 20-volt battery/cordless weed trimmer!  Good value when purchased in package.
1426,842,5,This two ounce container of rooting hormone don&#8217;t sound like much but it will go a long way. I only use a dusting when using it so it will probably last me for years. I recently used this rooting hormone to grow a new knockout rose from a clipping that I took from one of my huge ones out front. It was extremely simple to do and anyone can do it. I clipped a nice little section from my rose bush. I clipped it at an angle just below one of the little branches. Then I got the bottom of the clipping wet and dusted it with a light but even layer of this rooting hormone. After that I planted the clipping in potting soil. I watered it daily to keep the roots moist. About two weeks later I checked up on it and it had grown very nice looking roots on it. For the time being I am allowing it to continue growing in the potting soil and will plant it in my flower bed when I am sure it&#8217;s not going to frost again. This rooting hormone seems to work very well to me.
1663,897,5,This feeder is so much fun. The bird actually go in the middle of it and can fly through. It is very sturdy. It is easy to fill from the top and easy to hang. I really like this feeder.
462,224,4,"This feeder is a darker green than pictured, which is fine. The standard outdoor-furniture hunter green works well.It holds a ton of seeds, is very easy to refill (flip the top up, pour seeds in) and you can adjust the feed holes at the bottom for small seeds up to small sunflower seed.  I wouldn't suggest using full sized sunflower seed, but the small black stuff (bigger than niger seed) seems to work well.  You can lift the whole feeder off the suction cup hanger to clean it, and the base toggles loose so you can really scrub it.  Very well designed, despite being lightweight plastic.The birds only took one day to find these feeders when I replaced their old clear plastic bucket-style ones and the suction cups are quite strong when placed on clean glass.Minus one star for the quality of the green plastic, but it should hold up fine to the weight of birds!"
1106,676,5,"I bought the Weber grill with gas ignition and am thrilled with it.  The grates were a &#34;sticking point&#34; however and I quickly picked up this cast iron grate.  What a difference it makes!I love the heat transfer and the beautiful and classic grilling lines.  The clean-up is also easier, but I've found that if I spray the grate with Pam before each use it becomes easier to reposition the food without sticking and it's also easier to clean up."
1080,167,4,My flowers have lasted a lot longer so far this year. I never catch the animals in the act of eating them so I can never be too sure what's getting them (assuming deer). This year my flowers have stayed around. The season is not over yet so Im not sure if I will need to reapply but for now I am happy.The battery powered applicator is a nice change - no hand pumps and no rinsing reusable containers.
872,526,5,"I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she says it's unique and she loves it!  It's good to have unique hummingbird feeders around, and to remember to feed them year around."
683,167,1,"I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer. They tend to come (and go) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product. Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch. Batteries included (and installed). All I had to do was take off the cap, put the hose in and tighten the cap. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low (in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle)...that's how siphoning tends to work:) ~ After just about draining the batteries, the liquid *finally* started coming out. Of course, I had to replace the batteries after I'd been spraying for about three minutes. Not sure if the batteries are cheap, old, or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days, the deer were back and were snacking on my plants. I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder. Well that worked like a charm. Not! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that's about all I could smell. If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY, REALLY work, try Liquid Fence. I've been using this product effectively for about ten years. You can get it in mixed form (a bit cheaper), or in concentrated form (which is what I buy). That is more expensive, initially, but it is well worth the cost. Here's the link, I hope it works:http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341177361&sr;=8-1&keywords;=liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond! Rotten eggs, vinegar, garlic and tons of other great, stinky stuff to keep the deer away. It doesn't work on squirrels though (I haven't found anything that does). And you have to reapply as new growth appears (deer loooove the tender greens!) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants. Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work. You WILL smell this when you spray! Don't be downwind of it:) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off. HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence:)"
333,387,5,"Talk about being charmed at first blush, or rather first flame, this Weber starter was such a revelation.  Another reviewer said emphatically that the wire cone charcoal placement is the heart of the starter, well Amen.  I found out the hard way, using other starters that were only modestly cheaper, which all utilized a flat internal grate with large holes to allow passage of the flame.  I purchased a Weber 7416 because I wanted additional capacity (about 20% larger than house brand starters) and was stunned at the Ease And Speed of the Weber.  Using about half the newspaper that I was I normally had to use to start a full cannister, curled into a ring, this Weber was singing in moments without nearly the smokescreen that accompanied my Home D. knockoff.  I attribute the superb performance to the smart design of the cannister and the cone internal grate that fosters more efficient air movement augmenting the chimney effect.  Many kudos to this superbly designed item."
1209,102,5,"I have an amazingly good return (sprout rate) on the seeds I planted using this seedling heat mat. What a great idea!This makes growing from seeds so easy.I've learned that it helps to soak the seeds in water for 24 hours or so, or follow the instructions on the packet if they have instructions.Then just sprinkle the dirt over them and provide the right amount of heat. The seeds don't need nutrition at this point, but they do need warm temperatures.I love this product!"
1683,45,3,it looks like a well made high quality piece of equipment. brand new right out of the box both handles fell off. i guess i can glue them back on but this is a brand new tool under warranty.update: i glued the two handles onto the metal arms. it works great. it is very powerful. i like it. it has enough leverage that it can do the big jobs easily.
1141,906,5,"Garden hoses are one of those items every homeowner needs. But the problem with so many garden hoses on the market is that most of them are low in quality and cannot be used without experiencing frustration. These garden hoses may not cost much, but they cause endless headaches and are ultimately not worth the savings.I have used my share of these lesser garden hoses and have found that cost cutting is not worth it. A good garden hose is worth the money and the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose is one that everyone should consider. A full 50 feet in length, this hose is made to last and designed to resist some of the common problems associated with cheaper hoses.My favorite feature with this garden hose is that it doesn&#8217;t kink. In fact, of all the issues associated with garden hoses, the tendency to kink is the most frustrating. This is what I was talking about when I said that cheaper hoses aren&#8217;t worth the savings. Most all of these less expensive hoses kink and fold up continuously. You end up spending a good amount of time undoing the kinks to restore water flow. This Scott&#8217;s hose doesn&#8217;t kink. It is lined with a heavy duty vinyl covering that keeps the hose straight and the coating doesn&#8217;t peel.Once you&#8217;re finished with the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose, it rolls up easily for storage, ready for future use. Yes, the price of this hose is a little steep, but it is definitely a quality product and for the headaches it prevents, the extra dollars are easily worth it."
696,174,5,"This is a well made sprayer with a comfortable balanced feel when spraying. Some smaller sprayer are awkward to use, but this makes spraying a breeze. The spray is fine and even, it delivers a nice constant spray. It is possible to lock the spray trigger in an open position, I'm not sure how useful this is given the need to pump the handle every 10 seconds, but some may find it useful.The user pump the handle on the top and once pressure is obtained you press the trigger located above the handle with your thumb; spray time is about 10 seconds between pumping.One reviewer commented on the opening being too small, but I do not find this is the case. It was more than adequate to fill the 1 gallon tank without spilling anything."
343,237,4,"I've done it all to get rid of the grubs in our yard ... Sevin, nematodes, milky spore, caster oil, among others. Yet we still have the grubs that little pests like to feed on. Next best thing is bait, I guess. We've just put it out ... cutting into thirds as a previous reviewer suggested. It's out and time will tell!"
1543,878,5,"We've been using the Rat Zapper Classic for at least a year under an outdoor roofed area that the wild wood rats of our area like.  It has been very useful in week after week continuing to elimiate rats, using cashews or pistachios as bait.This model, the Rat Zapper Ultra, is even better, because:- It uses D rather than AA, so lasts even longer- You can buy an optional indicator light, so that you can see from a distance when the trap has been tripped.(Previously we tried the cheaper Harbor Freight Tools knock-off of the rat zapper, and it would kill only a few rats with each set of batteries, and then it finally quit working.  So while I usually have good luck with well-chosen Harbor Freight products, this was not one of them.)I think the reason it is suggested for indoor use only is that the moisture of dew or rain could trigger the trap.  We're going to try it on some of our driveway rats (that like to nest in the engine compartment and chew the insulation off all the wires in the winter), but will first attach it to some wood to elevate it above flowing rain water as well as make it too heavy for the racoons to carry off, and will use it only under the shelter of our car engines.Note:  It makes a real difference to use the special Eveready E2 Lithium batteries that they recommend, though it looks like the name has been changed to Eveready Ultimate Lithium.  Regular alkaline batter just do not last as long, and the risk is that the rats will get zapped but not killed, and thus learn to avoid the trap entirely."
29,622,4,"Slugs and snails were making Swiss cheese out of the leaves of my zucchini plants, but I was afraid to put traditional slug n' snail bait out for fear of one of my three dogs getting into it and getting sick.  When the Amazon Vine Review Program offered up Dr.T's for me to try, I snagged it.My first impression of this stuff was that it wasn't working as well as the otherOrtho 0464060 Bug Getta Snail & Slug Killer - 2 lb.I was using when the pets were in a different part of the yard - safe from ingesting it.  However the fact that Dr. T's is pet-safe, made me a bit more diligent about putting it out and trusting in the process.Little by little over a 5 day period I've noticed a reduction in plant destruction and seen fewer snails and slugs in the general vicinity of the garden.  I'm sure it's working, and I'll keep using it for its less-than-toxic properties, but in terms of it working quickly and over the long term, time will tell.  I'm sure it will take diligent reapplications to get the full benefit from this product, and considering the price, I'm glad I have a small garden."
1105,795,5,"I was quite pleased when I got this Hummingbird feeder that the clear container is not plastic, but glass!  I also loved that the flowers (the red part and the middle part where the bird would drink from) are not hard plastic but more pliable.  I believe that would be better for the hummingbirds.It still has that ""classic"" hummingbird feeder look, and the bright red color certainly does attract them (no need to put food coloring into your water - it can actually harm hummingbirds!)  I make my own food at home (sugar water) and refill as needed.This feeder also has a ""moat"" at the top that you can fill with water so that the ants can not get to your hummingbird food.  It hasn't been too hot here yet, but I imagine on a hot summer day it would not stay filled with water long, it isn't that deep."
1457,187,5,This connector hose came in and I installed it on my Craftsman hose reel. It works and fits perfectly and is doing a great job so far. The shiny brass connectors are a big improvement over the original connector hose that had grown old and leaky over the years.It also served as an occasion to service the Craftsman reel which I had been intending to do but had successfully put off for several years. The o-ring should be lubricated to keep it from drying out and starting to leak. In light of the occasion I also put a new hose on the reel and now it looks and works as good as new.The hose was shipped in very adequate boxing and arrived in perfect condition. If you're using a hose reel this connector hose is a good catalyst for updating and maintaining your reel.I'm very pleased with it.
299,255,4,"These pellets are applied directly deep into the tunnels of moles (I don't have gophers).  Highly toxic, gloves should be worn during the application process.  You should also wear gloves when you remove any dead moles (or gophers) that come to the surface.  This product should never be used in a manner that other birds, wildlife or pets can get too it.  Nor should it be used in garden spaces or other spots where edible food is grown.Now, with all that said, if used as directed and placed deeply into the tunnels, no harm should happen to any creature other than the mole.  We put this into tunnels that were in high traffic foot paths (human) and it took about 3 days for the tunnels to begin to collapse.  They have not returned.All in all, this product works and works well.  Just follow the cautionary statements on the label and follow the instructions to the letter."
247,99,5,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill, so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it, I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead, I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer, but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building), and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box, you probably have a defective battery."
941,761,4,I read a lot of the other reviews before posting mine.My experience with this mole trap was the same as some of the others....  It didn't seem as if the trap was as sensitive as it should have been.I noticed a lot of the reviewers mentioned this aspect of it.It did go off finally but I felt it must have missed many days in which the little critters had gone about their business unharmed.There were a couple of times it was set off and nothing to show for it...  but on the third time it did get its mole.So mine worked after a few misses.My experience seems to be the same as some of the others.Overall I had to approve it because nothing ever works perfectly but if it does the job it's supposed to that's about all I ask of a product.
652,267,5,"I have used several cage traps in my life and this one is the best one yet. Some old ones were so complicated I don't know if I ever set it right. This one? Just pull the hinged handle back and it is set.You bait the pressure plate, with the right bait. This is the most important point, you have to use the right bait for the right animal. The trap comes with a guide on what you should use. This model has a single door and that is the kind I prefer. Easier to catch and easier to release, and the fewer moving parts, the less that can break and yes after you catch something, it will do everything in its power to break out. So your trap has to be strong enough to hold what it catches and this one is."
892,627,5,"Hummingbirds love this feeder! Once they get used to it, they will fly right up to your window and drink the nectar a few feet away while you watch them. After setting the Aspects Jewel Box Window feeder and two other hummingbird feeders out, we spotted a very skittish hummingbird in our yard within 24 hours.  Within 72 hours we had hummingbirds one and two at a time and using the Jewel Box regularly.  One week later, we get visitors several times an hour and two of them are bold enough to use the Jewel Box while we watch from the other side of the window.The design is brilliant.  The unit is easy to mount on your window (with suction cups), very easy to clean, exceedingly easy to take in and out for cleaning and refilling, and it comes with a removable ant moat (which you fill with water, not nectar, and which we don't use since ants don't readily climb glass). The feeder is made in the USA, and fashioned out of durable, tough, safe polycarbonate, which will not leach chemicals and is resistant to fading in the sun. The recipe for nectar is molded into the bottom of the feeder (4 parts water, 1 part sugar), and the side of the feeder is calibrated to show the number of ounces of nectar.If you want to watch hummingbirds up close, get this feeder! (We also highly recommend the Aspects HummZinger High View feeder.)"
17,493,4,"They really did build a better mouse trap with this one.  It is an innovative design, easy to use, and most importantly effective."
1599,761,3,"This puncture style mole trap is a plastic version of the older metal ones I have.  It sets easily, but in trials the prongs penetrated the ground between 1 and 2 inches deep.  I would prefer a consistent 2 inches for moles, so this means you have to be very particular regarding where you set this trap, making sure you've set it over the mole run with loose soil.I'd like the spring to be a bit stronger for greater soil penetration.  Now, the set instructions include ""Raise and lower trap until spears move freely through the ground.""  In other words, make sure you DON'T have a 1 inch penetration.  But these instructions are on the web site, not on the packaging.Moles are a frustrating animal to deal with for many homeowners.  Nothing is more frustrating than to set out traps and watch the mole travel around the yard with seeming impunity.  The usual issues are the trap location and the trap set. The mole is really the most predictable thing!One alternative to mole trapping is developing a ""mole garden."" Moles are very territorial, so consider developing an area in your lawn where the mole is happy to forage.  Once you've had moles, you'll probably keep having them.  Those deep tunnels probably last years, so a new mole dispersing to a lawn that had a previous mole trapped out is going to find it to his or her liking.  So keep trapping, or find a way to live with them."
436,61,5,"Dump some charcoal in the chimney, crumple a few sheets of newspaper into the bottom, light the papers, wait a while, and you have ashed, ready to use coals.  This is so much easier and healthier than dousing the charcoal with starter fluid and more convenient than using the electric starters.  If I'd known this sooner, I would've bought my charcoal grill a long time ago!"
1527,129,2,"The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered."
982,484,4,These are good snips at a good price and include a decent sheath.  They are very sharp.  be careful as the blad on the outside edge can be very dangerous but overall a good purchase.
160,601,5,"If you love being outside or just have some extra time then this is the product for you. You can even have your kids help you with this its so easy and fun. This weeder really gets those annoying weeds out of the ground especially the large ones.It may take some tinkering to actually figure out how to properly use this such as getting the weeder in the center of the weed and correct form when pulling out the weed by stepping on the foot rest and pulling out with the teeth closed.It took a few attempts but my and my wife quickly figured it out.Pros:Easy to use, well built and light, lasted through my 4200 sq ft yard and still kicking!!Cons:This will not work with the weeds that are growing on harder ground, you will have to buy a weed killer which I will list further down.I suggest buying a few items with this product:Spectracide 95834 Weed Stop for Lawns, 32-Ounce Concentrate- this will ensure the weed does not grow back.Scotts 76121 Turf Builder EdgeGuard Mini Broadcast Spreader- For spreading, this is a must have!Scotts 18157 Turf Builder High Traffic Grass Seed Mixing Bag- You will have holes in your yard after you pull up big weeds so I suggest filling that hole with grass seeds.Scotts Co. 21701 Turf Builder Starter Fertilizer- This will help the seeds grow quick and efficiently.Remember having an awesome lawn takes a lot of care and sometimes a bit of money but the end result is worth it.Overall great product, I recommend this item because you will not be disappointed!"

1398,731,5,"The Gourmet Genie Smoker/Pressure Cooker is one exciting, innovative product for the kitchen.It is like having an indoor barbecue.The smoker can reduce meat shrinkage by 50% which results in richer and fattier moist, juicy texture and flavor.It cuts cooking time by up to 70%.Cooking modes include :. hot smoke (ribs,meats). cold smoke (fish,cheeses). pressure steam. brown/warm (browning & keeping foods warm). steamThe smoker also has ""delay functionality"", e.g. delay up to 99 minutes, than hot smoke for 30 minutes.This is a state of the art smoker/pressure cooker that wonderfully handles indoor barbecue, cold smoking and an aromatic cooking machine.You can even cook a whole chicken. (up to 4 lbs.)I followed the recipe and instructions for pork spare ribs using my own dry rub of cumin,cayenne pepper, salt and pepper and mesquite wood chips in the charring cup, pouring 1/2 cup of water and lastly adding the ribs. The smoking took only 50 minutes and were moist with delicious smoky flavor and fall off the bone quality. Absolutely amazing !Recipes in the booklet include pork tenderloin, Corninish game hens, smoked salmon and fifteen others.I am amazed by how fast the foods get smoked and how well it works. The taste is very impressive.I highly recommend this smoker to anyone with a love of wood fire grill and smoked products as well as anyone who doesn't have the convential time for these recipes. Amazing product !"

585,874,4,"This is a fun and healthy project for parents or grandparents to do with the kids.Miracle-Gro is like crack cocaine for plants--they love the stuff. Planting seeds in a peat container (actually a recycled material that looks like a peat pot) full of Miracle-Gro is a nearly foolproof way to grow the plants. The included booklet includes planting instructions and grow times for each of the veggie products, so you'll know when to expect them to mature and be ready for consumption.This is a fun way to entice kids to grow food by hand and eat healthy produce grown at home. There is a great selection of veggie products including a variety of lettuces, etc. What better way to encourage kids to try new foods and to teach them to garden. It's good for their bodies and their souls.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to adults looking for a robust vegetable garden for feeding their family. The portions are too small and growing vegetables from seed isn't necessarily the most practical way to grow a summer garden. Plus these plants are born Miracle-Gro junkies and need a constant ""fix"" if you plan to keep them growing very long."
915,39,2,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."

SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.

I discovered these &#34;worms&#34; a couple of seasons ago.  The first time I used them I thought it might have been a coincidence or maybe just one of a combination of things that worked.  The next time the moles showed up I used a bunch of other stuff before finally getting another box of these and within a few days the holes and raised runways disappeared.  I was a total skeptic but these things have really worked.  A box of them isn't cheap.  Fortunately, I don't have a big lawn/yard.  I even cut the worms in half and spread them around the lawn.  They look ridiculous and when you first see them you figure there is no way they would work but you should give it a try.  An expensive box of these will be cheaper than a shed full of other worthless spreads and traps.  If you have little kids be careful as they do look much like candy gummy worms."
580,839,4,"Unless you are a professional omelet chef who flips omelets all day, this definitely isn't a tool you NEED for your kitchen.  Sure, you can put it to use in other tasks, but it best suited for its design--flipping omelets.I'm only an occasional omelet maker, but when I do make them I am confronted with the ultimate  game stopper--the flip. I've tried to master the fry pan flip, but more often than not I send egg parts all over the room.  No fun.This ""Flip and Fold Omelet Turner"" is a clever design.  It's a thin, flexible silicone spatula that can slide right under eggs and , well flip then.  It has a tapered edge like a knife  that gets underneath even the most persistent omelet.  Then a quick flick of the wrist--and your done!The omelet flipper is big too; bigger than I was expecting. It's a little larger than a common spatula, letting you really get under your omelets when flipping time appears. The spatula stands up to the high temperatures, and you should have no problem using it in a frying pan.I feel a little bit lazy when I use this, but you can't argue with results. The omelets I made using this flipper didn't taste any better but they are sure much prettier."
553,785,4,"I absolutely adore the Toro 51494 Cordless 22-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Hedge Trimmer. I have two other hedge trimmers - theBlack & Decker LHT2436 36-Volt High Performance Cordless Hedge Trimmer, 24-Inchand theBlack & Decker HH2455 24-Inch HedgeHog Hedge Trimmer With Rotating Handle And Dual Blade Action Bladesand the Toro is my favorite.It's not as powerful as the AC powered hedge trimmer or the 36-Volt Black and Decker but it makes up for that in flexibility. I've always found it annoying to change my grip when cutting the right/left side of a bush or holding the trimmer vertically and the 90 degree rotating handle makes that completely unnecessary.On top of that the battery life is pretty good and it's quite well balanced.So to sum it up: if you find yourself annoyed at having to shift your grip and move your hands to cut different sides of a bush then by all means buy the Toro 51494. If you don't care then go for the more powerful and slightly bigger B&D; 24""."
1011,701,1,"I found an ant hill in my yard, so I put the stakes around it, but, unfortunately, I didn't notice any difference with ant activity. The hill is alive and thriving. I used the same maker's liquid ant baits for indoors and they wiped out ants in just a few days, I am surprised why those did not work."
430,398,5,"I really like this grill.I used to use a gigantic, heavy metal grill that I bought from Home Depot a few years back. Seemed like I was always buying a new grill every 2-3 years and at $150-$250 a piece I've probably spent $800-1000 on grills. Each grill had the same demise. Rust. Even when I bought the recommended covers the grill itself would last but the bottom where the cover didn't cover would rust. Wheels would fall off, the metal uprights would start to lose their integrity and the grill was unsteady. My last grill actually had the side burner fall off, and the heating of the grill wasn't right, all the heat was in the back right with little to none in the front or left side. So I decided the cheap grills were not working. I had already bought replacement parts for my grill and tried to fix it with new burners, flavorizer bars, propane tubing and it still wasn't heating evenly and the base was still covered in rust.I started looking for a new grill and I already own theWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand know Weber brands well. I like the fact that Weber is an American company and grills are made here in America. Given those two items (brand strength and made in America) I don't mind spending a few extra dollars on an item. And from Amazon if something was wrong with it I have free returns, no taxes and free shipping (2nd day for prime or standard free saver)Plus when I was researching looking for negative reviews, I really couldn't find any. All the reviews I found were positive with the exception of one item on the grill and that's that base made out of plastic. But at the same time that negative was turned into positives saying how it won't rust like other grills and the design is extremely steady once assembled. So even the negative reviews seemed positive.I'm a member of Amazon Prime so I opted for the overnight for $4 and to get a 125lb item overnight for that is a bargain! Placed the order on Wednesday, was grilling on Thursday! I also ordered the cover from amazonWeber 6553 Premium Cover, Fits Weber Q-300 Grilland ordered that 2nd day air (free on amazon prime) but it showed up the same day as the grill and this did come by UPS.Other customers have reported the grill arrived and the box was beat up, I saw UPS as the shipper on those comments but my Grill actually came via Fedex and the box was in perfect condition. I didn't see any dents or holes in the box. When I opened it I was happy to see the way they packaged the grill. Lots of cardboard buffers and plastic. I took a picture of some of it and will post it.I will add that when I was taking everything out of the box I was overwhelmed with parts. There was a LOT to put together at first glance. But then when I looked for the screws I found that there were only 16. It took me about 45 minutes to completely assemble the grill. Let me say that there were 2 items that could easily have been missed in the boxes if I wasn't careful. One was the grates, now they are the heaviest part of the grill but were at the bottom of the box in their own thin cardboard container. If you picked the box up to throw it away you would know there was something there but it was easy to overlook at first. Second, the bar that holds the wheels, it was in another box but under the packing material and I almost missed it. Everything else was easy to spot, and included with the grill, no missing parts.So how did the grill perform? Overall really nicely. So well in fact that night I started to dismantle my old grill so that I could start throwing it away each week piece by piece until its gone. I really like the grill. The light that comes with the 320 model is fantastic. One reviewer said it was to close to the grill lid, I didn't find that to be the case at all. In fact I had plenty of room so I don't imagine there will be any issues with the light getting in the way of me trying to open the grill.As for heating, it's very important for a grill to heat evenly and this Q 320 is perfect. It will take some getting used to for the zone's as all grills I've owned previously have used 4 heating zones and this only has 2, 1 down the middle and 1 around the edges. But then again most the other grills I've owned haven't worked well at all so I'm looking forward to a new design, perhaps this will be better.What about cleanup? It's a breeze. Crank the heat up and let it ""self-clean."" And don't forget to remove the grease pan from underneath to empty it out! I love that Weber makes it so easy to get to, and unlike my old grill it's a reasonable size. My old grill the pan was HUGE, took up the entire base of the grill, weber using small aluminum pans you can buy almost anywhere to dispose of them or you could clean them and reuse them.Overall I am so far very impressed with this grill. Weber has done a great job in the design of this. It does LOOK smaller then my old monster, but the grilling surface is identical. The only difference is instead of a massive hood this one is about half the height. But how often do I grill entire turkeys? Never. I grill burgers, hot dogs and even veggies in theWeber Style 6434 Professional-Grade Vegetable Basketand I even tested that and it fits perfectly on this grill. If you have more room under the grill your simply using more propane, not necessary."
2,578,1,"One room with hardwood floors where I kept a rescue cat and her kittens became infested with fleas. Treated the mother and kittens with Advantage II when they were weaned, and removed them from the room. The boxes and bedding I had in there for them was thrown out. There is nothing on the floor, no curtains, no furniture,  no rug, just an empty room. Seems like that would be easy to rid of fleas, right? I vacuumed then sprayed every square inch of the floor, including window sills and into the baseboards. Some fleas died but the next day there were still live fleas jumping around. Vacuumed every other day. Mixed Suspend with Archer which is supposed to keep the flea eggs and larvae from hatching. Still had fleas live through it and hatch out. Sprayed a third time, this time with 3x the amount specified of both chemicals mixed with water. It has been almost a month and that room still has fleas! That room has been completely locked up and empty other than my vacuuming and spraying episodes. This is just pointless and a waste of money, and made my stomach upset for days after spraying it despite using proper ventilation, and wearing rain boots and rubber gloves.*UPDATE: If you are reading this, you are looking for a solution to your indoor flea infestation. I want to share what I finally found that did work! I mixed three chemicals together at the recommended levels with water:1) Talstar Pro insecticide (active ingredient: 7.9% Bifenthrin)2) Dominion insecticide (active ingredient: 21.4% Imidacloprid)3) Nyguard IGR (active ingredient: Pyriproxyfen)First let me warn that Talstar is not recommended for broadcast spray indoors, however I was willing to try anything that might work. Talstar is a very strong insecticide. Dominion contains the same chemical used in Advantage topical flea treatment (do NOT use Dominion on pets though!). Nyguard stops eggs and larvae from hatching.To mix and spray these chemicals, you must wear a respirator mask and I recommend wearing long pants tucked into rubber rain boots, long sleeves, goggles, and elbow length chemical-resistant gloves. You should crack the windows to ventilate and keep pets and people out of the treated room. After the first spray with this mix, nearly all fleas were DEAD that day! A week later, only a few flea eggs had managed to survive and hatch, and the second spray eliminated them. No return of fleas! Just for good measure, I sprayed a third time (all 3 spraying were 1 week apart), and I left the room with the residue on the floor for several weeks after the last spray. Just be safe I mopped the floors with pinesol twice to remove any trace of the chemicals before allowing any pets to enter the room. This long process may be overly cautious but I didn't want any possibility of a reinfestation by mopping too soon, and I wouldn't take a chance of poisoning to my pets!"
922,255,1,"This product is unnecessary when competitive products from the same company exist -- such as the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent, 32-Ounce.Tomcat's bait pellets need to be administered directly into the tunnels of the creatures. You need to be aware of the environmental impact it might have on birds, and the fact that it will be lethal to other animals, especially birds and pets. As if that wasn't enough, caution should be exercised when handling the pellets since they are extremely toxic and poisonous.Why attempt to kill the creatures when it can backfire and cause harm to the humans and pets and other wildlife, when a successful repellent solution exists?"
744,869,2,"Last year, I planted green beans in a garden.  By mid-June, I gave up and let the rabbits have them.  I tried sprays on the plants, fences, etc., but nothing helped for more than a day or two.  This year, I tried the Havahart Spray Away Elite II.  I've had it a few weeks and, so far, so good!  Assembly was a breeze.  Everything is together except the actual spray nozzle that just screws on.  There is even a wrench included that makes it impossible to over-tighten it.  I took it out in the yard and followed the directions to adjust width of spray area, filled it with water, and adjusted how far out it sprayed.  That was the entire setup.  I rarely see it actually work, but the plants aren't eaten down to the ground like they were last year (and we have plenty rabbits around this year too), so I assume it's doing the trick.I haven't had any issues with the solar power not having enough charge which was a big concern of mine.  Overall, I'm very pleased and glad I'm not having to use chemicals to keep pests away.EDITED 6/9/2013I'm sad to say, after a few weeks of use, the unit has completely stopped spraying.  I've done all the troubleshooting I can and nothing will get it to spray anymore.  I'm very disappointed."
729,745,4,"Overall a very good product that delivers all that it promises.  However, there seems to be a disconnect on what people expect and what this technology can do.Although I had received this product for a while and even played with it for a bit. It was never a necessary piece of gear for me while camping, RV-ing or hiking.  Quite simply, I don't like to park my RV in a site with full sun nor do I like to set up camp in full sun because it would just be too hot.  I'm also not prepared to leave my phone and this solar recharging kit in someone else's campsite or left unattended for the whole day on a trail.However, during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, this product proved really useful and even essential when we would couldn't get gas for our generator.The realities of using this (and any other solar charger) is:1) It takes approximately 8-10 hours to charge anything.  (As the manufacturer commented below, it might take less on full sunny days, but from the brightly-overcast days after sandy and preceding the snow storm, it took 8-10 hours for us to charge an Iphone4)2) Because it trickle charges, the best way to use this with your electronics is to have it charge backup batteries and then charge your phone with the fully recharged backup batteries instead of expecting it to charge your phone directly unless you are willing to leave your phone next to this solar recharger for the number of hours it takes to recharge your phone.3) If your phone is completely drained, there may not be enough ""push"" to start a recharge.4) Once the limitations of this technology and this unit is understood, it is relatively easy to plan ahead and recharge one set of batteries per sunny day and ration use of electronics.5) One of the most confusing things about this product is that there are different package combos available at different shops, online stores and discount outlets.  Basically, Nomad7 is the solar panel part of the unit shown here and the ""Guide10"" refers to the battery pack and rechargeable AA batteries shown here.  There are other ""Nomad7 + something else"" combos available, but the most useful and versatile one is the one shown here.  On another note, The ""Plus"" refers to the USB output that has been increased in this model (and the newer models) to have an output of 1.0 Amp compared to the older models that only delivered 0.5 Amp from the USB output.  The older models are the ones often seen on online discount merchants' websites.  So buyer beware.  Double-check to make sure you're getting the version you need to charge your electronics.6) This kit comes with a selection of USB and micro usb adapters and of course a car socket  so that it is compatible with any car adapter/car recharger you may already own for your electronic toys.7) When helping clear debris from my neighbour's yard, I was able to attach the Guide 10 to my daypack so that my cellphone's backup battery could continue charging without being left unattended on my front step.  I never thought I would use, or be able to use the loops on the Nomad7 for this. But I have and really appreciated it when I needed it.8) Because the unit is black in colour,  the battery charging did get very warm (borderline hot) to touch when in the sun, but tucking the battery behind a white handkerchief solved the overheating while in the sun problem.Overall recommended once its limitations and abilities are understood."
1216,189,2,"When human beings displaced deer from their natural habitat, we did something very disruptive - we replaced it with a much better habitat. Rather than pick among the sparse native shrubs, the deer now have a huge selection of succulent new food, imported into their environment at enormous expense. Not only that, but the suburbs discourage the predators which might have kept their numbers down: the many traffic accidents don't compensate for this.Better habitat - fewer predators = uncontrolled population growth.Result? Waking up in the morning, to find that all the tulips have vanished. Or worse, waking up in ER to find that you've just collided with a deer.In the suburbs, the deer population has grown out of all proportion. We'll welcome anything to keep the damned things out of our gardens. Unfortunately, killing them outright is illegal.The concept of the product is fairly simple. It's basically a low-powered cattle prod, with a deer attractant. The idea is that the deer is attracted by the smell, licks the device, gets a mild shock, doesn't like the experience. If they do it often enough, they get conditioned to stay away. Deer are not particularly intelligent, so the process takes a while. I've been using devices like this for a few years. It works, a bit, but not well enough to replace deer repellent chemicals. The most effective repellent(apart from a fence) is spraying, but it has to be repeated. (Even repellents don't work for the young deer, who are unbelievably stupid, and will eat anything, including poisonous plants.)This particular product is a tad clumsy. Others use a scent-impregnated piece of plastic, which needs to be replaced once a month; this one has a ball of cotton wool, plus a bottle of attractant. I suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away. The instructions confirm this. Apparently I'm supposed to add new attractant every week, and after rain. Not good.The instructions also recommend changing the attractant every so often, 'because the deer get used to it'. This approach works for repellents, but is completely wrong for something designed to condition deer to stay away. I rather thought that the whole point is for the deer to associate the smell of the attractant with a shock!Now that I've installed these things in my garden, I realize that the people who design them didn't realize that they are supposed to blend into the environment. What possessed the manufacturer to give them red tops!I'll continue to use it throughout the season. If it seems more effective than its predecessors, I'll let you know, but initial impressions are not favorable.Good luck in the Fight."
1306,754,1,"It took forever to set this trap, to get the little rubber ring onto the trap was certainly a trick.  I couldn't do it I had to find someone with more agile fingers than I have. I checked it a few days later and the rubber ring was gone and no mouse in sight. I set the trap again, a few days later the same, rubber ring is gone but no mouse. These little rubber rings are expensive and you have to man handle the trap to get them on it anyway. I assume the mice are dead but I really don't know because I never found a body. I'll jus go back to the snap spring trap, I know it works because there is a dead mouse to prove it."

778,770,4,"This is very nice if you have a few indoor plants that you would like to baby a bit.  It's a foam that comes out a lot like a hair mouse might, from a pump dispenser.It's a very light fertilizer, so it shouldn't burn up a plant - some houseplants can be very sensitive.  I used it on my spider plant, my aloe vera, and a green vine plant, and all have done well with it.Miracle Gro knows what they are doing - by putting it in this foam form, the already low level of nutrients gets delivered more steadily and slowly.  Houseplants can be very sensitive, so this helps keep the ends from getting burnt and brown."
895,916,5,"The AeroGarden arrived in very good condition and was easy to put together.  I had to double check the instructions to make sure I was getting the water and nutrients into the tank correctly.  The pods are already planted with seeds so that makes it easier not having to deal with very tiny seeds.  The label needs to stay on the top of each pod because it assists with moisture control.  The label also gives the name of the plant(s), it's expected germination time, and it's height.  As the instructions recommend, it is better to place shorter plants in front; the taller ones to the outsides and middle back.  Placement is much more critical with taller vegetables than herbs which will be used earlier and kept trimmed more regularly than a tomato for example.  I'm at day 12; the plants are all now sprouted and above the label.  The clear caps are off all but two that have just made it above the label this morning.  The caps come off when the plant is touching the top.  The caps help maintain a more humid and warm environment during the germination phase.  There is a recommendation in the instructions to remove surplus plants within each pod which I have yet to do.  Each basil has 5 to 6 plants; the mint is very tiny.  Since it is just getting above the label it's hard to count plants yet.  It looks like the parsley and chives have more seeds sprouting down below the label but it might be a couple days before I can be sure.The two types of basil are ready for their first trimming below the initial leaves to stimulate side growth.  It has been really fun to check it every morning to see what is new.  I grew up on a farm/ranch and have lots of experience growing everything from vegetables to fruit trees.  But, that was in the past, in a different place which is what makes this, sitting near my kitchen, all that much more fun to do it again.Pods are available pre-seeded with vegetables and flowers, or as a kit to put together with one's own seeds.  The lights do stay on for 17 hours each day.  They are pre-programmed on their own timer.  At least that's the way this model works.  There are smaller, less computerized models available, but they all use grow lights.  The grow lights do need to be replaced on a regular basis.  The lights are not expensive.  The computer unit keeps a daily countdown of days until nutrients need to be put into the water, and the water refilled to it's correct level.  There is also a recommended schedule of cleaning the water tank and replacing the water and nutrients.  This is a pretty well thought-out product providing a lot of fun, resulting in a crop of herbs, vegetables, or flowers."
970,703,4,"If you have a pot or planter that has no way to drain excess water, this little gadget helps. As some of you already know, when you over-water plants, one of two things (sometimes both) happens: either the tray that holds excess water fills up, sometimes overflowing, or if you have no tray for excess water, the plant begins to die as the roots drown, resulting in a dead plant and a lot of stinky water. This device can help with that, especially for pots and planters with no receptacle for the extra water. What happens with this pot filler is this: the excess water, so long as there isn't a HUGE amount of it, will pool in this mesh, away from plant roots. While the soil eventually dries out, this can continue to provide moisture to the soil while preventing the rot that can eventually kill a plant. My mom used to use rocks at the bottom of her pots, which was just as effective, but boy does it make them heavy to move around! This is a great alternative to rocks, and it is reusable. Nice product!"
716,525,5,"This trap works just as well as the smaller squirrel/chipmunk sized Havahart trap I own.  I caught a bunny with this one.  Hopefully there is only one in my yard leaving bunny marbles all over the place.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with a bunny, or marbles, but my dog insists on flopping on her back and rolling around in the marbles (gross).  I relocated this bunny to the same place I have relocated 15 chipmunks this year.  I'm sure they are very happy there...much happier than they were living in my yard.Havahart traps are extremely easy to set up, and they are also very durable.  My chipmunk trap is in it's 6th year of use, and has captured 46 chipmunks.  Pretty awesome.  That's like $.50 a chipmunk.I have nothing against animals living in my yard, but they need to be controlled or they get out of hand, tunneling under the driveway and sidewalks, eating our garden, etc.  These traps help you do that in a more humane way than just blasting them with a pellet gun or worse, trying to poison them (don't do that)."
484,599,3,I really like this wacker but it feeds and eats string too fast. Unless your on that trigger and do your whole yard in one shot your going to keep feeding when you let go of the trigger. Havent had to replace head yet (have small yard) but im sure the inevitable is bound to show up soon.
939,370,5,Very pleased with this set of tools.  I've had many sets of barbeque tools.  These seem to be among the best of them. Very sturdy and comfortable grip.  Will see how they hold up over time.
1462,539,5,"Bought this for a friend for Christmas. She didn't have a water can and thought this was simply delightful. It was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be, but should work for most of your plant watering purposes.I appreciate the fact that it was made in the USA. If you're looking for a cheaper can that is still USA made, check out your local Ace hardware store. I bought mine last weekend for $4 and it is about twice to three times the size."
1664,145,5,"This is a big feeder so refilling is minimized.  While little birds can enjoy several models, medium sized birds need the extra perch space this feeder provides. For whatever reasons, the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks don't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to.  The little birds use it as well as the others.Squirrels, of course, can't get any food from it, although they can get the ring off sometimes.  There's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried, but apparently the word went out, because they don't come around anymore.  I've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point.  There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.The feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason, it will be replaced free.  You don't actually need the ring, as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels, but my birds seem to like it.  Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time, they are so pretty, I'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.The large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole.  It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom.  A great squirrel proof feeder.  Highly recommended."
224,478,5,"This weeder works well. Weeds have overgrown our backyard in the few months we've had the house remodeled. This looked like a quick and easy way to tame the overgrowth and it indeed does its job. I probably spent more time looking for a weeder than doing the actual weeding. It doesn't quite make weeding fun, but yanking those weeds out roots and all is definitely satisfying."
1636,835,5,"AsI am a Vine reviewer, I am required to do a review within 30 days of receiving a product.  That does not give enough time to see how the product works, sometimes.  So, I can tell you that this product is very easy to use.  Just hook it to your waterhose and turn the water on.  There is a little lever to turn and it starts spraying.  I have had these types of sprayers that spray about 5-7 feet in front of you and it takes forever to do a whole yard.  This one sprays about 10-12 feet, so it went a lot faster.  It was windy when I sprayed (the only day I had available) and that was a problem (trying to stay down-wind) but on a still day, it would have been fine.  The instructions say that it isn't harmful to humans or pets if used properly, but I couldn't find anyplace that said what the definition of ""properly"" was.  You can use this product around fruit trees and vegetables, but you must make sure the spray doesn't land on the edible part or even the blossom.  Still, I stayed out several feet from my little fruit trees.  I noticed that it got used up pretty quickly, so if you have much ground to cover, you'll probably need more than one bottle.  I have a big backyard, but I don't spray all of it; just where I want to keep the gophers away and it used about 80-90% of the bottle.  Overall, it was easy to use and should be a good way to keep gophers out if it works properly.  But it hasn't been long enough to see if the gophers were run off or not.5-13-14  A little time has passed and I can say that the gophers have moved out of the area that I sprayed and, so far, have stayed out.  I have been pleased with the results, though most products of this type have to be re-sprayed every 2-3 months, and this one probably will, too."

121,904,4,"This fertilizer is working quite nicely with my flowers, which is saying quite a bit as I have a tendency to kill plants. I wasn't sure about getting a product with a nutrient blend so specific to just one type of flower because it it does seem rather narrow. However, in my case, at least, I realized that this was the ideal product because I don't know what the heck I'm doing in the garden, and I'm intimidated by gardening advice that tells you to test your soil and all that. This product allows me to sort of plant it and forget it. It's my kind of gardening."

Slugs in other parts of the yard, but not there!!!"
947,715,3,"Be certain before purchase you understand this is a bait station and not a trap.  Hopefully they eat the poison and die somewhere outside far away. As far as bait stations go though, I like the clear top because it allows me to see whether rodents are taking the bait. I also like the fact that its sealed to deter kids and larger animals from getting into the bait.  It's hard to say how effective the bait actually is at killing the pests, but I have not had any get into my house yet so hopefully they are going into these things instead of trying to enter my home."
