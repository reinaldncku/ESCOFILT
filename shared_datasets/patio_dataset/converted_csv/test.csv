560,266,5,"I don't think I've every enjoyed scooping leaves as much as I have with the Gardex scooper. I was able to scoop and gigantic pile of leaves under 5 minutes!The scoop itself is very well made. High quality plastic, easy to use and handle. I have medium to large hands and had no problem fitting them into the scoopers.Simply put them, on, reach down and squeeze the leaves, hold firmly and pick up. THAT simple and yet so incredibly efficient. A MUST buy for any home owner.By the way, this item is made with pride in the U.S.A."
695,290,4,"I went all in with 12 boxes my first year using these, mostly for tomatoes. I'm no expert gardener by any means, and last year was the first time I really made an effort at planting a vegetable garden - mostly in overcrowded, regular containers that required constant watering and produced meagerly, but what it did produce had me raving in my own mind about the absolute superiority of home-grown heirloom tomatoes. I thought it would be a step up this year growing in the Earthbox, but flavor-wise, I found it's a step back from even the worst growing conditions in regular soil with regular watering.I readily admit, the plants in my Earthbox have absolutely outgrown anything I put in the ground or regular pot. I planted tomatoes & eggplant in the Earthbox and the ground at the same time, and both Earthbox tomatoes and eggplant are at least four times as large as the ground plants. That is not an overexaggeration (possibly underexaggerating). Fruit-wise, again, the Earthbox plants definitely outproduce the ground plants. The thing is, even though the fruits in the Earthbox are beautiful and big, it tastes watery & weak compared to anything out of the ground. There is a certain earthiness in the flavor of fruits out of the ground that is just not there with the Earthbox. While I was raving about the superiority of home-grown fruits last year with the fruits out of my poorly taken care of containers, this year's fruit out of the Earthbox has me shrugging my shoulders thinking ""at least it's as good as the supermarket stuff"". This may be because the Earthbox plants have unlimited access to water 24/7 so the plants get bloated and watered down. In nature, plants don't drink all the time, and perhaps that's for the best. Unfortunately there's no way to tell a plant to stop absorbing water and concentrate on flavor. If I'm taking the trouble to garden at home, I don't want it to be only ""as good as the supermarket"", I want to be raving about the superiority as I was the year before with the regularly grown stuff, even if the production is less.I'm not throwing out my boxes because of this, nor will I stop growing in them. It's just I wouldn't necessarily recommend this product as the first choice in growing method for crops in which you really want to appreciate the robust taste or subtle flavor differences in various varieties of the plant. I would more recommend this for crops in which depth and subtleness of flavor are not as important (in my case peppers & cucumber), or flowers & other plants you're not growing to eat.All said, this product is still great for producing a large quantity of produce in a small area, as well as allowing novices at gardening to grow plants well, and for that I am grateful."
1390,95,4,"I bought this storage product to keep rock salt in this winter. It arrived today and I had it assembled in just a few minutes. Although they say no tools are necessary for assembly, and while it might be true for a strong man who can get that second hinge to seat properly, it wasn't true for me. I had to use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the final hook over far enough so it could snap back and catch the hinge (when you have the instructions in front of you, you'll know what I mean). It was no big deal to do that. I just want to point out that weaker people may need to resort to using a prying tool.The storage bin seems to be well-engineered for easy assembly (other than that one pesky hinge!) and ideal for standing up to whatever weather Mother Nature dishes out. For me, it arrived just in time because later tonight I'll be outside shoveling the walks and then putting down salt.Bottom line: It's nice to find an economical product that does what it's supposed to do, especially when it also manages not to be an eyesore.Update a year or so later: The lid has developed a bit of a warp or twist making it unable to close fully (there's a narrow strip of empty space when the lid is down, showing that it isn't all the way down where it needs to be to rest on the edge of the container). For my use, that's not a big deal, but it would have been better if that change hadn't taken place. For that reason, I'm taking a star off what was originally a 5-star review."
1118,360,5,"I'll just write this review and then go out and clear my neighbor's yard of leaves! That's how much I like this product.First off, I like the size of the collection bag.  When you're petite like me, those huge bags from other makers are just too big.  Another plus is the lever that lets you quickly switch from vacuum mode to blower.  The blower power and vacuum suction are impressive, and it does an exceptional job of mulching leaves for my Winter garden.This is the second WORX yard machine I've bought, and I'm enjoying both of them.  I think they produce a quality product that makes yard work more fun than drudgery."
1187,162,3,"Man, are garden hose attachment departments at the box stores dismal, filled with plastic Chinese junk. Not a quality fitting to be found. Luckily, Amazon has a wider choice and this Gilmour coupling is of high quality.The threaded part is nicely machined and the clamp is a heavy zing alloy. In fact, once on the hose you will notice that heaviness. Should last a long time and when that hose is finally replaced, years later someone will find this fitting in a shed, or buried in some weeds, and use it again, good as new. I know this because I found a couple of brass hose nozzles buried in the yard, fixed them up and they are as good as new, probably over 50 years old, maybe more.Hecho en China....as with lots of brass stuff now. Brass has lead in it, laws here are strict about lead pollution, likely not so much in China. As long as pollution is ok to export, this is what will happen.The Gilmour coupling seems to be the same as the Nelson one, but is quite a bit cheaper. You get quite a bit of heftiness and weight for your money but really, how much should even the best hose fitting cost? Two stars lost for that."
1664,328,5,"I love this thing.  Without bending over I can make holes in seconds even in hard packed dirt, then just plug in the little plants and you're done.  I have lots of tree roots to contend with and with this tool, I know right away if the spot I've picked is suitable or if a large root lurks below the surface and I should move my hole a couple of inches.  The hole this unit makes is ideal for the small plants in flat trays--and of course, bulbs.  For larger sized plants, I can make several holes right together or just wiggle the auger to enlarge the cavity and so far have been able to make holes for plants in pots up to 3"" pretty easily.  I wish I'd discovered this thing years ago.  It makes spring planting soooo much easier."
278,748,5,"""Elementary my dear Watson, if your men don't have proper tools.""Sherlock HolmesVery little is worse or more frustrating than trying to do a job with the wrong tool; trying to force a tool to do something it was not meant to do is a sure set-up for failure, or at the very least, turning out a very sloppy product. Using the wrong tool can make your life much more difficult than it need be.  Sherlock was correct in the wisdom he passed on to Doctor Watson.We live in the woods.  Our home is surrounded by around 100 gigantic oak trees and other lesser trees beyond count.  Leaves we have.  We also have guttering around our home.  Guttering that is in constant need of cleaning we have.Enter this wonderful little leaf blower.Of all the job around the house, yard and garden (we live of five acres) cleaning gutters, for me, is the most loathsome.  I really, really hate it.  The gutters though must be cleaned.  Overflowing gutters can cause great damage to your home, an if the overflowing water washes out your wife's flower gardens...well, life can be pretty miserable.  Now I am no spring chicken let me tell you, and climbing around the roof at least three times a year is a true pain.  I have very powerful gas leaf blowers.  These things are heavy and they are noisy.  An electric leaf blower with a cord is not an option.  Our home is not small and I would need hundreds of feet of cord to do the job.This little battery leaf blower has made my life so much better.  It is not the most powerful blower in the world and I most certainly would not recommend it for large acre yards with a lot of trees.  It simply does not have the power to get the job done. (I have a large lawn tractor with a very, very large raking contraption I pull around to do the yard with.)  But for the gutters this little machine is just perfect.  It is light, weighing only 3.7 pounds.  It is easy to maneuver and is very quiet.  It is powerful enough to remove the leaves that gather in the gutters and it has a nifty little scraper on the end of the blowing tube which is ideal to scrap up and loosen leaves that have become impacted.I use this when the leaves are completely dry.  Oak trees also have little seed things which look like fuzzy worms in the spring time which also gather in the gutters.  I wait for dry days to remove those also.  Once charge of the battery is adequate to do the guttering so there is no running up and down the latter.  The machine is small and light enough that it does not interfere with my balance all that much and I do not feel like I have climbed a mountain our two after using it.I also use this thing on our driveway and our patios.  It does an adequate job.  It is Not powerful enough for heavy yard work though.While I do not use this thing for extended periods of time and only use it two or three times per year, it was well worth every cent I spent on it and it sure works better than the five or six gas powered blowers which are broken and collecting dust in my barn.For the specific job I use this for it is just about perfect.  Keep in mind that I am not what you would call a big fan of Black & Decker product, but in this case they did well.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
209,923,4,"This is a well made bird feeder, that deters squirrels, but is not 100% squirrel proof.  It is a a matter of pouring fresh bird seed into the tray to refill.  Cleaning can be as simple as squirting the tray out with a hose every two or three weeks and letting it dry before adding fresh seed.  The squirrel baffle balances on a small spring and tips to dump squirrels, but a determined squirrel did manage to get on the tray and get some seed through the metal mesh.  This is a good feeder but I prefer, and recommend,  the type that holds the bird feed in a container that protects it from the elements."
215,229,5,"I have 4 dogs in my house, two of whom are real diggers.  Their favorite places to dig, naturally, are my flowerbeds and garden areas.  Two years in a row I've tried to use a 4' x 8' raised bed for growing some vegetables.  Each year the seeds or plants were dug up and often replaced by a bone, rawhide chew, or even a toy.  I'd decided not to even bother using it this year because of the wasted time and effort to say nothing of seeds and plants.I received the Havahart Critter Ridder a few weeks ago and immediately sprinkled it over my raised garden bed just to see what would happen.  My garden bed has quickly become a no-pets zone.  Every animal I have, dogs and cats both, avoid the treated area.  No more holes, bones, or ""kitty surprises"".  I can finally use my raised bed for what it was intended, not the amusement of my pets.Great product, I highly recommend it."
141,883,5,"These are first ever nozzles that I have had that ""do not"" leak.  I highly recommend them.  I use mine for hosing down a couple of patio covers.  My other nozzle always gave me a bath."
414,91,5,"I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening, I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated, I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved, this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect, until this year.  Nothing wants to grow, so I broke down and bought this item, low an behold I have a problem, nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all, (but we really don't.)"
823,6,5,"I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days."
445,314,3,"Wanted a simple, inexpensive system for the raised garden in my alley.  Bought last year's model but didn't set it up because one of the hoses was badly kinked due to the way it was packaged by the manufacturer.  Decided to order another one this year, figuring I'd use 3 sections of hose and 4 sprinkler heads.  T'was not to be... Hose construction has been improved, but same packaging problem resulted in similar kink.  Went ahead and set up my original one (I'm returning new one) with just one hose and two heads. The sprayers worked reasonably well, and the spray is relatively close to the ground, which I liked.  Five nozzles are included - three are a full circular spray, one is cone shaped, and one is semi-circle - but don't think this is a high tech system.  The whole set-up is fairly primitive. The sprinkler heads are light weight plastic - so light that the slightest movement of the hose shifts them , making it hard to keep them flush with the ground. They really need to have some kind of weight set on them to keep them stationary and stable (or simply made heavier in the first place) .  I ended up not using them as my garden has a slope, which meant they had to be propped in order to be level.  I wasn't confident they wouldn't somehow get knocked off kilter, and as this was to constitute watering for an extended vacation it seemed too iffy,,,,"
778,858,5,"I like how easily this stored on the shelf.  It's made so it will store great alongside things like bottles of antifreeze or large containers of oil - it's sorta squared off on the sides so it fits in neatly.It has a built in funnel that's very stable and easy to use - a huge bonus and great packaging design.  The bottom functions as a container for the used oil.My dad was a mechanic for years, and he always stocked Champion spark plugs as his primary brand because he had a lot of experience with it and always said it was a great brand.  Usually just the spark plug will cost you about $4 here - in fact, you'd probably spend $5-6 bucks more buying all these products separately.  Just check your engine on your equipment to make sure you get the right kind for what you have."
559,914,4,"Perky-Pet's oriole feeder is a good feeder if you've got a lot of orioles hanging around. It is solely a jelly feeder, so you'll need to hope that the orioles around your home enjoy jelly. Mine prefer nectar (sugar water). I did observe a hooded oriole come to this feeder once after I hung it, and it hung untouched after that. The feeder allows you to fill up the plastic jar that comes with it and then screw it directly into the feeder; a handle underneath connects to a blade that pushes into the jar that, when the handle is turned, pushes the jelly down into the surrounding tray. This way you can keep dispensing the jelly as it gets eaten. You can also attach a standard-sized jelly jar and it'll fit fine. One issue I noticed is that if too much jelly dispenses it can be easy for the jelly to spill if it is windy.Overall this is a good feeder, it just didn't work well for me because my local orioles don't seem to like jelly much."
778,504,3,"I really tried to give this a shot at working.  I had a mouse in my kitchen that I just couldn't catch - I'd put out poison and conventional spring traps and then this.  We used peanut butter and cheese to bait it but we never could catch him.After 3 weeks, we moved this to an outside area where mice kept stealing the chicken's bread.  We still could not catch a mouse but every morning we'd have HUGE wood cockroaches in the base, trapped, but not dead.  I couldn't even catch a mouse outside.  Since the roaches were causing the light to trip, I added new strong batteries but had the same result. We put a bit of roach powder in the collection cup so the roaches would die the next time they cleaned themselves.Meanwhile, we'd added 3 more spring traps and a sticky trap inside to try to catch the little booger that was so elusive.  A spring trap caught him.  Boy was he fat.I'm just not convinced.  I'm going to keep trying but after weeks of knowing there are mice in the areas I'm placing the trap but still failing to catch anything, I'm rather bummed.It would really help if this was rechargeable too.  The light definitely works if there is something in the collection cup, but around here it's only been roaches and they are eating batteries up."
298,387,5,"This chimney costs more than some you can find at Wal Mart, but it is better made (heavy duty). For anyone regularly cooking with charcoal, this is the best because it uses only a sheet or two of old newspaper to start the coals, thus no charcoal starter or petroleum odor when you are cooking your food. I would recommend this item as a must have for all charcoal chefs."
161,856,5,"This Black and Decker LSW36 Cordless Sweeper measures 37-1/2 inches from end to end.  There is a built-in scrapper at the base of the blow tube to loosen up stubborn debris. It is a thoughtful design.  It is very light, weighing merely 5 pounds when fully assembled and with the battery installed.  Since it is cordless, it goes anywhere.  The motor runs at variable speed to suit the job.  A speed control knob at the base of the handle sets the power to the motor.  At maximum, the sweeper moves most lawn debris including small twigs and pebbles without any problem.  The on-off button is at the handle for quick on/off operation.  The underside of the handle is rubberized for a comfortable grip.  This sweeper is reasonably quiet, much less than a gasoline-powered sweeper.  It makes good neighbors.A 36-volt lithium ion battery comes with the sweeper.  There is a power indicator on the battery.  Push the button at the side to display the battery status.  The purchase includes a 120-volt fast charger.  The owner's manual says it takes two hours to fully charge a totally depleted battery.  I charged my half-full battery under one hour.  I have only one complaint: The LED indicator light on the charger is very dim.  I could barely see it in the shade.  Nevertheless, this Black and Decker sweeper is a 5-star product.  I recommend it to Amazon shoppers."
993,451,5,"Have a big yard project going on right now and need to level out some areas.  Our yard is too oddly shaped with too many things to go around to bring in a large gas-powered tiller.  Decided to take a chance on this electric model as I figured I could control it easier around the many damageable items in the yard (edging, sprinkler system, fences, etc.)Unpacked and put handle on to main body in minutes.  Already had electric extension cord rated for this kind of item.  Fired it up and was surprised at the amount of power this thing has!  Had to get used to handling, it will jump and dance if not controlled but that seems to be an issue with most tillers.  I am short-armed so it took me a while to learn how to control it better.This tiller tore through our hardpan-like soil instantly.  Since time is not an issue, I have been using it when possible on weekends to level out various areas of the yard.  Does pretty well.  We have lots of rocks and tree roots in the yard so it gets jammed often but it shuts down right away so the engine does not burn out.  For a larger area, a gas tiller would make more sense but for a household yard, this is just about right.FOLLOW ALL SAFETY PROCEDURE ABOUT UNPLUGGING FOR MAINTENANCE as the tines are sharp and dangerous.  As with all electric outdoor tools, managing the long cord can be a chore but the cord keeper on this makes it a bit easier.  Can't beat this for the price.  Very compact and even a small person like me can carry tiller with the built in handle."
1043,758,4,"Unfortunately (Fortunately?) my current home and work habitats appear to be mice free; at least I've seen no signs of them.  Nevertheless, I like the design and think it quite ingenious.  The manufacturer doesn't believe this trap needs to be baited, just properly placed, but the number of reviewers who have reported success with baiting after no success without is enough to give one pause.I'd suggest trying it both ways."
263,167,3,"I wanted to try this product to see if it would help me in my quest to get the squirrels out of my attic. Each year I get a new batch as they return to the same spots to nest. My eaves have now rotted out as they have urinated in their nests and relocated a lot of the fiberglass insulation. This created a moist environment and wood rot. Not to mention the sound of little feet scurrying around in the morning on the ceilings.I have tried strobe lights, ultrasonic emitters, automatic arousal air freshener sprays, metal critter traps, and even shot a few with a pellet gun. Nothing has worked and new ones come back. I am going to be redoing the eaves with concrete hardie board to try to keep them from being able to enter in the first place. They have chewed holes in the ends of the eaves and made their own holes in the past.I tried this as one last ditch effort to stop them before the renovation begins. I was hoping to find something that would repel them and hopefully also deter them from trying to come back again next winter as they must be leaving some kind of scent markings to know to return to the same place each year. Alas it seems that those two young squirrels and their mother are rather unfazed by this repellent.I do like the electric spray wand. It worked well to spray this thick soupy yellow tinted slightly odorous liquid into the tight, hard to reach, shrinking triangular eave area of my attic. But alas they seemed to like it too as they are still there! Not even noisy grunt, chirp or call from one of them. I wouldn't have known that I did anything except for the fact that I did spray putrified egg as an ingredient all over my attic and their nesting areas. I wished it had worked. Maybe I am being a little overzealous with its intended use, but still, I saw no repelling feature about it with these squirrels.Have to give it 3 stars. I do like the spray wand."
1575,6,5,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
378,1,5,"After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2"" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8"", but this is 3/4"".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4"" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2"" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink."
1508,950,5,"I received this item for no charge in exchange for an honest review. The first time I tried this spatula I was very impressed. It is very well made with an oak handle, and wide and thick enough you have total control. I love the beveled edge, it was very easy to slip under the food, instead of just moving the food around like what I was used to. In my honest view, this is the best buy of spatulas."
628,390,5,"Amazon offers a very good price for this stainless steel replacement warming rack. Along with the replacement grates and flavorizer bars, we have a grill that looks better than new, that will never rust."
583,960,5,these are durable baskets! they hold soil better that expected. they also great for the price because they last forever!
537,558,5,Love this product.....awesome why use anything else to grow? the aireation and simplicity of this is well perfect! Ill never use anything else
547,306,5,"We had a couple of the smaller, cheaper zappers. The last one was dropped and all the wires popped out so we were looking for a new one. Found the Executioner and this works great! Better made and easier to use than the last one we had! This one only has 1 button you need to push and the grip makes it easy to hold and control. The battery compartment is simple and easy to access...and they give you your 1st set of batteries too!I mainly use these on the spiders that get into the house. Black and now the brown widows are very common in our area. Sometimes there is no one around to come get them for me so having one of these zappers is wonderful! Quickly takes care of spiders and any fly that happens to sneak into the house with no mess."
1486,49,5,"I wanted a patio box to reduce the clutter of watering cans, garden supplies, and other odds and ends that sat on my patio.  This one is perfect!  It's a great size, not too big, is sturdy, and was a breeze to assemble (no tools needed).  Very happy with this purchase."
294,874,4,"I recommend this easy, quick starting garden to both kids and adults with one proviso: if you want it to grow and astound you, take care of it from start to finish.This is a neat idea.  Americans like ready to go, time and mind saving ideas.  Fast food direct from the garden, well, not quite.  They provide 18 seed pods, basically, lettuces, herbs, tomatoes, peas, and cucumber.  There are very simple planting instructions for both ground and pots, planting indoors to start, a paper measuring tape to space the seeds, estimated time to germination and harvest.They include a sheet of label info listing each plant and fertilizer used and planting instructions. One needs a magnifying glass to read that sheet.  Just follow the growing guide.Steps: Plant pod, water and wait.  One removes the pod cover, pushes it into loose soil level, and keep it moist. They provide a packet of fertilizer.The secret to any garden is daily care: weed, water and fertilize.  Don't miss a day- especially early on.  Miracle-Gro offer suggestions on the guide and at their website. I plant some pots, some in the ground.  Less issue with weeds in the pots.  Out where we live, dry, high plains, if you water and provide any kind of semi-fertile soil, the high praire grass/weeds think it's just for them.  So do the deer.  Will work nice on a patio as well, but don't let the sun burn them out.The best part on this system, it's easier to plant and control; seeds don't wash off; the depth is just right.  Not organic, if that matters, you'll have a great garden if you just stick with it.  Happy gardening!"
1518,200,4,"A decent value - for the price, you have a decent buy.  It would not last for someone who is a professional, or for a homeowner who has lots and lots of digging to do, but for an average guy/gal, it's a good tool.  One thing though, if you let the handle get even damp, it swells and gets rough, so don't forget to wear gloves... no gloves = blisters, you've been warned :D!"
1137,479,5,"It's a hose nozzle. It works really well. What else can you say about it? Two parts, both solid brass. My parents have one just like it and have for 17 years. Still works great."
302,926,5,"I have a kind of funny story to tell about these chairs. Shortly after my order was placed I got an email saying the chairs had been shipped. Two days later I was sitting at my desk (home office) and I heard this big truck rumbling outside--and they were delivering a giant box to my neighbor. He's a cabinet builder and I just assumed he had ordered another table saw or some other large tool and I watched the truck driver carefully moving this really really big box into his driveway. I thought nothing of it except that the box was *really* big. That night around midnight I went to my front door to see if the snow had begun (I live in Connecticut, we're had a wicked winter) and there was the giant box: in MY driveway! Apparently the driver had put it in the wrong driveway, realized his mistake and moved it to mine. So at midnight I went out in single-digits weather and somehow managed to slide the box up my steps and into my living room alone. (It really wasn't heavy at all, just awkward.) Anyway, as soon as I saw the Amazon label I knew what was in the box.The surprise was that these chairs were shipped fully assembled! I was shocked. I had assumed I'd be sitting around one day with a screwdriver and putting these together myself, but these were completely and beautifully assembled--and they were shipped one nested inside the other. And whoever designed the packaging and whoever packed these chairs deserves a bonus for hard work. These chairs were lovingly and carefully packaged and they slid right out of the bottom of the box with ease. The cats were thrilled at having such a big empty box to play in.The Chairs: As far as the quality of these chairs, they are extremely well crafted and very attractive. The frames (they are double-framed under the seat portion) are extremely strong and they are larger (wider) than a normal lawn chair I think. At least it seems that way. I am not a small person (I'm a little on the wide side, too, lol) and the chairs have plenty of room left over and they are super strong. The woven seat is flexible, it gives a bit when you sit in it (as it should) but the frames are solid as a rock. The backs of the chairs are nicely angled, very comfortable and tall enough to offer good back support.Of course, it's still winter outside here, so the chairs are living in my den for the moment, but I can't wait to put them out in the garden. They're so pretty that I've actually considered using them as indoor/outdoor furniture in my screened porch, but it will be nice to have a solid, very comfortable chair outdoors, so the garden is where they are headed.I've looked at a lot of lawn furniture over the years and these chairs are as well built (or better) as anything I've seen. And I think considering their strength and quality, the price is reasonable.By the way, the cats loved having the giant box for a few days as a castle, but I eventually had to take it away from them."
55,467,5,These make BBQ lighting a breeze. Thrown under a chimney starter you know it will light every time no matter how windy.
128,167,4,I've been using this for years. It is a great product for deer. Just remember to respray after a lot of rain. That seems to be the fatal flaw in all of these products. The battery sprayer sure beats pumping too!
1177,513,4,"I've had the MM3300 Mosquito Magnet for about two months now, and the mosquito basket has been consistently full. I didn't realize how badly the bat population has been affected by a particular disease over the past year, but the flying insect population has risen dramatically because of it.  My wife and I have seen some bugs which must have escaped from science fiction movies and I really hope the bat population recovers!Assembly of the Mosquito Magnet was very simple.  Three pieces, and they just snap together sturdily.  We have the ""Executive"" model, so we had to charge the rechargable battery overnight.  According to the instructions, this charge will last all season long.  We were underway the next morning.  Within days, the ""bug bag"" was teaming with departed mosquitoes.I've used only partially-filled propane tanks so far, so I don't have the best measurement of how long a tank will last; my estimate so far would be about three weeks or so per tank.  I will update.After a while, I noticed that the MM wasn't attracting mosquitoes as well, so I did have to buy the Octenol Biting Insect attractant to bring the MM back to full efficiency.  Between the Octenol and the propane, there is an expense to running the machine.  The Octenol was $22 for a three pack, each unit lasting about three weeks, so according my best-guess estimate for propane, if you spend $20 to refill a propane tank and it takes three weeks to empty it, you're looking at just under $10 a week to run the Magnet.  Again, this is an estimate I will revisit when I can.I am always skeptical when I look at gadgets such as this one, but in my experience so far, it seems that the magnet is doing a pretty good job.  You can judge by the mosquito corpses and also from the number of buzzing noises you hear near your head when you're outside in early evening, and being super-sensative to mosquitos, I must admit that in both sets of measuring criteria, I am satisfied of good results.Now if only the cost of the unit and the operating price would decrease... that would make me give five stars instead of four!"
1504,693,5,"I was pleased with the ease of use of the test strips. All you had to do was hold them under the running water for a couple of seconds, shake the water off, wait for about 15 seconds and compare to the 'colors' on the outside of the container. They were nearly as accurate as the drops test that the technician used. I was able to get a new, replacement water softener after demonstrating with the strips that the new, original water softener wasn't working."
1582,10,5,"There's not too much I can say about something as simple as a bug zapper other than -- it works well, it's silent (except when zapping bugs), it DOES attract and eradicate mosquitoes and other flying insects, and it's only 15 watts.Happy with my purchase."
553,864,3,"The Char-Broil 12401734 TRU Infrared Grill2Go X200 Grill is a no-frills portable tabletop grill that comes almost fully assembled. I always dread trying a new grill because the assembly takes forever. Not in this case!Despite its small size, it can handle enough food for 4-6 people. If you plan to use it with a large tank you need to get the propane hose adapter otherwise you'll need to use the small (and expensive) propane cylinders. The ""infrared"" part revers to the fact that food that you cook will never come into contact with flames since the grill grate surface is closed. That's where the flareup reduction comes in.Other little nice touches.. the started doesn't need any power to spark and it's solid and compact. You;ll need a high surface to plate it on to cook comfortably.Cleanup is a bit of pain since you need to remove the grate and clean it in the sink since unlike traditional grates you can't just scrape left over crud into the fire.There are no side-trays or other little conveniences and this is definitely a travel grill rather than something I would use everyday."
1041,238,5,"We use these bad boys out at the hangar where rats roam freely. If they don't get scooped up by the owls and hawks, swallowed by the rattlers and king snakes, or whipped up by a propellor (I've actually seen that happen) this trap will get them. I use honey which rats can smell for miles. Works every time."
1315,781,5,"There is NOTHING like Preen to stop a weed.  I have a very large garden, and have experimented with Preen by just doing a small patch and comparing to the areas where Preen was not used.  A HUGE difference, Preen really does stop the weeds....and now they have added a power spreader cap, LOVE IT!  Two AA batteries power the spreader cap, so now instead of having the shake your jug of Preen you now get a nice even spread.I will buy Preen over and over again, definitely worth your money."
841,934,5,"We just had mid-April snow in IL where I live, so this review is a little preliminary. I openned the bag and the soil has a great look, feel, and smell. I plan to plant some flowers in containers, but I have to wait a few more weeks for the weather to improve. I've use Miracle-Gro soils before and I have always been pleased. I'll update if anything unexpected happens."
1473,77,3,I don't know if these helped or not.  The bars seem too far apart to actually kill a mosquito on the zapper.  The sticky things also fall off after a week or before.  Might be a design flaw in the zapper as there is not a solid surface to stick it to
580,553,4,"I thought it was a good sign that when I sprayed ""Safer Brand 5452 3-in-1 32-Ounce Ready-to-Use Garden Spray"" on my strawberries, I saw a bunch of bugs go scattering.  They didn't like this at all!Since I have been using this spray, there are far fewer of those little tell-tale holes appearing in the leaves of my garden.  I never really have a huge bug problem, but even a small infestation can cause trouble.  I mainly grow vegetables and herbs - things I plan on putting in my mouth one day - so it was important for me to use a pesticide that was organic and unharmful.  In all respects I have been pretty pleased with this spray.The only problem is that some plants don't like this.  There are a few warnings on the label for specific plants; Japanese maple, pears, and a few others.  But the list is far from complete, and I noticed my dill was looking poorly since I started using this spray.  I have since stopped using it on my dill, but kept spraying my other plants that seem to be getting the benefit."
985,850,4,I have this hanging with some other feeder on my deck.  So far the squirrels have not been using it (I'm still waiting).  The mechanism seems sound to keep squirrels away as long as it is not near a place where squirrels can reach out and grab it or perch off the the feeder and eat from it.It took a little bit for the birds to find it (not that untypical) but the small birds to seem to like it. (note do to the location of the baffle only the smallest of bird can access this)  I'm using black sun flower seeds in the feeder and they have no problems moving through the feeder.Nice looking over all (though nothing all that special)I live in Oregon so keeping the seeds dry is very important.  This feeder does that quite effectively and in fact I think the squirrel baffle helps with that.
1629,178,4,"Item arrived promptly from Amazon. All items in the box. Followed instructions.  Cut 3 branches and the chain fell off. Installing the chain in a 5 hand job.  Got the chain back on, and cut 2 more branches before the chain fell off.  Took the whole thing to a local hardware store, where the staff uninstalled and reinstalled the chain.  They said the original chain was beyond dull. Spent $17.95 for a replacement chain. Went home and had the same problems.  Tried the new chain, and again was able to cut two branches before the chain fell off.  Sending this back to Amazon.  I don't know if I got a completely defective device or what, but a saw that doesn't cut is worthlessUpdate:After a visit to the local Black & Decker store (10 miles away and gas isn't cheap)it turns out the chain has two sides.  No where in the instructions does it say the chain has 2 sides or explain how to look at the chain and see which side goes in and which side goes out. Since the folks at the local hardware store didn't realize this was the problem, I don't feel so stupid. It turns out my replacement chain was packaged backwards, and the packaging didn't mention the 2 side issue either. For the 99% of the US population that doesn't use a chain saw on a daily basis, clear instructions on chains would be helpful.Update Two:Chain still won't stay on. I'm on chain 3. When it works, it works great. I get about 3 cuts, and the chain comes lose. My next door neighbor has tried it out (he has chainsaw experience) and it did the same thing to him. He says my unit is defective. I took the unit back to the local Black and Decker service center, and the nice kid at the front desk had never seen one. Boy, that leaves a customer with confidence. I'm going back to the service center with chunks of tree limbs and let a service tech try making more than 3 cuts.  It's always more helpful with something fails for the repair tech.Update Three--One year later:Now have owned for 1 year.  I had a gardener who was a logger in a different life use this product.  At first, he had the same problems as I did. After much tweaking and bolt adjustment, it worked fine.  He loved it.  I think there is a very fine line from great to terrible on this product, and if there is the slightest manufacturing irregularity, this tool requires someone with a lot of chainsaw experience to make it work properly. If someone gets a unit that just doesn't work as advertised, I'd strongly advise they have someone who works with chainsaws on a regular basis look at the unit before it is returned.I have still downgraded to 4 stars because I had to have someone else make this work."
1141,403,4,"Nothing adds to the ambiance of an evening in the back yard than a fire and the CobraCo Horse Campfire Ring is a great way to showcase a small fire. Its three- foot diameter and its horse design around the ring make for a more stylish fire containment than other fire rings.This fire ring requires a small amount of assembly and it can be taken back apart. But the fact is, the ring is lightweight enough and small enough overall that there shouldn't be any need to take it apart. Just allow it to cool down, pick it up, and move it easily from place to place. Yes, it is made from metal but it is still light enough that most anyone can transport it with ease.As for its containment capabilities, this device works okay but it isn't very deep and depending on the open space surrounding it, the wind will easily take hold and blow the flames in different directions. Make sure nothing is very close that the flames may catch. And don't expect this device to be suitable for a large fire or for use as a fire pit- it was never intended for that purpose.Overall, this is a nice- looking device for a small fire and it has plenty of good things going for it. As long as consumers understand and accept the limitations, they should be fine."
1273,622,4,"There are two main chemicals used to kill slugs.  The first, Metaldehyde, keeps slugs from being able to move or digest food.  It is the quickest and most efficient way to kill slugs, but is very poisonous to dogs and other desirable animals.  The second, iron phosphate, takes 3 to 6 days to kill, but is safe for other animals.  This product contains sodium ferric EDTA 6%, a different form of iron and with the same effectiveness as iron phosphate.  Like other iron products, it will not kill them immediately, but they will stop eating plants after they eat this. Sodium ferric EDTA is considered not only safe for human consumption, but it actually is used in agriculture as a micro-nutrient, mean it is given to plants like we would take a vitamin.So, for effectiveness on non-edible plants where you don't have to worry about dogs or cats finding the poison,  the metaldehyde will be the quickest and most effective solution.  To get rid of slugs in your vegetable garden or where pets have access, use an iron phosphate product.  This would be ideal for vegetables given the micro-nutrient component.  Just don't expect to be able to watch the slugs die - you are not pouring salt on them, but slowly killing them from the inside.I use a combination of this product along with iron phosphate, metaldehyde and traps.  The traps range from a board or cardboard that I put out on damp ground at night and then scrape the hiding slugs off in the morning to shallow dishes with beer to decorative traps that don't really work but look great."
827,612,4,"Actually, streaky windows bug me.  Our house has some floor to ceiling windows facing the backyard and between the kids having squirt gun wars and the cat scratching at the windows trying to come in and eat dinner 6 times per day our windows are always kind of streaky.  Every once in awhile I would feel some inspirations and go at the windows with some Windex and paper towels but they never really looked that great when I was done (still streaky) and it was a lot of effort (and paper towels).So I was more than willing to put this Karcher through the paces.  Plus the male side of me was kind of excited to add another motorized tool to my collection - the more the better.  So this little shop-vac for windows actually works.  I cleaned and squeegie vaccumed my big rear windows and they look way better than using Windex.  Pretty quick to use and very little streaking - a bit of runnage in the areas to the side of the squeegie.So I like this product.  However, around the same time I also began using the ""e-cloth"" that I purchased on Amazon based upon rave reviews.  The e-cloth is low tech - it's just a microfiber cloth and it costs $15. The thing is the e-cloth gets my windows absolutely spotless streak-free with less effort than even this Karcher vac - plus cheaper, no recharging, less noise, etc.  My wife was impressed with the Karcher but she could absolutely not believe how well the little e-cloth worked.So in summary, I definitely recommend this Karcher vac over the old chemical methods such as Windex.  I would be using this Karcher now except for my e-cloth discovery.  4-stars for the Karcher in consideration of price-value and if you are allergic to e-cloth."
1256,276,5,"This feeder will hold up to five (5) pounds of sunflower seeds, or a combination of sunflower seeds and wild bird seeds.  Its metal mesh walls allow sun and air in to help prevent mold.  With all five tiers deployed, this feeder is about three feet high.  The squirrels will take over the feeder unless it is hung high and on a thin wire or cable strong enough to hold 15 lbs--Yet something the squirrels cannot climb onto.  Since this feeder is metal, I doubt its effectiveness in extremely cold weather, and when snow blows into it.  I intend to use it from April to November.  Its ability to hold so much seed is perfect when I am away from home for a week, because I do not have to worry about the birds going hungry and leaving."

511,355,5,Well I don't eat it but the birds sure do! Very popular with the woodpeckers and many other birds too.
1157,437,5,"UPDATE 10/06/13: This cover is doing a terrific job of keeping my Weber looking like brand new, and the cover itself isn't far from looking brand new either after 1.25 years of constant direct exposure to sun and weather! Not only does it keep my beloved Weber clean and dry on the outside, but it's doing a great job of helping to keep my cast iron grate rust free and ready for use at a moment's notice, and you know how quickly cast iron rusts in damp air. Yay! No more seasoning and re-seasoning the cast iron! It's been out there since summer of last year and it stays perfectly seasoned and rust free thanks to this great cover. I can now enthusiastically recommend it to all reading. ---END UPDATE---I ordered this cover to put over my new Weber Performer grill model number 1427001. It's very well made, that's apparent right out of the packaging (but see update), and it fits perfectly, loose enough to make getting it on and off a breeze but tight enough to make it just about impossible for it to blow off in even the strongest wind.It came just in time for two days in a row of severe thunderstorms with very heavy rains and very strong winds, and there wasn't one second that I worried about the possibility of it blowing off or leaking. It's heavy duty too, a lucky thing in light of recent hailstorms we've had in my neck of the woods! I won't make any pronouncements about long-term durability since only time can answer that question, but my impression is that it'll last for quite a few years. I did note that one reviewer's developed cracks in it after just a couple years, let's hope that was the exception rather than the rule!Although I'd have preferred one in the same color as my Weber (I bought the green one to match my patio furniture and coordinate with my house colors), the black isn't horrible looking by any means, in fact it looks pretty good considering what it is, and more importantly, it'll help you to keep that Weber looking good!Bottom line: This is definitely a good buy. It does what it's supposed to do very well, is well made, and looks great (even after 1.25 years of constant exposure). I hope my review helps some of you make a more informed buying decision! Peace :-)"
857,268,4,"After reading many reviews and suggested sizes to choose from I decided to try the Medium size for my grill. I'm glad I did since it fit like a glove over my grill. It was not too tight nor was it too big. The click and lock clasps are awesome and the adjustable cord works great as well. I have my grill up in a corner on my deck where it is very windy. The cover doesn't budge once everything is tied down and secured. The built-in handles make removal and replacing the cover a cinch. It's well made and feels like it will last for a very long time.*UPDATE* - 7/29/135 stars to 3 stars. It's been a little over a year since I had this cover and it ripped in three separate places. Two rips were along the top side of the open vent and handle and the other was along the stitching at the bottom of the cover where the drawstring cord is embedded. All rips occurred while I was removing the cover using the handles. The bottom rip occurred when one of the plastic buckles became lodged between one of the front casters as I was taking it off. It ripped very easily so it was not like I was yanking it off. I guess after Hurricane Sandy, the winter and the summer elements have taken its toll on the fabric which became very frail. It's listed as having a 3 year manufacturer's warranty so I will be looking for a replacement from Amazon. I gave it 3 stars and not 1 due to it being very convenient and having all of the perks of this cover that others with triple the price don't have. I rather have a replacement then purchase another cover for more money especially that there's a 3 year warranty. Any other cover won't have all of the details and perks that this cover has for the price I paid of $29.*Update #2* - 7/31/13Amazon contacted me within a day. Since my 30 day window for returns have expired they informed me to contact the manufacturer. I was given their customer service email and phone number. I then contacted the manufacturer via email and within a day I received a reply. I was asked to fill out a ""Product Warranty Claim Form"" and to send a picture of the damage and I will then receive a new one by mail. I was glad I did not have to ship the cover to the manufacturer. So far everything seems to be going smoothly with the warranty. As soon as I receive my new cover I will raise my rating.*Update #3* - 8/14/13I received my new cover under the 3 year warranty. It arrived in just 10 days after I submitted my warranty form. You will need to get the model code placed under the cover on a tab, a copy of the purchase receipt from Amazon and have a picture sent along with the warranty form including the model code on the form sent to the vendor to receive your new cover. I paid $29 for the cover so getting this cover at that price along with the 3 yr warranty is definitely a bargain. You will have a headache requesting a replacement and having to go through the return process but it wasn't that bad doing so. This cover will last you a year before it begins to rot and fall apart. I will be doing this again August 2014 since I now know it won't last more than a year. Hopefully the replacement will be just as smooth next year. If not, I will update my review again. Upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars."
1232,926,5,"I have had good success with Strathwood products, the best and most notable being theStrathwood Basics Picnic Table, which was easy to put together, looks good and continues to weather well and last through heat and cold out on our back deck. Sensing that these would make nice chairs to use with the picnic table, I snatched them up.The chairs came double packaged in a large cardboard box, with the chair nested in one protective box, and then that box inserted into a second, heavier, well-taped box. Both chairs arrived safe, sound, and unblemished. Although the chairs are of a light, sturdy aluminum make, two stacked together in cardboard are still pretty heavy, so some buyers may want to be home when these are delivered so they get put where you want.The wife and I both love the look of the chairs. They are extremely comfortable, and mesh fabric gives them a strong but airy feel. The arm rests are nicely positioned, and the whole frame has a slight amount of flex to give the chairs a little more of a cushiony feel. The color is nice and will go with just about any outdoor d&eacute;cor. And they are comfortable (did I say that?). Although we haven't sat in them for any appreciable amount of time, I'm confident we'll be able to relax and lounge on our deck with these for some time to come. We are very satisfied with this product and think it will be hard to beat these chairs on price and performance without getting something much heavier and bulkier, which is why I'm declaring this another five star product from Strathwood."
951,318,4,Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
433,567,5,"I would have never guessed how big this bad boy was until we got it.  It's about 15 inches tip to tip.  Pick it up and you can feel the weight of its solid wood handle, slightly curved for a good grip. The tines feel like they are made of iron.  The whole tool feels well balanced in my hand.  The claw is about the size of an average adult hand, and those tines could rip up concrete if they had to!  They are solid, heavy and tough. They are not going to bend easily.The sheath of metal between the tines and the handle turns freely.  At first I was afraid that it would be able to unscrew, but no, it simply turns freely. It doesn't slip up or down, and it does not detract from the strength of this tool.I can see why they call it the ""Pro"" Series- it would appear to be professional grade.  This one will last you a long time!"
1595,577,5,"I, like many, do not look forward to fall weather when those critters start coming around and have to bait these already stained mouse traps, only to discover later either a dead mouse or part of one. I usually throw the traps away, even if they are reusable, because I don't want to deal with cleaning the lord-knows-what-that-stuff-is on the contraption. Well finally a trap is produced that you can put a little peanut butter in a little cup on the pre designed place on the trap, place the trap where desired in your home and push a lever to set the spring and walk away knowing that 1) you won't be touching or cleaning anything dead ever again and 2)your 2 year old or pet won't be getting whacked by that spring loaded death trap. When the mouse smells the bait, it goes in the small door, around a curve and gets hit with the built in spring loaded trap leaving no chance to excapse the small maxed enclosure. A biohazard icon appears when the mouse has been caught and the door is automatically sealed so any remains including diseased blood, urine and ticks stay with the critter and is ready to be disposed of in the trash. No smells, no cleanup & safe for your household. Simple and effective!"

1391,470,4,"This particular Terro Ant Killer in the shaker bag is obviously not meant for indoor use.  In the spring I usually set out those small ant traps here and there and that seems to do the trick.  I wanted to try this because I had a rather large and annoying infestation of ants on a small section of my lawn that seemed to keep growing.  I simply applied about an eighth of a cup to the area after watering it (a guesstimate).  A check a few days later shows the colony had moved.  Mind you, I only did a spot treatment and didn't use this around the periphery of my house.Prior to application I watered the area and then again after I watered it again.  I didn't see any ants scrambling to grab the granules, but rather they seemed to be more interested in leaving town.  The reason I was interested in spot treatment was because the area seemed to be growing a bit and every time I mowed the lawn I'd end up carrying a few around on my sneakers for a while.  No, I don't like using pesticides (in fact I hate it), but perhaps because of the rainy weather it's perfect for insects around the house.There are several cautionary notes right on the bag, but perhaps the best thing is for anyone wanting to buy Terro Ant Killer is to do a little research before purchasing.  If you have large infestations I might suggest going the exterminator route.  For my spot treatment it was just the ticket.  On the website it has addition information, including information about fire ants.Controlling Fire Ants:""To control fire ants, apply  cup of ant killer granules over and around each fire ant mound. Immediately following application, water the product in completely, applying a minimum of one gallon of water to each mound area. To prevent the disturbance of the fire ants, water gently.  The use of a high pressure hose may disturb the ants and cause migration, reducing the product's effectiveness. For best results, apply in cool weather between 65 and 80, or in early morning or late evening hours."""
1571,792,2,"I live in an extremely dry area, so I would think that the birds I feed would welcome water. After over a week, though, I have yet to see any evidence that they are getting a benefit from this. I recognize two parts of the problem but not the full problem.To begin with, the hook on the top of the container will not fit over many hooks or nails, so I had to use some nylon line to hang the waterer. If you buy one, there is a plastic tie that holds on the tag and instructions (if these can be called instructions), and I recommend you don't cut it off as I did. That little tie should be enough.Filling the plastic bottle with water was easy enough, and attaching the base was easy, too. But that's when I noticed the first problem. Very little water actually came out. The next day, when I went to check, the dish from which the birds are supposed to drink was bone dry. So I shook the bottle a bit and induced some water into the dish. The next day, the dish was dry again. Once again, I jiggled the bottle and managed to get a little bit of water into the dish.I've tried screwing the base on more tightly and doing so more loosely, but water simply does not seem to want to leave the bottle and settle in the dish. That's the first part of the problem.The second part is that the base seems just too small for many birds. In the time I have had this, I must have looked at it forty or fifty times. There have been birds galore on the feeder two feet to the right of the water bottle but never a bird on the water tray.I gave it two stars rather than one in deference to those who love it. Perhaps my bottle is just defective in some way. But, having disassembled it and inspected it (thinking perhaps that the plastic hadn't been cut back sufficiently where the water was supposed to come out--not the problem, I discovered), I cannot recommend this product."
1175,945,4,"My previous electric lawn mowers were some of my best purchases ever. I bought a Black and Decker and Neuton. I recommend both companies. A cordless electric mower transforms mowing. Gone are fumes, oil, maintenance, yanking, extreme noise. A messy, self-polluting, and environmental polluting endeavor is changed to a pleasant one.The CM1640 is so light that mowing is effortless. The 40volt battery weighs a fraction of my previous 36volt battery. The mower is extremely powerful and virtually weightless in feel. I'd prefer a 17 inch mower but the ease of mowing makes my lawn mowing done in a flash. With no pollution, no tuneups, just a nice, effortless glide.The cut adjustment is great. My only complaint is that I'd have liked the verstality to go bagless and use this as a mulching mower. I haven't tried it and I don't think it is designed to work this way.You get two batteries, they charge pretty quick. On a normal to slightly high height I can easily do my 1/8 acre lawn easily. I highly recommend electric mowers. This one is light enough that anyone can use it; kids, older folk, anyone. Extremely powerful, quiet, well-designed. Recommended."
304,872,1,"We have an outdoor hot tub and very hard water, so with all we have to add to keep the ph level in a good range, we often seem to get sudsy foam. I normally use another product, but tried this one the last time we needed it, and I have to say, I don't care for it. Although it did get rid of the foam quickly, as another reviewer mentioned, we also go a yellow ring around the top of the water. With my normal product, I love the smell. Clean, fresh, not full of chemical smells. This Orb-3,. unfortunately, had a terrible smell to it and even after running the spa for 24 hours I could still smell that awful smell.Sorry, but I don't recommend this product."
738,918,4,"My enjoyment of the great outdoors diminishes significantly with the appearance of biting insects. Mosquitoes, flies and deer ticks are pests in my area. Although I prefer natural formulations, they tend not to last as long as commercial applications and the constant reapplication is inconvenient and annoying. This spray contains 25% DEET and a promise to repel the blood suckers for up to ten hours. It is sweat resistant.Unlike many commercial preparations, this one was dry in a matter of seconds. The odor was pleasantly light and quickly disappeared. It was not sticky or oily. I spent a good six  hours outside working to prepare an area for my garden. I was happily undisturbed by insects and didn't smell like a walking citronella stick. I experienced no side effects and was generally pleased with its performance.Care must be taken when spraying on material other than cotton, wool and nylon. It may damage leather and synthetics as well as impact watch crystals, painted or varnished surfaces and plastics. This is unfortunate because when walking my dogs through wooded areas, I like to spray repellant on my boots or shoes and clothes to discourage hitchhikers. Be careful when applying to children and avoid using near the eyes, and mouth. Use your hands to administer to your face.Overall, this is an effective and reliable repellant. It sprays without clogging and I appreciated the ease with which the cap locked by rotating. It is unnoticeable when wearing with no repulsive odor or unpleasant feel. I liked the single application and think this is a fine choice for people who spend large amounts of time outdoors, whether for work or play. Recommended."
299,239,5,"This is your typical wooden mouse trap.  Bait the trap on the plastic bait tray (using cheese, peanut butter or the Tomcat attractant gel), spring load the metal bar and set it in place.  More than strong enough to kill the mice and loud enough that you will know when the trap has been tripped.  Great for homes where only traditional traps can be used."

604,799,5,"the more that you shake up the can before you first use it, the better the results from the spray distance to the kill ratio..it definitely does the job but as with all products of this type, one must be careful for kids and/or animals in the way..."
446,688,4,"I previously had gas trimmers, and I'm never going back to them. I actually spent $200 on my last trimmer which was a Troy-Built -- great brand, or so I thought. Within the second use it started stalling on new gas and fresh oil, and then after a month had it in the shop due to malfunction that made it so it wouldn't even run full throttle. It still didn't work after the ""fix"", and with that I made up my mind that I needed to look into buying an alternative product.I went to Lowes and decided to look at their trimmer selection. This trimmer was not one of their selections, and when I looked at the ones they DID have, and skimmed their reviews, nearly every single one of them were horrible! I decided maybe Lowes shouldn't get my business, so I went on Amazon and decided to give it a go.I found this one after a bit of digging, and wondered if I should get this, a 24-V or if an 18V would suffice. I decided on this one, but had one thought... The reviews on nearly every battery powered trimmer blast the battery life per use. My question was, ""Ok is 20min x2 batteries a sufficient amount of time to trim what needs to be trimmed?""I don't have a huge yard, however it is in the city. This said, I have fences all around my yard, some of them chain link. With any gas trimmer I would constantly have issues with the wire getting stuck during use and having the trimmer nearly pulled out of my hands. It made me give up trimming most of the grass around the fences. Let me tell you that with the guard in place, this is NOT a problem with this trimmer. I was more than a little excited about this, as the fences always looked like junk!My yard also has a fair sized shed, a few places the mower just can't get, and an above ground pool and deck, the periphery all needing trimmed. In my front yard I have a sidewalk and a few trees that also need trimmed.I had let these get a little out of control lately as I didn't have a well-functioning trimmer! I would get the best I could with the mower, but after mowing three times this year alone, I realized I needed to get this trimmer ASAP. I started out with one battery (both were charged) and had the other as a ""just in case"".The thing with electric trimmers is you don't need to have them turned on constantly. When you stand up, you release the trigger. When you walk to another part of the yard, you release the trigger. So when they say, ""20min"" they mean of constant or cumulative use. I trimmed the entire yard with ONE battery, and it was still ready for more!I do have to say the actual cutting line is only on one side, so it doesn't cut *quite* as quickly as the gas ones. Also, the gas one that I had definitely had a bit more torque / horsepower ... though I did pay over twice the price for it, so I should HOPE it worked better/faster!If you have a small to average sized lawn, don't feel like stomping over the wires like you would for a plug-in unit, and want to be honestly generally happy with your purchase, just do yourself a favor and get this thing!If I do have problems, I will update this to reflect it, btw. I have only had it a week, so obviously we have to give it time.(Update 5/29/12)Still going strong and makes short work of the trimming I have to do. I have one suggestion as the batteries don't hold full charges for extended periods. When you trim your lawn, put the non-used battery on the charger. When you're finished, don't charge the battery just used until you trim again. Then remove the one that's been on there for a while, and put the one you used last week on the charger. I say this because I did have ONE instance where my battery died, but that was because I took it off the charger three or four days before I trimmed and it didn't last. I had the other charged, luckily, so that was a non-issue."
284,604,5,I've added this to two different feeders and the birds are eating it up. I get a lot of song birds with this blend.
490,260,4,You just squeeze this attractant on to your regular mouse trap.  It is used instead of peanut butter or cheese.  It is very easy to use and I have already caught a mouse so it seems to be working so far.  It did attract one mouse to the trap and the trap caught him.  I just used a small drop on the trap.
1437,681,4,"I'm truly impressed - I didn't expect much for the price and the size of this thing, having been more accustomed to its much larger kin.  We just wanted something to turn over some flower beds and work up some parts of the yard we wanted to reseed, and I bought this not expecting much.  Pleasant surprise.You're not going to turn over a huge garden with this, but for the price it's quite a good value.  It was much more powerful than we'd expected, particularly for an electric motor.  I strongly recommend it for the average residential user who needs to keep up a few beds and not give up half the garage to a full sized monster.  Watch out for the cord!  It's powerful enough that it will chop right through it if you're not careful, and the cord is the only downside.  It's more convenient than a battery that runs down, but you do have to learn to work around it."
801,337,2,"The best thing about this feeder is its huge 48 ounce capacity. If you're looking for something you can fill up and then forget about for a long time, this may be it. Otherwise, it's all plastic and looks cheap. I'd invest in a smaller glass/metal feeder instead."
343,432,3,"I ordered this in February, expecting to use it soon, but winter's weather has not lessened her grip. As soon as the snow cover melts, I'll put this out in the yard and I hope the little buggers go scurrying. Will update that soon.Reviewing this product right now seems a bit unfair to the manufacturer of this product, but then so does the new Amazon Vine policy which requires 100% compliance on reviews.Thank you!"
1316,353,3,"Peat Pots.... not much to say.  Hold their shape well, and slowly disentegrate over time once planted.  Work great for transplants and plantings."
1227,797,5,I received this hummingbird feeder today and I am very pleased with it.  It's a beautiful cobalt blue and the antique silver base is a nice compliment to the glass color.  It a very sturdy feeder and the glass is nice and thick. The only caveat is that there's no hanging cord with it and the metal ring at the top isn't large enough to hook it over the metal hook I hang my feeders from so I had to fashion a hanger for it using some clip rings. It looks just lovely hanging off the deck in the sun and the hummingbirds seem to like it as well!
1072,45,5,"Trees and shrubs grow year-round here in Hawaii, and trimming is a constant job. I much prefer using this&#8212;no cords, more control and a bit of exercise&#8212;over an electric trimmer."
182,762,3,"These clips seem like a good idea but execution of use is not as easy as you would think.The little leaf ends are supposed to be ergonomically designed for your thumb and forefinger. Any pressure to the outside and they give without accomplishing the task of opening the clip. However, you can close them with one hand but two hands are easier. The clips are big enough for a stake and a stalk up to &#34; but be careful because at that size, it will be tight.They are sturdy enough for smaller stalks but a heavier plant may have issues with the strength of the plastic.Nice that they are made in the USA. That is a big plus in their favor!"
513,30,5,Great Product! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time. However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill. The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced.
143,796,5,"This is definitely an upgrade from my bargain store hummingbird feeder.  At first, I got a feeder to see if I could even attract any hummingbirds.  After a week I found that there were at least 5 hummingbirds fighting over my single-opening feeder.  This one has 4 ""stations"" so there is less fighting though I still have a ""bully"" dominant bird in the group.As for the feeder, this one has a huge capacity.  The glass container is easily washable and it is easy to re-assemble after cleaning.  As one reviewer pointed out, the plastic bottom is a bit flimsy and you shouldn't screw it on too tight.  This feeder is really easy to fill and doesn't leak when transporting it.  I have not had a problem with ants (yet) and I am somewhat skeptical of the ant moat.  I guess time will tell.  I might take the advice of coating the hanging wire with petroleum jelly.  Bees/wasps haven't been much of a problem with this feeder like they were with my cheaper feeder.I make my own nectar, and doing so is something you can easily web-search if you don't know how to do it.The feeder arrived in a large box with no packaging (bubble wrap, etc.) around it, just the feeder thrown into a box with a sheet of packing paper that wasn't even in contact with the feeder.Overall, I like this feeder and I hope that it survives the hot FL sun.  The hummers seem to enjoy it as much as I like watching them dart about.  This is an item I would order again."
549,504,3,"The biggest positive going for this trap is that it really works. Other great features include easy set up and a not too gnarly mouse disposal process.After placing the trap in our basement utility room one evening I checked it the next morning and found the ""Mouse Kill"" (green) Indicator Light blinking. At least one rodent had met its demise. I could have left it until the light changed to indicate the trap was full, but I did not like the idea of leaving a little dead mouse body to further decompose.I removed and emptied the ""rodent receptacle"" (really, that's what it's called in the instructions). The trap had bagged one little mouse. Setting it back up was especially easy since the peanut butter was still completely intact.That was yesterday. This morning I found the trap's indicator light slowly blinking red which the instructions say means it is time to replace the batteries. That one little mouse must have been quite the fighter! Or, this thing burns through batteries way too quickly...I am giving it a 5 Star rating in the area of effectiveness. It worked as promised, like a champ. In the area of efficiency, I have to give it the lowest rating possible, 1 Star, for needing new batteries so quickly.Overall, my rating comes in at 3 Stars. Once I get new batteries in it, I will follow up and adjust the rating if it turns out that it is not necessary to replace the batteries after every kill."
1242,780,5,"I have been in search of a good hose management solution since I bought my house.  I've tried several brands of rolling carts, and they all end up leaking or breaking.  So we ended up with just a balled up hose in the garage.  This holder has solved the problem!  While it's not as convenient as a wheeled cart, it is much nicer looking and smaller.  Rolling the hose up does take a couple of minutes, but that's a small price to pay for the a nice tidy package.  The color is pretty accurate as shown, the cap is very handy too, keeps most of the bugs out.  It appears to be sturdy and well built, I would imagine it will last many years."
574,539,4,+ Looks better than a standard watering can sitting around the house.+ Accurate pouring into small spaces/gaps- Spout is a bit drippy because it ends more horizontal.  You have to tilt the can all the way back to horizontal and wait a while for the water to drain from the spout back into the can before leaving the plant you're watering.- I find it a bit small for watering all but my smallest plants.  I wish it was larger.-Mold quality is a bit roughOverall I like it.

1082,301,4,What do you say about a chain for a chain saw?  They look good and if they fit my saw when I make my first change they will be fine.  The saw only came with one chain installed so thought it wise to have a couple on hand.
1535,121,5,Great mouse traps. an upgrade to the wooden ones. My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try. the same night i caught one. These things will get them becaue they have to use there legs to trip the trap.
1446,229,4,"I got this b/c we have Beagles who keep digging out, so I spread it along the base of the fence.  It has a nice pour spout that pops out of the top and handle, so that makes it very easy to spread, although it does come out quickly b/c the pour spout opening is quite large.  It is the consistency of sand, so it's not visible once it's spread on the ground.  It's been about 1 week and so far it seems to be working, our dogs and the neighbor dogs on the other side of the fence have been avoiding that area and our dogs have not attempted to dig anywhere near the fence where the granuals are spread."
1647,22,5,"It's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder.  This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons.  It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions."
1434,669,5,"The kitchen needed scissors.  The garden basket needed scissors.  So did the craft room, the bathroom, the kids....you get the picture, there is always a reason to be grabbing for a pair of scissors (from clipping coupons, opening a package to snipping an uneven piece of hair).  But the scissors are never where I need them to be when I need them!This pair of scissors is perfect for ALL of my needs.  They come apart to make a sturdy little knife with a saw blade (works great for crafts & gardening), they're strong enough to clip garden items, craft items, food items, packaging yet sharp enough to snip hair, fabric and paper because there is an included scissor sharpener.  Since there is also a handy slip on sheath (to keep you from cutting yourself), you can keep them on your tool belt or in a pocket if you're out in the garden.Sometimes it's the simple things that make life pleasant and these definitely qualify.  I'm going to get an extra pair to keep in the car for when we're traveling and always need a pair of scissors for some reason.  Would also be great for camping, hiking, etc."
430,699,3,"This is not a cost effective solution, what you are buying here is luxury that you are going to catch a mouse and not have to physically touch it. The station is simple, a plastic container that holds a pre-loaded bait block. Its really Tupperware with a hold for a mouse to get in. They eat some of the bait, leave and are supposed to die elsewhere. I would possibly recommend getting these for use outdoors where it doesn't really matter where they pass on at, however I would not recommend these in your house because you don't know where the mouse is going to die, you could have to deal with a secondary issue of decomposing animals in your wall. Snap or electric traps really are what I would use in doors, this is a good outdoor solution."
89,897,2,"I understand the idea behind this design, but the execution is simply lacking.And the materials are flimsy and of very poor quality.I think this company might be better served by designing good products, using quality materials, and charging more.After all, a birdfeeder is a lifetime product, not a seasonal product.Pass."
58,328,5,"With almost 400 bulbs and perennials to plant I knew my spade would not hold up (or my back).  Popping this little guy on the end of my drill made the job a breeze.  Be careful to set your clutch low enough that you don't twist your wrist off should it hit a rock or hard spot.  400 holes and it still digs like it did on the very first hole.  This is one of my better purchases this year; really don't know why on earth I hand dug holes when for under 15 bucks I could have saved myself the trouble.  If you're a gardener, and don't have one -- buy this now.  Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner."
1226,72,4,"I use this for a very small lawn.  It starts like a breeze and cuts well.  It has plenty of power.  I got used to dragging the cord pretty easily and that is well worth the trade off for ease of use.  The main draw-back is that the handle is wider than the mower so prevents Getty close enough to fences, etc."
566,791,4,"It does perform as advertised, collects tons of leaves in no time.I have my own theory why grasses around perimeter of the tree always struggles.  Tress wither leaves for many reason, obviously to adapt itself for survival, but I also think by dropping leaves, it hampers the growth of other plant, conserving all nutrient from soil for itself.  Leaves on ground combined with moisture will form a firm barrier to sun light essentially need for photosynthesis process for all plant.  Also, by blocking Sun, it helps to retain constant moisture level, which encourages the growth of fungi and consequently, unwanted fungus will further blocks germination process of other plants.It's all simple process of evolution, come to think of it, but with so much fertilizer applied to trees every spring, they don't need be so greedy; trees and grasses can coexist and thrive, only trees don't seem to realize that, so it's the job of tree grower/planter to remove dead leaves to encourage the growth of the grass around the tree.  I understood this natural process, however, removing leaves, tons of them every week, with rake is pose to be a serious challenge, so it's been ignored all these years.Now, I can blow, vacuum and dump it back onto tree bed as a natural fertilizer.  Include shredder function only helps re-located dead leaves not so susceptible to be blown away by high winds, kept it neatly all winter long, where they need to be, underneath the tree, on its bed.While vacuuming, it picks up not only soft leaves but often other hard unbreakable materials; I can hear it. One with plastic impeller, I would not use it to vacuum, as no plastic parts is made to endure grinding small gravels and stones subject to rapidly spinning chamber.  All blowers seem to made in same factory, marked differently for each manufacturers; some blower selling at less than half the price of this one, but incorporates a plastic impeller.  It's well worth the money to buy more expensive blower incorporating aluminum impeller.I already returned this unit once, due to broken switch mechanism; I can only can hope it won't happen again as returning to manufacturer, dealing with unknown customer service, hopefully not like evil Nikon corporation selling known flawed productNikon D610 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)to boost its sales, who returns customer patronage with BIG and BIGGEST middle finger I've yet to experienced.  Only if the manufacturer can figure out ways to design and fabricate this handy tool more reliable which I can't see why it can't be done, this would have been perfect tool, in a quest of pleasantly appearing backyard garden, a sanctuary for most of homeowners."
350,39,2,Bought it in May of 2010.  Did not use it from November to April.  That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.
637,411,5,"Nothing fancy here.  Just a sturdy all brass nozzle for your hose.  It comes with a washer and it is easy to adjust the spray by turning the nozzle.  The spray is adjustable, accurate, and it can be turned completely off.  I leave mine on and turn the the handle of the spigot off to allow the hose to drain."
1346,933,1,"UPDATE 5/16/2014:  I'll leave my original review in tact below... but I am going to change this to one star ""cannot recommend"" because the feeder leaks like crazy.  I don't mean just a little leak, I mean red liquid all over the place kind of leak.  At first I thought the birds were just feeding like crazy and that's why the levels were going down... then I saw because it was sitting on a picnic table that the entire table was covered in red gooey sugar water and the feeder had a slow drip.  I'm surprised that Perky Pet would release something like this with a quality problem of this magnitude (it appears other reviewers have experienced this issue as well).  Can't recommend, sorry.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There are lots of great reviews for this feeder already so I'm not sure what I can add, but one thing that I didn't cross my mind when I ordered this large feeder... you have to have a LOT of hummers feeding to consume 30 oz of ""nectar"" before it spoils in the sunlight and heat.  Our hummers are very territorial and fight off others in ""their"" backyard so they can have all the flowers and of course this feeder to themselves.  That results in the nectar going down much more slowly than I would have predicted.As others have stated, this is a great design, with a wide mouth opening on the REAL GLASS (yay!!!) container (dishwasher safe, don't worry about a bottle brush as someone else suggested).  The ant moat seems to work and the bright red color attracts those hummers.  The nectar that comes with this is comically small amount... only 8 oz vs 30 oz capacity of the feeder.  You'll want to make your own with sugar and water (google the recipe) and without any food coloring which is bad for the birds (Amazon also sells clear nectar which is becoming the new norm now).One star off for being cheap with the initial supply of nectar, but overall an excellent feeder that seems design to perform and last.Hope this helps."
855,402,4,Handy mini-shovel for camping and backpacking.  Very good quality for a great price.  The back of the shovel also has a flat spot for pounding stakes.  Comes in a handy bag.  Would definitely purchase again.
1549,697,5,"I just received plant stand and if I must say so, Its so beautiful and sturdy I was very impressed!!!! very decorative not your ordinary plant stand love the design and its very sturdy"
1443,751,4,There are plenty of indepth reviews on Amazon so let me just cover a few things about mine. It is tricky to set. I am sure that this is just mine. It may have bent or whatever in delivery. I would have given up if I did not own a smaller one that works just fine. I needed to stretch one of the cables to get the doors to stay open/set. This is definately for home use so it is not as heavy as it could be. I will use mine in an attic space in the garage so it will not be exposed to the eliments. Very pleased with it.
584,530,5,"Received this item today.....charged the battery in about 30-40 min and took it out for a test run....Edged the front lawn by the 156 ft of sidewalk (both sides)that's over 300ft! and the driveway edges in no time and did a GREAT job.....then went out back to tackle the 9 brick and stone lined gardens....again did over 1/2 of the back before battery needed a quick recharge....went in to put battery on the charger and and registered product for the warranty on-line..had a coffee and battery was ready to finish...Did a great job...quite, powerful, clean and so light weight! Looks like gas trimmer will sit on rack most of the time now....this will do my over 1/2 acre yard so easy....Love it!"
42,432,4,"So we were super skeptical about this item... for a few reasons. 1 is that it's hard to prove it's working and 2 we have pets and didn't want them to get annoyed by this.The box says 7-14 days before ground rodents start to move away from the area- but we put it in a raised bed in the garden and got instant results. We had a pest that was eating our yummies. And it literally stopped coming. Maybe it's more powerful if just placed in a small bed because the power is amplified so much since it doesn't reach as far out as open ground (the product claims a radius of 95 feet).In any case we like it. 2 Caveats.1) it pulses every 36 seconds. It is audible close by. Kind of annoying when working in the garden, but easy enough to turn off with the power switch.2) the box reminds you to not try to drive it into the ground with a hammer since this would break the solar panels on top. It says to drive a pilot in with a steel rod, but probably not everyone has one with the right diameter handy. So be prepared to make a ""pilot hole"". The base is about an inch thick."
673,78,5,"This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!"
925,479,5,"I've had them all, cheap ($5) nozzles and an expensive ($90) nozzle (Griot's Garage). Given I've had the expensive nozzle for over 10 years now without a hicup lends strength to the adage; 'you get what you pay for'. But who in their right mind would pay $90 for a hose nozzle? Well, I did once but the good news now is that this $10 nozzle is the best I've ever used in this price range and unlike others in this price range, should last virtually forever (because there are no inherent design flaws).  Others have raved about the Gilmour nozzle and so I bought one only to find out that it breaks. Turns out it is made from three pieces of brass, two of which are press fit together; the inner core and the part that screws onto the end of the hose.  The outer jacket, the part that is supposed to turn to adjust the spray is the third piece.  When you torque the outer jacket down to shut off the flow, stress is induced on the press fit joint which eventually fails.  The press fit joint is now so loose, that I can't turn the outer jacket to adjust the flow without the core spinning at the joint.  That is, the core begins to turn and it leaks at the place where the two pieces are press fit together. Worse yet, I can't turn the jacket to shut off the flow. Only took 4 months of light use to happen.THIS nozzle is only two metal pieces! The outer jacket, that turns to adjust the spray and shut off the flow, and the inner core which is one piece of  machined brass all the way from the part that screws on to the hose to the center tip of the nozzle.  Internally there are a couple of replaceable 'O' rings in addition to the requisite washer where the nozzle screws onto the hose end.  The spray pattern is typical from wide mist to hard stream.Brass is soft, relatively speaking and I do not recommend leaving this nozzle outside in a presurized state after the outside temp falls below freezing.  (to help you appreciate the $90 nozzle, you could leave that thing anywhere, anytime of the year, and even bury it, only to dig it up and find that it works like new.  Combined with a good hose you could even leave the whole set up outside year round and forget about it.  Which I've done for over ten years.  Come spring thaw, it would be right as rain.)Gilmour makes some great products, like their Flexogen hose, but I'll stick to Dramm for the brass fittings.**UPDATE** 18 Dec 2012.I don't remember when I wrote this (I see it now, over two years ago) but it really was under $10 at that time....as of today it's 30% more?! The good news is that while the 'O' rings may need replacing, there's no reason the brass nozle shouldn't last a good many years."
630,934,4,I do a lot of container gardening so I purchase bagged soil and other products to fill grow bags and containers.A cubic foot of soil is not a small bag and I plan to mix it with other soil from my dirt pile to stretch both.The added time release fertilizer is beneficial whether I'm growing ornamental or vegetable plants.
786,563,4,"These are a great addition to my existing feeders.  I bought three.  Metal throughout.  The mesh it stout enough that I'm not worried about damaging it under normal use.  The paint job appears thick enough to last for many years.  The ball holds more seed than I thought:  It holds just as much as my full-size single tube Droll Yankees feeder.  I only use small to medium sized black oil sunflower seeds and have no problem with the ball losing seed.  (Note: this is not meant for use with small seed like ""mixed"" bird feed.  It'll just run right through the mesh.)  In fact, while filling it, I probably have only about 15 seeds that fall out before the ball is fully filled.  The included chain is about 10"" long and has an S hook on the end.One concern.  The lid snaps into place nicely, but a squirrel might be able to get it off if he tries (-1 star).  Instead of having it disappear in the grass below, I'm going to tie on a small tether.  I would have preferred to see a built-in metal tether of some sort to keep from losing the lid.  That way, I wouldn't have to find a pocket to put the lid in (or set in on the ground and lose it!) while I'm filling the ball.Update:  Yes, I've discovered that fox squirrels easily pop the lid off this thing and I almost stepped on it one time while refilling.  Going forward, a little string tether will be standard equipment on mine.Clinging birds appreciate the feeder and the bigger birds leave it alone.  I regularly get house finches, goldfinches, nuthatches, downy woodpeckers, and hairy woodpeckers, and chickadees.  I get near zero visits from any larger birds like cardinals, woodpeckers, or European starlings."
1187,98,4,"Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently, and I got repeat results. This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use. I'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and don't have to worry that it is way off. Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot, I wondered about that. As it turns out, all my areas are a bit acidic, so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true. Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling. What would bigger capsules cost?  Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds."
720,196,2,"The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy. They're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand. I just don't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests (fleas, ticks etc).I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away. The product's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time. I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence, it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that's it. This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions. It didn't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product."

121,758,1,"We've had this mouse trap in a problem mouse area at our front entryway for several weeks now. We know there are mice because because we see droppings--lots of them. So I knew the optimal location to place this mouse trap. Our hope was that we'd catch the little pests and then be able to safely and humanely release them in an empty field far from home.We followed the directions to a T. Setting the trap isn't difficult, though the directions call for precision when winding up the mechanism that is supposed to usher mice in. Unfortunately, we have quite a bit of evidence that mice have been around the trap. There are droppings around it and even on it. But nary a mouse has been caught. This is supposed to be a bait free trap, and we followed directions and didn't use any bait. As the mouse problem is in a location that doesn't actually have a food source, we don't want to add one. Likewise, we don't want to exacerbate our problem by attracting ants, so this baitless trap is completely ineffective at our house."
150,204,5,I have one outside on my deck and a second one in my garage.  They have each held up very nicely.  If you assemble them correctly (and trust me it's easy to NOT do it correctly) they are very solid.  The problem some are having is they are failing to assemble them correctly and sadly the design allows that to mistakenly happen.  Rubbermaid needs to do something to address this.  When it's put together wrong you'll definitely get people saying they don't hold up.
467,930,5,"I feel like I grew two giant claws when I use these leaf scoops.  They are the coolest gadgets.  Made of plastic -- yes, like those plastic sandbox toys -- but these are especially useful.  I spent a couple of days trimming trees in my yard, and with that came branches and leaves.  Before, I would rake up the leaves and then have to find a way to get the leaves into the bin.  Now, I just scoop them up with my new overgrown plastic hands.  It's so easy to use.  When I'm done, I can store them in the drawstring bag they came with.I can't find anything negative to say about these.  They're a great idea - very simple and clever.This product was provided for review by Best Leaf Scoops."
1666,729,3,"Not terribly offensive, and doesn't appear to harm anything I sprayed it on.  It's only been a few days though, so I can't really comment on that, nor on the efficacy of their proprietary SPOREX formulation.What I can say is that the pressure washer (thus, just plain water) does the lion's share of the work.  I call into question their claim that pre-soaking or pre-spraying isn't necessary.  Maybe not on materials you can just hammer-down on them with the pressure washer, but for wood, etc. the product didn't seem to do much more than plain high-pressure water.  Pre-soaking might have helped, but that doesn't abide the directions on the bottle.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences.At least it doesn't smell like Montana Solvent, and is certified to be greener than the stuff I've used in the past.  Some of the cleaners of olden days would about eat through your sneakers.  They would definitely kill vegetation whether you rinsed them down or not.  All in all, if I were doing another deck, coated in mildew and leaf stains, I think I would just cover my plants, dillute a little Clorox and cry 'Havoc'.This stuff seemed to be mostly about peace of mind, with not much cleaning.  My guess is there was moderate, incremental improvement in cleaning, but it wasn't astonishing.  I wish it were otherwise, but I can't endorse this product further than to say it might mildly improve your cleaning job, with the pressure washer still doing all the heavy lifting."
602,237,3,"According to the package, this is a slow working poison and would leave moles suffering for two days before they died.  (I might be willing to let a nasty rat suffer that long, if necessary and found no alternative, I will admit.)  But, it seems a cruel and inhumane for a cute little mole.  And we only have a mild issue with them.  We will seek another solution.Perhaps you have a mole issue rampant enough to justify that, and if so, I'll not certainly not judge you.  Just, well,&#34; there's the facts&#34; on this one.  I'm not willing to torture the little guys."
1519,352,5,"About as simple a device as one good imagine.  Only holds about 5 3&#34; chlorine tablets, but it does the job.  I use two of these in place of an in-line chlorinater and it keeps chlorine levels stable in a 20,000 gallon Florida pool."
835,838,3,"I have a small backyard garden and it can really be a chore to pull on a heavy hose and to keep it from crushing plants as I move around the garden to water.  So, yesterday I disconnected the heavy-duty rubber hose and connected this Lime Green expanding hose.  Even before turning on the water I could feel how light-weight it was.I turned on the water medium hard and the hose began to expand.  The flip switch at the end of the hose allowed me to adjust the spray somewhat but the water would not spray out of the hose with very much force.  Actually, that's alright because I don't want to blast my plants out of the ground.  The only thing that worries me about the hose is that with the flip switch in the ""off"" position the hose continued to fill up with water to the point I really thought it was going to burst.  So I would not advise anyone to expect this hose to contain the pressure like a heavy rubber hose can.It was much easier to walk around the garden and water the plants with this hose.  I just don't think this hose will last very long.  It doesn't appear to have long-lasting durability but I could be wrong about that.  Only time and usage will tell.  I will continue to use this hose for the rest of the season and into next season.  When I turned the water off the hose slowly contracted as the water pressure left it.  It was very easy to roll up and place on the hose stand.  I don't think it should be left outside because the lime green cover may not be able to handle intense sunshine and other weather effects.If it continues to function without breaking for the rest of the year I will upgrade it one star."
490,403,4,This is a pretty cool item for your backyard. It sets up in just a few minutes. You just have to put in and tighten 12 nuts and bolts. The 4 connecting sides go together very well.  You can have this set up and using it with 5-10 minutes. Pieces seem to be good quality just wish they were a little more solid feeling. It's not like they will break just wish they had a little more metal in them. The fire ring works great and does a great job of containing the fire. I would place on a brick or rock base for best job.
1468,388,5,"The Premium cover is a cover that is more durable the Staglar cover and more expansive than the Elgar cover. This cover is a new syth-meth material made up of Kevlar fibers which are extremely strong and durable (they are used for helmets and bullet proof vests). My dog Homer attempted to bite into it one day and he didn't even tear it. It is easy to wash (simply go down to a river and use vegetable soap), easy to use (simply put it on top of your grille) and even light weight (16ou). This can even be used as a blanket if you are stranded in the wilderness like I was one night, very warm."
18,637,4,"My garden has been completely organic for many years, with a special emphasis on safety for wild birds in the past five years. I raise dozens of varieties of flowers, and all of my own produce for six months of the years.It can be a challenge when neighbors are running a dandelion farm, and the wind blows just the right direction! Corn gluten-based weed controls have been a recent change, and one for the better. This Weed Prevention Plus is easy to apply, and safe in both flower and vegetable gardens. There is no danger of harm to pets or wildlife (of course you need to use common sense precautions to store any treatment out of the reach of children or pets), while weeds are withering.A full season's use will show whether this is effective throughout the growing months, not just early in spring."
1492,856,5,"I have never really wanted one of these blowers as I hate when the neighbors run there big gas models they roar. This is just like a loud hair dryer and not heavy at all. I like the variable power and the long lasting battery. I gave it a challenge today. This weekend we cut down tall grasses that have a black mulched hill in front of them. There was a lot of brown grass on the mulch and that made the area look messy. I got this out and set it on level 2 enough to blow the grass into the grass to rake up without moving the heavier mulch. Did the job of the 30 foot area in 6 min! I was delighted. No more running the lawn mower up and down the drive and sidewalk to clear grass clipping away a fast walk with this no sweat.I tried it on the highest level 6 on dirt and debris on the patio and it did a good job. It has a edge on the bottom to nudge things that may be stuck. I would say this is light to medium duty not gonna blow really thick wet mud and leaves. I love it is battery operated and not so loud and light weight. The older I get the more help I need to do the yard work. It also charges very quickly, I have not run it out all the way yet but I did 15 min and it was still going strong.Very pleased!"
17,874,5,"I was skeptical as to whether these would be any better than just using seeds. I did about half my garden with seeds and half using these pods. I didn't find the planting process to me much easier with the pods than seeds, but the results were different. The pods grew much fuller and faster than the seeds did. Next year I think I'll do all pods. The results are worth the higher price."
33,914,3,"Although we have always put up hummingbird feeders, and orioles s always come to these for the sugar water, we had never considered jelly feeders.  A friend also has one, of a different design than this, and he gets a LOT of species visiting besides orioles, including cardinals, house finches, thrashers, and hummingbirds.  Our experience has been similar in terms of the number of species.  His feeder is essentially a hanging dish, and he puts jelly in it every morning.  This one accepts a jar, and you just turn a handle on the bottom to feed more jelly -- at least that's the theory.  Maybe it's the brand of jelly we are using, but it isn't quite that easy.  The jelly isn't fluid enough and tends not to just run down, plus cleanup is not as easy as our friend's open style.  Of course we could just leave the jar off and put the jelly in each morning.  We are going to try a different brand of jelly next.  If we find one that works better, we will add on to this review."
1530,78,3,It seems to turn on at slightest motion and I think the frequent on-off cycles cause it to eat batteries.  I've gone through a 9v battery every 2-3 weeks so far using this.
769,833,5,I used this because I saw a garden snake in my yard. I hate any kind of snakes. This is safe for your pets and and your plants. That's the best part that you do not have to worry about your animals getting sick. Since using it. I have not seen anymore garden snakes at all.
1582,710,5,"UPDATE: I've had these for a long time now, and just wanted to add that I've actually given away my old corded hedge trimmer, corded blower, and gas weedwacker. These little Li-Ion tools are awesome. I use them at least once every week during the non-winter months and am very happy with their performance.--- --- ---Anyone who's skeptical of rechargeable tools is probably that way because of experiences with older Ni-Cd devices. I used to be the same way, but recently switched my Ni-Cd screwdriver for a Lithium Ion set -- the difference was incredible. I recently switched to a rechargeable Li-Ion vacuum and now, with this edger/hedger/blower set, I can almost completely retire my old lawn tools.I live in a medium-sized house in the suburbs, and I have a pretty small yard, so the lightweight tools in this kit are perfect for me. I'll review each separately because each has its pros and cons:TRIMMER: this is a pretty decent tool. The inertia-fed spool works very well. I have had no troubles with line feed. The RPMs are indeed very high and it tackles most weeds without a problem -- but it does get bogged down in heavy grasses (I have bahia growing in part of my backyard). The trimmer is lightweight enough so that women and kids can use it comfortably. A single charge lasts long enough to do my entire yard, and then some -- 15-20 minutes. I haven't used the edger function and don't intend to, as I don't believe this is heavy-duty enough to do a really neat job of it.BLOWER: this blower is strong enough to clear your driveway / walkway / street of moderate lawn trimmings and dust, yet is nice and quiet... nowhere near as bad as a plug-in or gas powered blower. However, with the lighter weight and quieter operation, you sacrifice a little power. This is still easily strong enough to get the job done in my lawn, but I wouldn't want to use it to blow leaves or scatter large chunks of matted grass clippings or dried dirt clumps. Think of this as just your lightweight post-mowing cleanup blower. A single charge will last you 15-20 minutes, more than enough time for me to blow out my garage, walkway, driveway, and the road.HEDGER: this thing is pretty amazing. For its size, and for being battery-powered, it is AMAZINGLY powerful. I think it might even out-power my plug-in hedger. I have false fig vines growing on the fence/wall around my backyard, and with this hedger I was able to knock it back with 2 charges (~10-15 minutes each). This is a powerful little unit and is sturdily built, yet is still lightweight and relatively comfortable to use, as hedgers go.BATTERIES: these are lightweight, solidly built, and firmly/smoothly click into place on any of the Black and Decker Li-Ion tools in this series. With all the tools in this kit, I'd expect to use both charges to get a whole job done (weed & blow, or trim all my hedges). Charging time is pretty long, but it's not a big deal; I just plug them in before I go to sleep, and they're done in the morning. If I have a lot of heavy lawn work to do, I'll just split it up... trim/blow one day, charge overnight, then hedge/blow the next. No big deal. Still, I wouldn't recommend this set to lawncare professionals unless you're planning on hauling around a case of batteries.CHARGERS: these are simple little plug-in chargers with LED indicators for battery charging status. Pretty standard.SUMMARY: while these won't replace your gas/plug-in tools for power, these lightweight little devices are super convenient and are perfect for lawn chores in a smaller house in the suburbs. The battery life is well balanced for the kinds of tasks I do, and I've found that, in most situations, they've completely replaced my gas/plug-in tools. I recommend these to anyone with a smaller yard -- I'm actually planning on picking up the tiller soon, so standby for a review on that one as I till up earth for a small autumn/winter garden."
851,842,4,"If you want to take plant cuttings and have them grow successfully, rooting hormone is a must.  A little goes a long way, so don't overdo the use.  I've tried several, and think that they all work well.  However, this is probably the best buy for the money that I have found."
934,497,5,"We're newbies to smoking and decided to purchase the Weber 721001.  It has worked out well for us.  Easy to use, clean, move around, everything!  The thermometer and side opening coat flap is a great feature.  We're able to fit a lot of items in the smoker at once (ex: a brisket on the bottom rack, and nuts and salt on the top rack).  So far we've smoked cornish hens, chicken, brisket, salt, and almonds.  All have turned out great.  Have not attempted to use this to ""cold smoke"" yet but would like to in the future to try cheeses."
1239,911,5,"I'm a woman, a mom, and the one who owns all the tools in our family... power or otherwise. My husband doesn't have a DIY bone in his body, and I'm too thrifty (ok cheap) to pay someone to do something I can do myself... even if it's something I pretty much hate. Yes, I admit it... I hate painting. However I also like freshly painted walls and change my decorating tastes frequently, so I've painted every room in each of our last 3 houses at least once, usually a couple times each. I've spilled a full gallon of paint on the carpet (thank goodness for owning carpet cleaners), I've ruined paint brushes by not washing them well enough, wasted lots of money on rollers because the thought of even trying to wash them was too daunting after being exhausted from painting rooms, I've cursed and complained and yet still continued to paint those walls.After trying this sprayer once all I thought to myself is "" YOU IDIOT!!!! WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO??? "", I did try another sprayer once... I believe it was a B&D; that was passed on to me from my stepdad... it was horrible, you had to thin out your paint, it clogged every 5 seconds, it was worse to wash out that 100 thick napped roller covers, I think I threw it away.... well if you've had an experience like that in the past don't let it cloud your sunny future with this sprayer. It's nothing like that.The directions are detailed and clear, parts are easy to figure out and put together. The longest part of the painting process is your prep, do a really good job with this since it's easier to keep paint off something than it is to remove it from something. I do recommend doing some tests before starting on your actual project so you get a feel for how the sprayer works, the different ways you can spray, etc.It's winter here now so I'm only able to use this indoors but for once I can't wait for the warmer weather so we can refinish our deck (a task I had been dreading when It hought I'd have to do each spindle by hand), I expect it to go so much faster and easier now... and I have some furniture I was thinking I'd have to use cans of spray paint to refinish that I now play to use this sprayer for instead!Buy one, you won't regret it!"
1240,525,5,"I do some volunteer work for a small animal shelter and sometimes we need a trap to catch a pesky kitten or small cat. This fits the situation perfectly.Having used older, hand-me-down garage sale traps, I was really pleased to see how easy this one was to use in both catch and release modes.We used it the other day to catch a semi-feral kitten that had been abandoned. Put in a small plate of tuna and left, came back a few hours later and voila--there was the kitten, an unhappy, hissing kitten, but now safe and getting used to humans. This is the smaller of the Havahart traps, so it isn't large enough for large cats, raccoons etc., but is great for squirrels, rabbits and small cats/kittens.The following are the aspects to the trap that I find I like:a) the rounded corners on the trap body. My older traps are square and hitting them with an arm or shin hurts as the sharp corner digs in. These are rounded corners and hurt a lot less.b) The easy set up for the bait.c) the easy catch and release door.Cons:None so far!"

62,180,5,"This is a pretty basic cedar bird feeder. So far it's lasted 6 months and hasn't broke, although I haven't had any issues with larger animals trying to get at it. Holds a fair amount of feed (enough to last weeks), and it looks better then a lot of the cheaper or overly unnatural looking feeders that are common. My only real complaint is the short/cheap rope it came with. Replaced that with a longer/more durable nylon rope I had and it's held up great!"
1266,370,5,I have owned them for approximately 2 years and they still look new even thought they have been in the weather the entire time.  Many other tools of lesser quality have already met their demise because of rust or by simply falling apart.  This is one instance where paying a little more for quality was well worth it.
860,917,4,"There's definitely a quirky kind of interesting that comes with having your houseplants pop up alerts on your phone saying they'd like some water.I wouldn't invest in a huge army of these to put in every pot in the house if you're a big plant keeper, but it's a neat device anyway. As it warms up, I expect to move it around the garden a few times to get a look at what it thinks of how much sun is available in the locations I have.For now, it's sitting with a plant and telling me how long it expects it to be before I need to water again, and it's also reminding me to fertilize.Sunlight is kind of a troublesome issue. It wants me to move the plant to where there's more, but the plant itself is getting more than the device is just because of how they're sitting relative to the window (and the leaves providing some shade). I also sort of wish there were a &#34;Winter&#34; mode that understood that my houseplants are probably going to have to survive with less sun for a little while, and that it might be good ease up on the fertilizer for the time being as well.I'd also really like a mode where you just put it somewhere, and then ask the database to tell you what types of plants would be likely to live in this spot happily.On the whole, it's neat to play with and there's definitely some utility to having one around. When my plants seem sickly, I'll now have a much better tool to help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. Up to now, I've tended to just end up having to buy a new plant."
1262,800,5,"Update 3/15/14 - Still using it. I am amazed what this thing can do for the price. No, it's not perfect and I have a feeling, based on some of the negative reviews, they may be trying to increase profits going with cheaper manufacturing, who knows... but you can't rent one for a weekend at this price. It's so cool to turn that pile of limbs that takes up so much space into a useful pile of colorful chips.Update 6/24/13 First, excellent customer service that took care of my issues. Second, the blades are double edged so that they can be used twice before sharpening. They don't stay sharp long, especially with dry stuff. Even an hour or so can dull the blade. If the material starts turning more towards sawdust then 1/2 inch chips it's time to turn or sharpen the blades.Update: 6/4/13 it happened to me this past weekend: a blade broke after two hours but that's still over 12 hours of actual use. It also damaged the aluminum housing (not exactly sure what it's called) that works with the chipping. It took a couple of calls but I did finally reach a customer service representitive. She is sending out a new housing under warranty but the blades are considered ""normal wear and tear"". I have put this through a lot of use and the blades have taken a beating so I feel this still makes this a great purchase for me. The warranty is two years so I have another year if anything else breaks.Update: 3/17/13 I was out again today chipping up winter debris and a few limbs from trimming. It still works like a charm. This included Maple, Pine, and Fur. I have literally ran this thing at least 10 hours of running time on at least 5 different occasions, creating at least five 30 gallon containers full of mulch. Do the math, this thing has more than paid for itself.Personally, I did not expect much from this knowing that any equipment in this price range is doom to failure. And I didn't expect much from the company to back it up just like the Lowes pressure washer I bought. But it has worked albeit with some patience and great care. To reiterate, it does not do leaves or green needles very well. But quarter to three quarter inch stock it does well and makes some great looking mulch.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Every year we have leftovers from pruning and raking up leaves. An old lawn mower has worked great for grinding up the leaves and small twigs but I've never resolved handling the larger limbs except having them hauled off with the yard waste. I was tempted to spend up to $1,000 but couldn't justify spending that much. So I searched out the lower end knowing you get what you pay for. But the Sun Joe Electric Wood Chipper/Shredder turned out to be a great buy!It literally will chip away limbs up to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Limbs that are 3/4 inch or less go right through. Anything larger has to be worked or they can get wedged and stop the blade. When you open the chipper to clear a clogged piece (I say when because you will) you will see how it works and it will give you a good idea how to turn the bigger limbs as you work them through.I also found it works great for cones up to an inch or so which is a bonus because they never really compost on their own and they add a nice red color to the mulch. I made a little chute out of an old detergent jug to make it easier to dump the cones in (duct taped it on for its first try...). For leaves a chute would be helpful too but I am going to continue to use my lawn mower for the leaves, you really have to work the leaves through. It does come with a plastic feed stick but mine broke along the seam after trying to push some clogged leaves. I will test the support/warranty on that but I found sticks work just as well if not better.A few tips: Limbs, especially over a quarter inch or so should be trimmed. They don't need to be straight but any Y branches or leftover nubs can cause it to bind. Anything over 3/4 inches will bind if you try to run it through. I found pausing a bit and turning the larger limbs helps keep them from binding.I did a pile of limbs about 4 x 2 x 2 feet in about half an hour from 1/4 inch to 1 1/2 . It is relatively loud; your neighbors will definitely know you are out doing something. But not as loud as a gas unit and doesn't smell. In fact, I love the smell of chipped fresh wood.The steel blades are bolted to a steel plate and shouldn't break off. They do work against an aluminum housing which seems pretty sturdy. I guess time will tell how long it and the motor will last. As far as assembly you only need to attach the wheels and stand. Easy to do and doesn't take long at all.This is a great unit if you prefer to make your own mulch and at a great price! Another toy for the garden."
115,388,5,I purchased the web kettle 22 1/2 charcoal grill and the grill did not come with no cover.  My smoker did my not my grill.  Good thing i had purchased an extra one and now goes well with my grill.  Side thought:  Why would weber not include one in the grill?
234,229,4,"I'm always cynical about these sort of products... especially the more natural varieties, but this one does work. I don't know how long it will work, it's worked now for about 5 days. I used the whole container so I would have to buy another to refresh it, 5lbs seems like a lot, but I have a lot of area to cover.It smells good, almost good enough to eat! :) It helped cover the cat spray smell that we have in the front yard from strays. I was very happy about that part.  I used it in a circle around a favorite pooping spot and so far, 3 days later and a light rain, it's still effective.The only thing wrong is that I'll probably need a 25lb container of it to cover all the areas that have been used by the neighborhood cats. Other that, since it works, I like it!"
1485,612,5,"No fan of cleaning, I'm all in favor of anything that makes the process faster and easier.  This lightweight (slightly over 1 1/2 pounds) Karcher wet vac does just that and the results are impressive.  I've used it to clean windows, mirrors, a storm door, a ceramic stove-top, a tiled shower and its doors and they all looked very much better for my (minimal) effort.  I have plenty of other projects in mind but I'm certainly encouraged by the success of my initial cleaning bout.After charging the internal lithium-ion battery, I grabbed a bottle of cleaning solution, sprayed the object in question and then squeegeed off the excess liquid.  Unless the surface is very dirty, the suction of the machine in conjunction with the action of the neoprene blades does most of the work so very little elbow grease is required.  Depending on the circumstances, certain areas might require another pass or two to get them really clean and streak-free.  Unlike paper towels and most cloths, it leaves no lint behind.  Clean-up is simple; just pull the plug on the receptacle and empty the used cleaning solution into the sink, wipe the blades and you're done.  It's a good idea to recharge the device so it's ready the next time you want to use it.  And believe me, there will be a next time."
1249,337,4,"I didn't realize when ordering this hummingbird feeder that the container itself was plastic. We have other Perky Pet hummingbird feeders but he jars are made of glass. The plastic is more difficult to lock into place with the plastic bottom so that it won't leak. It's a nice big feeder, holding 48 ounces of feeding solution. It is surprising how fast tiny hummingbirds go through the food but since it needs to be cleaned every two or three days in order for mold not to grow, we will probably fill it only halfway unless we get more Hummers.The feeder came unassembled, but it was pretty easy to snap the yellow flowers to the openings and screw the little perches to the bottom. The container is easy to clean but the bottom part requires a brush since it's difficult to remove the yellow flower covers and they will probably not last if we have to take them on and off all the time. It's a little bit difficult to secure the container to the bottom, having to twist it into the slots and secure it so that it doesn't leak. I am hoping it will last long-term. We use this type of ant barrier or ""ant moat"" that hangs between the hook and the feeder.Songbird Essentials SE620 Nectar Protector Bird Accessory. It works very well and keeps the feeder from being overrun with ants."
1347,135,2,"My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require."
49,924,4,"This is built well.  It is easy to put seed in.  I think it will last a long time.  I haven't had any squirrels get in it yet, but there doesn't seem to be a way to keep them out if they do want in.  But until that happens, I'll just keep using it as is.  But other than that potential problems, this is a fine feeder."
1054,265,4,"The 8 ply Flexogen (5/8"") is a staple for me, I have one on the backyard hose reel and it's lasted many years.  So I decided to get another for the front yard. Since I was ""cheap"" I opted for the 1/2"" size; it doesn't have the pressure behind it that the 5/8"" has, so next time, if I ever replace it, I'll get the larger size. The 1/2"" size is fine for washing the car, watering plants and hosing off the walks, etc., but that's about all, I don't think it would be the best for pressure washing."
1273,869,4,"I have severalContech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler, which I have been using for many years.  This is better because I can place it where I cannot run a hose.  It is supposed to be activated by heat, not just motion as the Scarecrow is.  There are still false sprays, but I don't think I am getting quite as many with this.  I still haven't figured out the exact placement and settings, but so far am very happy with this. I was missing a part, but one quick call to the company had a replacement immediately coming by FedEx, so I am very impressed with the customer service. The only things I don't like, and the reduction of one star, are that it is so expensive and I needs a better battery back-up so I am not defenseless on cloudy days.  I am happy to have it as part of my arsenal in keeping the deer from eating too much of my garden."

853,839,5,"In spite of the Julia Child's words about courage when flipping an omelet, I have never mastered the knack of fearlessly flinging an omelet into the air and catching it in the skillet. In spite of practicing with bread by the hour, I still balk when it is real semi-cooked eggs flying through the air. This, of course has doomed me to years of raggedy-edged omelets or fallen-apart-and-mashed-back-together monstrosities. They always taste okay, but the aesthetics leave just a bit to be desired. That is, until now. The nice folks at OXO Good Grips have solved another one of my small culinary flaws with a device that takes the aerial dynamics out of omelet flipping. This marvelous little Flip and Fold Omelet Turner glides right under the omelet allowing me to flip it in one piece and is cleverly shaped to allow one to lift one half over the other to make the final half-moon of fluffy eggs land perfectly on the plate.For all of you balky flippers out there, here is a perfect tool that lets the perfect omelet be perfect from pan to plate every time! I am so pleased with this item!!OXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turner, Clear"

It is fairly basic, not decorative but if you just need to put your pots of pretty flowers out on a rail it will do the job.Some reviewers complained of parts missing but mine was complete. It took me a minute to figure out that I need to turn a screw to loosen the parts and then tighten it up but that was easy enough. Seems to be a good product."
557,283,5,"July 19th. Finally ordered that second pack of these for the garage as stated later in the body of this review. Also threw out old traps bought in May, they were full. These are really a blessing they work so well! Now with summer here we are seeing more moths coming in the house when we open a door. I know now through the experience of using this extremely effective traps we will soon be moth free, most likely in less then 10 days.  I love that they trap the males so we don't have to worry about a whole new crop of moths. Bottom line this product is extremely effective, easy to use, and easy to place  and dispose of. As far as the reviews that say this product is not effective, I can only wonder if they are using it for the correct moth, because at our house these work even better than advertised.The portion of the below review is from first use of this product in May 2013:A dear person in our household, 2 years ago now, did not cover the bird food, we did not know this, until we discovered a partial bag crawling with worms, and then the light came on as to where all those darn little moths had been coming from.I was not even aware there was a trap for these kind of moths until I saw and ordered this one. They Work!  It has been about 2 weeks and we have noticed a huge difference already, and the traps are collecting moths about 2 per week, which may not sound like much, but I have not found any new  eggs laid.I cannot believe what a pest these moths are. We have been swatting them for 2 years and have not gotten ahead of them.  I ended up putting anything and everything in our freezer, all dry foods that interested them, what a pain.Then I would think we had the problem under control and would test my theory by putting a box of cereal in the pantry.  Pretty soon, we would see moths again. One day I totally took the whole pantry apart and got the surprise of my life, I had extra cleaning rags that I had not used in several years folded and put on the top shelf of the pantry. I pulled those down to clean behind them and inside the folded fabric there where dozens and dozens of eggs, some hatched and dried up, some fresh and yucky, gooey. So, all my efforts really had not mattered because they had a home ready made, how disgusting.I like the reviewers idea that suggested putting the 2 pheromone squares on a long fly paper trap, I am ordering another set of these for my garage, because we still have moths in the garage and the garage having much more square footage then the pantry, I think the fly trap having more sticky area may grab more moths quicker.From now on I will always have one or two of these in our home simply because the moth and larvae are so hard to find , catch and stop I am thinking an ounce of prevention in this case will definitely be worth a pound of cure."
136,83,1,"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the ""clean out"" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."
181,841,5,"This worked very well from the start.  Most weeds shriveled and died with 48 hours after I sprayed them (although the info on the Spectracide can indicates it could take longer). And then there were the dandelions. After a very heavy winter, tons of snow, we had so much moisture that the dandelions got a head start. I didn't assume the Foam edger would do much with them but it worked like a charm (more info about that below as I did tweak my usual method a bit for the dandelions).For all other weeds and grasses, I didn't have to adjust a thing. I sprayed them. I watched them die. I saw my garden bed have a very nicely defined line between the plants and my lawn. I do have a fence behind my plants and it is a MAJOR pain to try and tackle the unwanted weeds that sprout along that fence line so the Spectracide edger saved me time - and spared my  back.Now for those dandelions.....because the ground has been so moist and we've had so much rain, I picked a day when the ground was still moist  - but no rain was predicted - to tackle the dandelions. I simply grabbed and pulled as many as possible and this meant, of course, that their roots generally stayed in the ground. That's when I sprayed the weed killer into the remaining space.I tested it two ways on the dandelions: spraying them directly without trying to pull them up first - and then pulling up what I could, spraying the Spectracide onto the remaining root. Both methods worked well. Pulling up whatever I could before spraying worked better.The dandelions are now history."

715,915,5,"I've been gardening for many years and have used a number of different type of raised beds.  I bought some pre-made, which were nice but very expensive.  Then I tried to make some myself which was much less expensive but turned out pretty rough looking.These raised bed corners are the best of both worlds. They're very pretty, made of powder coated steel and you just fit your wood - any size 2&#34; lumber - right into the corners. It's really easy! You can also purchase separate Stake Holders if you want to add garden states for plant supports, or protective covers for bugs or frost.Makes making raised bed gardens easy and is highly recommended!"
916,167,4,"Initially I was going to give this product a 1 or 2 star review, but after observing a little more closely, clarity came. See below...I sprayed half of the container along a 50 ft backyard area which is only open on one side, the other two sides being neighbors privacy fences, and around some flower beds. The result 2 days later (and reason for threat of 1 star) was finding glistening deer droppings in my yard and a favorite plant on my deck eaten down to the nub. This was the first time I'd found deer droppings in my yard. My very first thought.... ""I've been trolled by a fricking deer!!"". Soon as I spray this stuff, they defecate in my yard and eat plants on my deck.After breathing a little (and resisting the urge to get a gun), I looked closer and realized that the deer (other than crossing over a barrier of spray to keep them out of my yard) had not eaten any plants near where I sprayed this product. In fact,  for the first time they went to my front yard and ate all my plants there.The obvious lesson learned here for me, spray everywhere I don't want them to eat and the spray does not act like a fence, keeping them out of areas.Still, I'm convinced I was trolled by a deer."
1442,698,4,"My father in law collects Hummingbird feeders so I have seen my share over the years.  The amazing thing is that the birds could care less if it is cheap plastic, or an expensive glass feeder they only want the nectar.  I decided to try and entice the birds to my own backyard and the Perky Pet feeder was successful.  Its been up for a month and not a day goes by that I dont see a hummingbird taking a sip out of it.  The feeder is very solid and well put together, so far no leaks.  It is also easy to clean.  The design is subtle and not over whelming.  All in all a nice feeder."

1147,716,4,"Tomcat has several types of Mouse Killer stations. The Mouse Killer II version, this one, is a small black box with a translucent plastic cover. It is pre-filled with bait (Bromethalin) and has an opening through which the mouse will walk toward the bait. The bait cannot be refilled and there is no need to ever touch the bait. This particular unit is child resistant but not pet resistant. There are two bait boxes contained in this particular package. The setup appears similar to the Mouse Killer package, which has a clear rather than translucent cover but is otherwise quite similar. The Mouse Killer packaging indicates that it is both child resistant and pet resistant as well. The Mouse Killer I packaging has a bigger bait station and you have to actually place the bait into the container."
1259,839,5,"Please refer to the two photos I uploaded. This thing is much bigger than my usual spatulas used for eggs and omelettes. This has a hard plastic handle which turns into a firmer but not rigid yellow blade and that is encased in a translucent soft material. It says it's good for up to 600F, and if you cook at such temperatures, well, good on ya. I keep things a lot more normal,  you don't want to blast eggs with a lot of heat unless you like watery eggs.Yet another brilliant Oxo designed kitchen tool. Imaginative -- I've never seen anything quite like this. The soft outboard part provides a big surface area for flipping fussy food. I'm thinking that this would work great with fish. I have a different really big pancake-flipping spatula from OxoOXO Good Grips Silicone Flexible Pancake Turnerwhich has a similar setup, there's a stiffer internal blade and that's encased in a softer-kinder-gentler material to ease your cooking over. The first Oxo product I remember was one of their chunky-handled vegetables peelers -- a massive improvement over those old nasty metal peelers. And they've kept at it, reinventing and refining everyday kitchen tools. Little things like having a decent spatula mean a lot over the long run, I mean, life is too short to use inferior tools. And this spatula is clearly superior to anything else I have in my kitchen arsenal.I do all the cooking for my small family and I enjoy having good tools. I *USE* them, they don't just sit there. So I'm pretty excited about this spatula. And I'm tickled that a company has people on the job thinking of things like this.Bottom line: While it looks a bit oversized, this spatula provides amazing control over just about liquid eggs, leaving you in control of an omelette. Remarkable improvement over a rectangular spatula. The thin translucent part slips under the edges and lifts them without tearing. Outstanding!This would make a really thoughtful gift for young people starting out on their own, or newlyweds setting up a household. One of those little things you don't really give a lot of thought to. But that end up being a perfect tool."
88,312,5,Hard to say too much about these simple little washers.  Replace the crap vinyl ones you usually get in hoses and attachements with good quality washers and fix those leaky joints.  I order several packs of these just to make sure I can find them when I want them.  It's the little things in life that you appreciate....
480,893,5,"A while ago, I purchased aFiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper, 18-inch, which can cut branches up to 1.5 inches with relative ease. Cutting thick branches with those loppers feels more like slicing through wet sugar cane or 1/2 inch thick branches than through 1.5 inches of solid wood. With those loppers, I was able to handle all but the thickest branches that I need to cut during a regular pruning. Thus I was looking forward to its larger cousin, the 9482 32-inch lopper.As much as I like its smaller cousin, this larger one is noticeably different in many ways. Although it's designed for branches that are only 1/2 inch larger in diameter, this pair of loppers is significantly larger and robust. It has much longer and better cushioned handles, and a larger jaw with precise blade alignment. It makes easy work out of everything the smaller pair did, and much more.The first thing I tried with it was to cut through an old branch from my last pruning session. It was too big for the smaller loppers and needed to be cut with a saw. Cutting through an old dead piece of wood like that is akin to cutting through a two inch wooden pole rather than through a live branch. At first I thought that there was no chance of getting the loppers to budge. But with enough force, I was able to cut completely through it with enough control that my son was able to hold the branch loosely as I did so. That's more of a task than I'd expect these to be put through in normal use, and I'm not in the best shape of my life.For regular branches, even those as thick as the jaws will allow, the amount of force needed is surprisingly low. The manufacturer claims that these give up to three times the cutting force of single pivot tools. In reality, they give three times the power of large, top quality single pivot tools with high quality blades. The ""three times"" statement is not a subjective claim, but an accurate one based on the laws of physics. Since work equals force times displacement, by designing the handles to move three times as far for the same amount of jaw movement as traditional loppers, you do the same amount of work with one third the force.There are only two down sides that I can think of for this product. One is that a lot more room is needed to open these up, so there's a potential for them to be unusable in tight spaces. I didn't encounter any real life situations where that happened, and since you are more likely to use these with trees than with tight shrubbery, that might not be a realistic concern.The other is price. I think these are well worth the money for something of this quality and size. But if your primary use is for branches that are 1.5 inches or less, with occasional two inch branches, it might make sense to get the smaller Fiskars and use a saw for those rare occasions.  But if you want something that cuts through those 1.5 inch branches like a knife through butter, you might still want these larger ones. A good strategy might be to get the smaller ones as a second cheaper pair for lighter work. Or you could buy the smaller ones first and then decide if you need the larger ones. But if you are looking specifically for something that cuts branches within this item's range, I would not hesitate to recommend it."
1217,98,4,I had been using this kit til I looked on amazon for refills and found none. I didn't want to buy another kit so I researched test strips. The test strips work the same and are waaay cheaper. I'm using my container that came in this kit but a cup to mix soil and water in would work just fine.

330,149,4,"QUICK SUMMARY:  This is the 2nd time I've bought this pole saw.  My first one broke after two years of use, but it was useful enough to me that I was willing to buy it a 2nd time.  Read my review to learn what NOT to do.  Recommended!My first Black and Decker pole saw broke when the screwhole threads inside the metal frame (these are the screwholes you use to make the chain taut) somehow got stripped after I tried tightening the screws once.  Apparently, you have to be CAREFUL not to overtighten these screws, or else you'll damage the screwhole threads, and the screws meant for tightening the chain won't tighten anymore, so your chain becomes too loose to use, so you can't use it anymore.  My lesson learned is your lesson learned!I also should admit, too, that I pushed this pole saw beyond its intended means.  By that, I mean that I was cutting big limbs off my front yard's black olive tree, the largest of which was probably about 10"" in diameter.  Yes, it's really intended to be used to cut much smaller branches and limbs, but I had to cut big limbs off my tree before hurricane season!What I like:- it's reasonably lightweight, though hard to use when you're stretching on a step ladder- no electric wires to accidentally cut, or that unplug from your saw!- the battery keeps a reasonably long charge- the chain is easy to tighten and replace- it's relatively inexpensiveWhat I don't like:- you have to manually oil the change every so often- you can overtighten the screws bringing permanent damage to your saw if you're not careful!- you have to assemble the wand fully to use the saw; I wish you could just plug-in the battery directly or almost directly into the saw so you more easily cut-up the fallen branches into smaller piecesFinal tip:  Take the time to read the manufacturer's advice on how to properly store and care for your battery.  I didn't, and my older saw's battery suffered because I didn't follow the charging instructions correctly.Recommended!"
414,821,4,"I think I have tried every Victor trap they have ever made.  I have never had a mouse in my house until I bought this one that is nestled in the woods.  I have chickens and other pets that unfortunately attract mice.  Amazon offered these to me to review but I must tell you I was very happy with their snap trap that I purchased recentlyhttp://www.amazon.com/Kness-Snap-Rat-Trap-Pack/dp/B0007QKECG/ref=sr_1_39?ie=UTF8&qid;=1360342044&sr;=8-39&keywords;=victor+mouse+trap+packwhen I used this one I had had an infestation (to me) of about 15 mice and this trap killed them in less that a week.Since the I noticed some droppings on my counter and since this was up for my review I decided to try it.  This model is a covered trap which I prefer since I hate to see the dead little critters.  It is capable of getting three mice at a time.  I do not like killing anything but the mice I had in my house came down and were seen running around the living room floor my dog caught one in his mouth and the situation was getting dangerous.  Mice carry all kinds of disease.  It was either them or us..Now I took this trap and used peanut butter as they instructed and placed it by the wall as noted. It has been there for a week I no longer have any more mice.I love these traps they work well the only problem with this newer one is that you have to use peanut butter, I usually place cheese in the little well of the others but this does not have a well you must put peanut butter on it.  I cannot have peanuts so I had to buy a jar of PB and is is sitting in my closet beckoning me to eat it but I can't it is a waste for me to use the PB but that is the only problem I have with this product."
311,851,2,"This large feeder is cute in a down-home, Mason jar kind of way.  I like that is is very easy to clean and fill.  (I hate those hard-to-clean feeders that get moldy in places that can't be reached, detrimental for the birds.)  I change the food often so it doesn't spoil in hot weather, so I fill the feeder only part way, but it hasn't leaked so far.Now for the negatives.  The birds don't seem to like it.  I've had it out long enough for the hummers to get used to it, but I see them fly to it and instead of eating out of it, fly to the other feeder I have, a glass one with a plastic base.  The food is changed at the same time, so it isn't a matter of one being fresher than the other.I had expected a high-quality metal, but I can't find any information about what kind of metal this one uses.  It feels a little cheap.  It has become a little splotchy inside where the feed is in constant contact with the metal.  Perhaps this isn't good for the birds or perhaps it gives the food an off taste - I just don't know.  At any rate, whether it is the taste of the food or the feel of the metal, the birds aren't using this one.  A hummer feeder that the hummers don't like, cute or not, is pretty useless to me.  Given the birds' reactions, I wouldn't get this one again."
1550,126,5,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring, along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it, this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles, while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here, it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous, but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad, and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days, so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure, but the birds sure like them."
268,825,5,These are some real solid hangers.

431,923,5,"I was a bit concerned how this would work given that the grille makes some of the seed harder to reach. However, the feeder has two benefits:1. It provides ample perching room for birds small or big and it's used for that with or without seed. Doves even used it as rain shelter :)2. Because, as the level of seed drops below the grille, it is a bit more difficult to get to the seeds birds tend to hang around more just trying to get to the food making for a better &#34;show&#34;I typically put about a cup of seed and that's enough for a day or two of fast followed by slow foraging."
898,717,5,"This is easy to assemble and even easier to kick back in. As I don't have two trees positioned in a way to hang this, the stand is heaven scent as well as sturdy and compact and portable.The 100% cotton cover is really comfortable on hot days and can be easily washed or even hosed down.When not in use, just disassemble and store in its case.This is much preferable to the rope hammock which started coming apart after I used it for two seasons and it is also nicer.This can easily accomodate two average sized people.

The only place I use it as a preventer is a small trench between the patio and the external brick wall.Even if Terro was not that good, the packaging design with the ""Shaker Bag"" is a fantastic and very useful design. Standard spreaders have two problems, accuracy and wind. Water based products are too much trouble and I am not sure of their potential.

If you have had luck with other traps, then this should be awesome!!I used the other product, the Milky Spore and it's just like it says.

727,461,1,"I'm confused why the micro bubbler needs to be staked.  I thought this was a microspray since it is staked, but the pattern reaches just a few inches from the emitter.  I guess if you were watching the spray as the system was on and you wanted the LOOK of the pattern being level, the stake would be useful.  Other than that, it seems unjustifiable expense.  I'm glad I only bought one pack.If you want a micro bubbler and don't need it staked, then I recommend the Nsstar set B00DW5GN0G.  A much better value (without a stake.)"

I agree my gardening abilities are subpar but most of that is attributable to little time and less interest. However, this year I am motivated to have a great garden.It is too early in my area to plant anything outside, so I experimented on cuttings from my mother's houseplants. The process is easy, clip, dip and plant. So far the results have been good. Both the ivy and the jade plant cuttings rooted within a few days and are doing well. The product container  is quite small but not much is used and importantly, it seems to work. Quick, easy and effective, this might just be how to turn my thumb green.

Now, it's like someone is flying them in!! Now boarding, all critters, on route to Sheri's for the summer!  So, I used this Havahart on my pretty shrubs etc and it's working perfectly!

1528,792,2,"this was a cute idea, and it came packaged quite securely, but the handle had a leak in it and all the water leaked out within seconds.  Not usuable in any way shape or form.  It would've been a great addition to our nature area in our backyard and I am sad it's not going to work."
1131,762,4,"My wife is an avid gardener.  We have huge tomato plants that are supported by the wire cages that are sold everywhere, and do a good job up to certain point.  Tomatoes need support when the fruit starts to mature because of the weight.  She has always used tie ties, like on the packaging for a loaf of bread---just a pain to put on and take off at the end of the season.  These plant clips just make the job so much easier and can be used season after season and they do not cut into the plant--really nice.  She also uses them in the flower garden for holding the stems up to show off the bloom, just attach to the support rod or stick. So simple to use, place the clip around the stem and the support and snap closed; easy to move as the stems get longer.  If grandma only could have got her hands on these, she used string; but, that was a long time ago and these had not been born yet.  If you, like my wife spend a lot of time in the yard gardening I'm sure you would find these very useful too."
252,904,4,"The main differences between this and most other flower food is a higher level of nitrate nitrogen and a good dose of calcium.The nitrate nitrogen makes the fertilizer useful in prolonged cold weather (below 45 degrees), when pansies are still active but won't take up ammoniacal nitrogen. Too much ammoniacal nitrogen may also cause spindly growth during warm weather, so this formula balances the two, with a little over half the immediately available nitrogen in the nitrate form. It also includes slow release nitrogen in the form of feather, meat and bone meal.Some problems with pansy greenhouse plants have been traced to calcium deficiency. Most soils already have enough, but some growth mediums (i.e. the material the plants are typically grown and sold in), which rely on liquid fertilizers, don't. Curiously, this product doesn't include magnesium, which should also be present in soil in a certain balance with calcium to avoid boron deficiency, another particular issue with pansies.The guaranteed analysis for this 10-7-7 NPK product is 10% total nitrogen (N), including 3% ammoniacal N, 3.4% nitrate N, and 3.6% insoluble N; 7% phosphate (which gives the P number); 7% potash (the K number); 5% calcium, 4.5% of it soluble; 2.5% combined sulfur; 1% soluble iron; 0.3% soluble manganese.This 4-pound bag covers roughly 150 square feet at the recommended amount. Reapplication is recommended every 4-6 weeks.Application is easy, the granules are heavy enough not to blow away before you can lightly work them into the soil and water them.By the way, this fertilizer *is* safe for food production (contrary to what one review implies), but since it isn't organic, it isn't suitable for the production of *organic* food.The Lebanon in the manufacturer's name comes from Lebanon, Pennsylvania."
435,713,4,"I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement.  My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I have tried a number of traps and poisons to deal with the problem. It is hard to know how well a trap or poison is working at any given moment because I tend to get mice at certain times of the year like the colder months or when a family of mice have decided to live in my shed or garage. During a bad winter in New Jersey I went through a lot of mice poison and caught a number of mice. I have seen little activity this spring which has been mild. Different brands of mice poison seem to work better at different times.The Tomcat mouse killer bait station is nice because it is covered. It is refillable so you need to wear gloves and touch the poison blocks and place them in the bait station. The trap is average size.  It says it is safe from the tampering of dogs and children and looks like it would be hard to get into. While the trap may be safe the bait itself must be stored in a safe place out of the reach of children or pets.  In the short time I have had this I have seen a few nibbles. I have used this type of Tomcat mouse poison before and it has been eaten by mice.You need to touch the poison to load this bait station and while it says the station is safe from the tapering of children or dogs the remaining bait blocks are not so you have to store them in a safe place."

182,167,4,"We live in the woods, deep in the woods and the deer like to play in our yard and snack on our shrubs and plants. So every year, my holly bushes get eaten back to nothing and the rhododendron get chewed to bits, even though they are right at the front door. I've often looked out my window to see the deer right below it snacking away and staring at me. Needless to say, our landscaping is rather scrubby.Deer Off has worked so far. I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked. The container comes with a battery powered pump. The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work. The spray nozzle is slow and doesn't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well. But eventually it all worked.So I give the solution 5 stars and 3 stars for the dispenser. The solution is more important so I think buying it wins out."

We have a few small pots on our back patio and these mini-planters with seeds have started to grow already.  The kids love watching them take off.  It will be a while before we have anything big enough to eat, but it has certainly been a major hit so far with the limited space we have around our house., for"
496,145,5,"I waited more than a year to write this review, because I really wanted to give this feeder a workout.I've been feeding birds for more than 30 years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't, and this feeder does what it says it will.  It's completely squirrel-proof!I've had problems in the past, with squirrels decimating my feeders:  emptying them out completely, chewing them up, and worst of all, keeping the birds away with their aggression.It's great if you have problems with squirrels or even larger birds:  you can adjust the closing of the feeder to accomodate the weight of your desired birds.Another plus is that it's dishwasher-safe!Having said all that, the only negative is that only so many birds can feed at a time if they're sitting on the perch.  But, for those birds that take a seed and then fly away to eat it (chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, woodpeckers) it's great.  If some birds are ""hogging"" the feeder, you can remove the perch altogether.Highly recommended (I just wish it was less expensive!)"
430,239,4,"I had the chance to try these out. I have had a number of traps lately and comparing them all together these are one of my favorites. i like the simplicty of the old fashioned trap with the spring bar. There is little room to fail, it either works or it doesn't. Other traps I've tried include some that spin, some that are reusable and don't kill the critter, and still others that caught the mouse from the top in a weird way that never really worked right.These traps are simple, they are NOT as sensitive as some of the other basic traps but they are still sensitive enough. If you put loose bait on the trap you might not get your critter. I would recommend putting peanut butter as others have suggested as it will &#34;stick&#34; to the trap and require a little more movement of the trap plate to get it to trigger.These traps work, they are cheaper and reusable then the fancy &#34;spin&#34; style traps and frankly these are all you need. I have them set out around the garage."
54,780,3,"It's a nice little container that's stylish and includes a little lid not pictured. It holds a standard garden hose nicely.

I don't know that I would put a real plant in it though, it's kind of shallow for that.  I think it's very attractive and will go with multiple types of exterior."
20,874,3,"I love to garden and am always willing to try new things.  In the garden world, there are always new ways to market tools and planting devices.The concept of this package is interesting.  Ideally I'd prefer just a few vegetables to grow a bigger yield of one item.  And then there are climate variations.  I live in southern Arizona.  The monsoon is in heavy swing and gardeners usually plant just days before the first rains in mid June.  Some of these vegetables are cooler weather crops, others require some shade in our extreme sun.This is an expensive starter kit, but Miracle-Gro does work.  The one problem I had was having the seeds pop out of the soil after a heavy rain.I'll update this review in 30 days."

Time will tell if the coating will stand up to heavy use without chipping off but I'll post a follow up review at the end of the season.  So far, I'm impressed.  I also like that it has a long, hardwood handle.  Most gardening tools made today seem very cheap but this looks to be a quality tool."

No more trying to lightly wedge the curved trigger bar into the slot on the trip pallet.  This one comes with a sliding handle that makes it super easy and when it has been triggered, it is locked down good.  No escape.  I was able to trap a squirrel the first night it was out.  Hopefully he doesn't find his way back after setting him free at a neighboring lake.  I couldn't be more happy with it.Highly recommended."

358,349,4,"We bought 100's of bulbs last winter thinking we would get to plant them before winter hit.  However, as was the case across most of the country, winter hit hard and lasted forever.  Beginning in October the temperatures stayed in the 30's and lower and only finally got above freezing a few days in March, 2014.I was worried the bulbs might not be good any longer if I waited until this fall to plant them, so we went outside yesterday (May 1, 2014) and started the planting.  I expected it to take hours to plant all these bulbs, but with the Yard Butler it was so quick and easy.  We were done in less than 2 hours including a couple of breaks, and now I just hope the bulbs will bloom next spring.  I just won't know how successful we were until then.As far as the Roto Planter is concerned it is a super helpful garden tool.  Be sure you have a drill that will accommodate 3/8"" bits...a 1/4"" drill (which is most common) will not work.EDIT:  May 19, 2014We bought some annuals to plant in our flower garden this past weekend, petunias, marigolds, impatiens, and verbena, and because the yard butler had helped plant all the bulbs so quickly I purchased flats of 48 of each of those varieties.  Hoping this would work as well as the bulbs we went out on a Saturday morning at 9AM to begin planting 196 flowers.  Normally this would be a several hour job.  Between digging a hole with a trowel, breaking the plants apart from their containers of 4/tray, planting each one, and filling the holes with miracle-gro garden soil to replace what was displaced by the yard butler, it took us (two of us) less than 1 1/2 hours to do it all.  One of us used the butler, the other followed with the plants and covering their new home with good soil.  Now, we will wait and see one absolutely gorgeous garden in a few weeks!This is an essential garden tool!"

536,880,5,"My first impression of this hose was that it looked more like a kid's toy than a garden maintenance tool, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's bright purple and resembles a toy snake if you aren't using it.  Attach it to an outdoor water outlet, though and turn it on, and it will likely surprise you. As it fills with water, the hose firms up and expands, and eventually, reach 50 feet.  Applying pressure at the hose's mouth will let you control the force of the water flow and even temporarily turn the water off (at least that's what happened when I experimented). The length was such that I was easily able to water all my backyard flowers and plants.I just received and started using the hose, so it remains to be seen how hardy it is, but so far I am satisfied."
1372,418,5,"F.Y.I  A LOT OF THE BAD REVIEWS ARE ON THE OLDER MODEL SMOKER. THIS IS THE NEWER MODEL AND YOU CAN BUY AND REPLACE THE HEATING ELEMENT IF IT EVER BURNT OUT.this masterbuilt smoker works great for me even when using a extension cord. but if using one it be must be able to handle the power the smoker requires. I used a regular outdoor cord and it took my smoker forever to heat up. I ended up buying a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends,25-Feet) bought on amazon and smoker heated up quick & worked it the way it was meant to work. this smoker is very easy to use and puts out good smoke although it does not put out smoke with temps under 200F not sure if that's because I use wet chips I haven't tried using dry chips yet. I'm very happy with this smoker so far I've only smoked ribs & chicken and turned out very good. there has been a lot of reviews about getting parts for this smoker & dealing with Masterbuilt customer service. I haven't dealt with C/S so I don't know about that as far as finding parts I found a place on the internet called APPLIANCE FACTORY PARTS that sells parts for model# 20070106 & model# 200709010 also I did not buy this smoker from Amazon got mine at WM but thought I would write a review anyway and I payed the same price that amazon sells it for but it took 2 weeks to get it from them.6 MONTH UPDATE 11/23/12well after 6 months and 200+ hours of smoking time, this smoker still works great. I've smoked snacking sticks, summer sausage, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, Canadian bacon,turkey, and venison and all turned out great. I never had any problems with the heating element, digital timer, or any other part of this smoker. as far as smoking/cooking I've never set the temp higher then 225 F when smoking, after a few hours of smoke I'll drop the temp down to 200 to 210 F to finish cooking, and use a wireless digital meat thermometer. I've kept mine outside all summer/fall and haven't noticed any signs of rust or any other signs of damage but I have a good cover for it. but I'll keep in the garage/shed over the winter. the cover I bought for this smoker is the Veranda Square 30"" Smoker Cover for Price: $29.00 bought on amazon its a great cover. love this smoker. just remember keep it clean buy a water proof cover, if kept outside. if going to use a extension cord I recommend this one. Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends, 25-Feet. I will UPDATE in another 6 months.1 1/2 YEAR UPDATEwell after 1 1/2 years of use about 450+ hours this smoker still works great never had any problems at all with it. I did buy the cold smoker adapter for it and that works GREAT, I don't put chips in the main smoker anymore. the cold smoker adapter holds a lot more chips about three good handfuls and produces longer and better smoke then just using chips in the main smoker. you can run the main smoker and the cold smoker at the same time even when using a extension cord in fact I can run the main smoker, cold smoker and my Weber rotisserie at the same time without any problems. the extension I use is a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends 25-Feet) and a ( yellow jacket 2' three plug adapter. again if you plan on keeping it outside make sure you buy a good waterproof cover the black masterbuilt cover is worthless. also I would not keep it outside in freezing weather the cold could damage the digital timer / temp gauge. I keep mine in the basement in the winter months when not in use and never had any smoke smells coming from it."

111,481,2,"I am still looking for the ultimate verminator.  My neighborhood is adjacent to an open field,which is infested with thousands of field mice.  Under normal circumstances, the mice stay in theirown environment.  However, from time to time, we get overrun with the filthy critters.  This winterwas especially bad.There are locations where the traditional Victor neck-breaker cannot be used; small kids and dogsmight blunder into them.  I first evaluated the Victor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trap and found itwoefully inadequate.  The mice could not get to the bait easily; they seemed to be confounded bythe plastic ""house"" enclosure.This electrocution device appeared to be an economical solution.  In actual use, though, the oldVictor snap-trap could not be beaten.  The first week's body count was 7 on neck breakers, oneelectrocuted.  The next week saw 3 killed by traditional traps with none electrocuted.  The invasionhas finally dissipated, and Victors' traditional traps saved the day.This electronic trap is not at all intuitive.  Baiting it can be confusing and could cause anelectrical short.  Then, there is a single entry point for the vermin.  I have sketched in threesuggested entry sites for Victor engineers to consider.  Additionally, I bend fuzzy pipe cleanersand suspend them from the perforated end piece of the trap.  The fuzzy wire enables me to slatherpeanut butter bait on the suspended wire.The mice have to see or smell the bait first, and they require easy access to the electrocutionplates.  The old-fashioned trap had walk-right-in visibility and direct access to mouse heaven.The bait was never hidden by an unnecessary ""house"" of plastic.I think the only good mouse is a dead one.  They are filthy vermin and not at all cute.  Sorry,Mickey, but I am a Donald Duck fan.  Someone should tell Victor to stop hiding the bait and useall that plastic to entice vermin into the electrocution zones.I am really disappointed in this unit.  Yes, it works.  The old-fashioned stuff works BETTER!Another bit of heresy:  I stumbled across an interesting bait:  WD-40(!?!?)  I saw two mice eagerlysniffing about a can of the stuff in my patio.  I decided to saturate a piece of cardboard with WD-40and inserted it into a Victor neck-breaker.  The next morning resulted in a dead mouse.  WD-40 works!Few people realize that WD-40 is little more than perfumed FISH OIL.If you are stuck with using the electrocution method, spray WD-40 at the single entry port andsaturate a pipe cleaner (with peanut butter or more WD-40) suspended from the perforated end of thetrap.  If pipe cleaners are difficult to find, use a bent paper clip and secure a bit of cardboardto it.  Otherwise, WD-40 would surely cause an electrical short if it reaches the floor electrocutionplates.  Some people can't stand its odor, while others aren't fazed. Mice love it - isn't that thepoint?The world will not be beating a path to Victor's door; they have not perfected the mouse trap; Victorhas confounded mice with a trap that doesn't look like a trap, has no easy access to bait, much lessadequate instructions to attract mice.  There is no such thing as Einstein Mickey Mouse or Frank LloydWright Mickey Mouse, which this trap supposedly attracts.  Be patient - a suicidal mouse will eventuallyblunder onto the electrocution surface and get its nuts fried."

As soon as the weather gets warmer I'll take the pots outside for some natural sun and soon I'll be drinking spearmint and peppermint sweet tea suing my own plants.

652,843,5,"If you have ever watched Billy the Exterminator, you have seen him and his brother get up close and personal with many wasp nests. Unless you like getting stung like a pin cushion and swelling up like Violet Beauregarde, you really want to be as far away as possible. But since they have yet to create a Drone Delivery system for wasp nests, this is you next best option.You also need to use it correctly, short bursts will make it last longer. One long stream will exhaust the pressure from the can too fast. It has a very fast knockdown and kill and I especially love the trigger because it provides much better control when aiming at those wasps aiming at you. It also has a residual effect for the wasps that are away when you kill the nest. Personally I would advise leaving the now poisoned nest there for a day or two before you knock it down to get the latecomers. And of course it also will work on other insects, but unless you are infested with spiders, I would use a regular insecticide for them.Also worth mentioning, there are two types of wasp sprays on the market, basic spray and non-conductive foam. If you nest is anywhere near electricity, use the non-conductive foam spray instead of this type."

20,297,5,"I don't understand how anyone has trouble getting this trap to work. I followed the directions by filling this up to the water line with warm water, placed it in a warm, quiet place and within a few minutes had two flies swimming in the concoction. A few hours later and I have quite a few more. This one is flying off our back porch and only gets early morning sunlight.I have a few others hanging in the same general area as this one, all made by Rescue. The concept is the same: a disposable bag with water-activated fecal material is what lures the flies into the bag via several one-way entrances.This bag doesn't smell as bad as the Rescue brand though. The outside is decorated with green leaves and the dead flies are visible. At least on the Rescue brand one doesn't see the dead flies. Regardless, the one I have flying above our north-facing back porch is working great on its first day of use. We won't be getting the onslaught of flies we had last June because this year we started setting up our fly traps a little earlier."

Additionally the nectar does easily stay preserved for weeks in this unit compared to the week or two max that sugar water would last in my other hummingbird feeder.  Evaporation also seems slighter with this feeder.  The only baffling thing is I rarely see a hummingbird on this feeder, whereas my cheap red plastic one had them constantly the last few years.  I'm not sure what to attribute that to - weather? feeder style? nectar vs sugar?"
1624,145,5,"I love Brome feeders. This is my third one. I like this one because it's well made and the materials are good. The lid, base and cardinal perching ring are made of metal. This means the squirrels are less likely to damage it. The weight-activated shroud pulls down under the weight of a squirrel so the shroud covers the feeding ports. The shroud can be adjusted to keep larger birds out, too.Cardinals do not like to turn their heads to eat, so they don't like feeders with stick perches. If you want cardinals at your feeder, you NEED the cardinal perch ring. (Cardinals are also very timid/nervous. You'll attract more cardinals if you place your feeder near shrubbery or evergreen trees. The tree or shrubbery is necessary because the cardinals want to sit in the shrubbery or evergreen tree, waiting and watching to make sure it's safe to go to the feeder. Cardinals love hemlock trees, by the way.) If cardinals don't interest you, you can buy the same feeder WITHOUT the perch ring for a little less. It's called ""Squirrel Buster Classic"".I almost didn't buy this feeder because it's so tall. I thought I'd have to hang it extra high to keep squirrels from climbing or jumping onto it from below. Silly me. If squirrels attack from the ground or climb up the pole and grab the ring or shroud, the shroud will close the ports.If a squirrel gets on top of the feeder and stretches his front feet down toward the ports, he can't get to the seeds because the feeder is too tall for the squirrel to reach the ports! Brilliant.Squirrels are unable to get the lid off, so they cannot get to the seed from the top of the tube. The only way squirrels can get to the seed is to chew through the tube. I hope they'll get frustrated enough to leave the feeder alone before they think of chewing through the tube.I can't speak to the durability of this feeder because I've only had it for a week. But I can say that my other Brome feeders have held up very well. Excellent feeder."

I primed, I changed batteries, and I would have even attached the twist on wand had I been provided one.  To put it quite simply, the well-meaning sprayer was a total dud.  I'd suggest that if you do need this product (and I do) that you invest in a reliableSolo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayerand forget about the innovative, but flawed sprayer.The ""Deer Off"" itself does work and there are several positive things to think about.++  You can safely use it around children an pets, but take note that you will want to keep it out of reach as you would any product.  Think pepper here.++  It has USDA approval to use in organic gardens.++  I could not smell odor once sprayed, but it is offensive to those critters you don't want chomping on your plants.++ Deer Off will repel deer, squirrels, and rabbits.CONS:-- Unreliable, flawed motorized sprayer--  The critters may head for your neighbor's gardens (this can be either a pro or a con, depending on how you perceive it).--  It's difficult to use this product in larger gardens due to the limitations of the spray.--  If you experience heavy rains, application should be repeated.I'm conflicted in applying a star rating for this product.  I'd give it five stars had the motorized power sprayer actually worked because application of the Deer Off should have been simple.  On the other hand, Deer Off appears to be working using an alternate sprayer.  The squirrels are leaving the sunflowers alone and the deer aren't chomping them off at the stems.  And so, this entire packet didn't live up to what it promised and I'm having to compromise at three stars.  It would have been better simply to send the Deer Off sans the dud of a sprayer and include a hand-held one."
1187,61,5,"1. It is taller than the cheapos and has more chimney effect so it works better.2. Is made of heavier gauge steel than the cheapos and lasts longer. I just  leave mine outside. It takes years to rust through. My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3. It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat, so the thicker the metal, the longer it will last.4. The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals, their moisture content, humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5. If the coals fail to catch, then repeat the process. Do not pour lighter fluid into it. Doo.6. I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out. I do not use the tipping handle thing so I don't need gloves.7. One of the features of a Weber, and some other grills, is that after you finish grilling, you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time. So, pile the newly lit coals over the old ones. This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8. Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill. Use this feature. Pour your coals into this area, sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion. Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish. This gives the best result.9. Weber stuff seems to be the best, at least in its price range, and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10. Many stores are now just stocking a cheap Chinese brand of chimney. Thin, small, short and just ca ca in general. Don't encourage the b******s, get the real thing._____________________________These are great. The one I reviewed is still good after hundreds of uses.FIRE-STARTING UDATE: sprinkle a little olive oil, or other cooking oil, on the balled-up newspaper. It makes for a hotter and longer-lasting fire that so far has started my charcoal the first time, every time. I also shred the paper and then ball it up. Takes a couple of pages. Don't use the slick paper advertising inserts."
235,22,3,I like the product being glass and so do the hummers. It would be nice to see PP improve the rim or perch to a more durable one as it becomes flemsy and easily breaks away from the base over time. Also the the yellow ports should be changed to red so as to discourage bees.
585,504,4,"I don't know if this means I don't have any more mice or that this trap doesn't work.  I assume the former, because this trap seems very good in theory.I've read other reviews where the batteries died quickly and the indicator light died after a few days.  I've had this trap turned on for almost two weeks and the light still shows that it's working.This trap is easy to set and very simple to check and clean.  I just haven't caught any critters yet.The design is interesting.  You open the top hatch and fill the bait section with peanut butter and then close it back up.  With fresh batteries installed, turn the device on and set it someplace where you expect mice to frequent.  There are two little staircases where the mice can climb up into the device.  Then the mice walk through a little maze that looks like a miniature carnival fun-house.  The floor of this maze has metal plates that zap the mouse on contact.  Then a revolving scooper thing brushes the little corpse into the lower collector tray.  The tray opens easily from the side so you can see if you caught anything.  The tray supposedly holds up to ten victims.In theory the whole thing makes sense.  I'll just keep moving it around and see what happens."
997,878,5,"This is my second Rat Zapper Ultra.  The first one I bought in 2008 and it successfully killed dozens of mice for 4 years before it started flashing without a mouse being caught (often, the bait would still be in the trap).  This was probably somewhat to blame on me because I only cleaned it once or twice in the 4 years I had it, and you could see where mouse pee had damaged and corroded the electric plate inside.So, with this new Rat Zapper Ultra, after each kill I am removing the batteries and wiping out the inside of the trap to keep mouse pee from ruining it.  So far, so good.  I love it just as much as my old one, it works very well and it's a trap I can use without being squeamish.  The batteries will kill a lot of mice before needing to be replaced."
36,672,5,But do recommend purchasing from Amazon* as best price so far .  - Now to figure out how to make an Elastic [pix] strap for even better comfort .. 73 yrs old and do tend to make things as easy as possible now - Lighter than the one used [neighbors'] 4 past 2 years as do both yards. Lighter and a little more compact and the two battery system will help to finish 2 yards in one day.  Only did one today - 2nd one tomorrow only because it is cool and windy.ADVICE: for easy assembly - see review by Ali Julia - with these tips and the pix and a whole lot of 'King's English' able to get together within half hour - then Used this am for a bit longer - maybe 10 minutes more power than the older B&D; model took before battery winds down. Always trim before mowing - easier on the mowing patterns then.
1466,255,5,"This does work.  It's an easy product to use and the important thing is that it does work.  For now, the problem is gone and when it returns, I'll just use more of this."
555,838,2,"I love how this is small and light. I HATE large, heavy, bulky hoses with every fiber of my being. With that said, the flow on this hose isn't that great and the connectors suck.

1258,374,5,I wanted something that could hold lava rock directly below the heating element of my Char-Broil Bistro. It took some twisting and patience but I finally got it to fit tand put the lava rock from my yard on it.
1619,888,5,"The Ravenna fire pit cover is made of substantial material which looks like treated canvas or cordura.  It has a water[proof pvc backing, drawstring closure and handle to make handling it easier.  The finish levels very high, with no loose seams or threads. It is about as nicely made a cover as I have seen.  I suspect that had we been able to find something like this for our barbeque it would have lasted a lot longer than it did.  Sure to extend the useful life of  your fire pit. (maybe I should look tosee if they have something which would fit our barbeque!) as covers go, this is well done."
1142,922,4,"It is difficult to gauge how well this works since we just got an ALOT of rain and my roses are popping already.  I will say that the ingredients are mainly Nitrogen 9%, Phosphate 18%, Potash 9%, and sulphur 20%.  I will say that roses additionally love calcium which is not present here (I usually grind up egg shells with a coffee grinder into a powder and spread them at the base).  I also spread used coffee grounds as well for the nitrogen.  Whether or not this gives my roses an extra umph is hard to say.  I will say, however, that this is extremely easy to use.  I love the shaker which makes it easy to spread in my garden.  I've also used it in some of my potted plants as well.  It is quick and easy. and less labor intensive then the crystal formula you attach to your hose.  So, 4 stars for being a good source of most nutrients and ease of use."
1103,821,5,"Mice don't stand a chance when it comes to the Victor Tri-Kill mouse trap. This trap is like three traps in one, with the bait in the center. Peanut butter actually works great with this trap, mice are attracted to it, and it sticks to the center of the trap. The trap is reusable, and is very easy to reset without worrying about getting fingers snapped. Because of the design, it easy to place against a wall and catch mice coming from any direction. The fact that it can catch up to three mice overnight is a huge bonus, and eliminates the need to worry about setting out multiple traps separately. The design is also much more visually appealing than the standard mouse trap design."
1651,463,5,"I like this one, it's easy to clean, fill and hang.  The bug moat works too."
1049,914,5,"Who doesn't love watching orioles in their yard?  I've always wanted a jelly feeder to attract them, but didn't want the kind with little cups that constantly need refilling.  Being able to simply screw a large jar of grape jelly directly onto the feeder base is the perfect solution.  Even better, the stirrer located on the bottom of the Perky-Pet Oriole jelly feeder conveniently provides portion control.  Squeezing the jelly jar quickly refills the base too.  I wondered if rain would turn the jelly into a watery mess, but that has not been the case and the holes in the base help drain off water build-up.This jelly feeder is an oriole magnet.  We usually attract a few orioles with oranges, but after putting up this feeder, they swarm the yard.  Just before their return, we noticed pretty house finches sampling the jelly too."
923,470,5,"I have used similar plastic shaker containers and liquid sprays around the outside perimeter of my previous and current homes. You need to follow the instructions carefully, these call for water the shaken pellets after deploying them, and also calls for removing leaves and vegetation in the treated region. I did the former, but was by no means complete on the latter process. Treatment seems pretty effective, though by no means a magic bullet. Needs to be repeated a couple of times each summer season (in the upper midwest). I do not use anything indoors in parallel with this."
548,669,5,"These scissors are designed to be the ultimate multi-purpose scissors.  I found them to be amazingly up to every task I have tried them on.  These scissors are very sharp and comfortable to use.  I did not have any issues using these and I have a very small hand (I am a pretty tiny person).  I easily cut through one of the cardboard boxes that Amazon sends their products in.  These also worked well with some light pruning (cutting flowers for the house).  The other features I tried were the tape cutter, the bottle opener, the sharpener, and the knife feature and all were easy to use.  Although some users have had issues with the scissors coming apart as they used them, this has never been an issue for me.  While I found it pretty easy to take the scissors apart when I wanted to, they have never come apart as I used them.  I think this may be a difference in hand size,  when they are cutting, someone with large hands may open the scissors to the point where the T hinge is released.These scissors also got a big thumbs up from my husband who has also been using them around the house.  These are definitely a great product."
1157,154,5,"This is a fine little scoop. I use mine for scooping charcoal into my chimney starter, and it's big enough, strong enough, good enough, and darn it, people like it. While I wouldn't go quite so far as one reviewer in saying that it looks like a $100 item from a specialty store (wish I owned a specialty store in his/her neighborhood lol), it does look well made, the finish is decent, and it is sturdy enough to lift a lot more of whatever you're lifting than will fit into the scoop.That's the scoop as I see it, hope some of you find my review helpful!"
352,868,2,"I am disappointed with this hanging basket. The chain came apart the moment I touched it and although it wasn't broken, I just needed to attach the links together again and tighten them up, it still took some time and was rather annoying considering I had only just opened the box. The frame of the basket is rather minimal; the metal ribs are thin and very far apart from each other. The liner is made of the same biodegradable material that vegetable plants come in, which is fine for when you're planting pots in the ground but terrible for a hanging basket that will be in full view on your porch or deck. If the metal ribs would have been thicker and closer together then you wouldn't notice the liner as much, however it looks very cheap in this bare bones of a hanging basket. Overall I feel as though this product is over-priced and not at all sturdy enough or attractive enough. I'd recommend finding something else."
386,941,4,"This Rumford expanding hose is great for people who hate coiling up the hose to put it away - which, I think, includes everyone who has ever used a hose.  This thing is easy to hook up - probably easier than most hoses because it is so light-weight.  The valve on the end is very handy.  Once the water is on, the hose pressurizes, and it is easy to pull it out to expand to the length needed, up to the full length.When I'm finished using it, I turn off the water, keep the spray open to let the water out of the hose, and it practically springs back to a minimal length, and is super-easy to put away!  Awesome!!!My only - minimal - complaint is that when I have it pulled out to my garden, there is always some tension on it, always some pull, pulling it back towards the hose bib.  So I'm always pulling on it to keep it where I want.  But for how easy it is to put away, I'm willing to deal with that."
142,849,4,"We are comparing this unit to 3 other feeders that we currently own in the backyard of Minnesota winter. If you kept up with the news it's been a cold one! We placed this side-by-side with two other similar style feeders and it is the most popular of the two right now (All three have the same feed). I believe the birds like it for the larger holes/access ports. The squirrels have left it alone (or gave up on it) as we haven't seen any on or attempting to gain access to the feeder. That being said they do sit underneath it and wait for the picky bird eaters to throw down the seeds they don't like. Smart little rodents. The colors and materials which are metal are quite nicely painted and coppered. The only part that concerns me tis the plastic sheeting windows. They seem a bit on the thin side, I am presuming so they can be bent to fit the curve of the feeder, but I question how long they will survive summer heat and winter cold. I will update the review should they ever wear out. For now they are holding strong and allow us to see when the feeder is getting low. Glass would be a nicer alternative but would likely drive up the price of the unit.The other part I don't care for, but I suspect is part of the squirrel retardant features is that the wire loop it hangs from creates a lot of movement when a feathered friend comes to land on one of the stems. The feeder rotates around the wire and spins at a moderate rate until resting again naturally. This doesn't seem to bother the smaller birds, but the jays and cardinals don't care for it and pick the older feeder that has a sold bracket and does not spin.Overall I am happy with this unit so far and would give it 4 stars."
890,906,5,This is a nice quality heavy-duty hose. Three features I appreciate; the extra-large fitting on the faucet end makes it easier to attach and tighten to the faucet without resorting to a wrench. The rigid plastic sleeve at the faucet end to keep the hose from kinking at the faucet and the fact it is drinking water safe.  I did extensive hose searching last summer and found that any hose certified drinking water safe will be right around the price range Amazon is selling this one for. Because the hose has thick walls it is resistant to kinking but I have yet to run across a hose that absolutely will not kink.  I am using this one on a hose reel and it is easy to pull out and wind back up. I expect this hose will last quite some time.
769,167,5,"I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof. When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer, Raccoons or Squirrels to go. Spray and they will not come in that area. I sprayed and it worked just great. after thirty days I sprayed again, you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last longer, overall good product."
51,347,4,"I do a fair amount of gardening -- previously, I'd been using a ho or a shovel to till the soil before planting.  This cultivator does a much better job of breaking the soil up into smaller pieces.  The handle could be better to hold (it seems sometimes like it needs to be at more of an angle or something, to be able to jam it into the ground).  I do have very hard, clay-like soil where I live, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  Generally, this does an ok job, at a good price."
1117,924,2,"I glanced at the other reviews as I was scrolling down to the customer review button, and I see a common theme that is consistent with my opinion.  This feeder is not as good as I was expecting.  It looks and seems cheap.  If I had not received this for free to review I would be returning it.  I even debate hanging it up.  The grey part looks like plastic, although when I tap on it sounds like metal.  My husband's first comment was the squirells can probably get into it. It is very small.  It's under $20, but still I think there are better ones out there for the same price, or invest a little more money to get a better one."
708,287,5,"Although I could have gotten this for about 20.00 less at a local store, I'd have had no way to get it home, so I ordered it from Amazon. Within days it was delivered to my door and a short time later it was out of the box and assembled without difficulty.I do a lot of yard work, about 100 square feet worth of vegetable 'square foot gardening' as well as my large flower garden, and various improvement projects. I wanted some sort of wagon to help with hauling stepping stones, tree clippings, loads of freshly mixed planting soil and so on. This gorilla cart has been a fabulous work mate! It's sturdy and strong, the wheels roll easily over uneven ground, they turn on a dime for excellent maneuverability, and best of all is the dump feature!!Oh how I love that dump feature! Just pull the leaver in front and lift up a bit on the bed. The back wheels fold inward allowing you to dump the load exactly where you want it. What a marvelous design! Why didn't someone think of that sooner?!This cart has made yard work sooooo much easier! When I need to replant any of my many many large pots, I just carry them in the cart over to the potting table rather than in my arms.Large bag of trash or yard clipping to go out? Save your back and just tote it in your cart just as easy as you please.Putting in a new walkway with pavers? Unload the stones from your trunk into the cart and transport them to the yard easily with no sore muscles afterwards.Don't scratch your arms all over while moving trimmed tree branches, just load them on your Gorilla Cart and haul them away.I even use my cart to haul things from the house to the shed and vice-versa.This cart has a 600 pound capacity, good sized tires that run easily over rough terrain, slick and easy dump ability, and for those who have a lawn tractor this carts handle converts to connect for towing. This is such a fabulous idea, it's tough, it's versatile, very functional, and fun! My Gorilla cart has quickly become my favorite yard tool! I Love It!"
1372,291,5,"this is a well made heavy duty stainless steal meat injector. this is so much better then the cheap plastic injectors I've been using wished I bought this years ago. the needles are 6"" long & work very well. I don't see any problems with cross threading when putting together like one reviewer have stated I guess it could happen if your not careful. this injector works great just remember to keep the rubber seal oiled I use vegetable oil that way the seal won't roll up and come off. I think this was worth the money I would buy this again."
143,771,4,"With Spring arriving, I sprinkled this around all of my favorite plants in the yard.  It is all-purpose so it is good for feeding flowers, shrubs, potted plants and even vegetables and fruit trees.  My plants were badly in need of food and this fit the bill - they are thriving now.  If you are a more serious gardener, you might first consider getting your soil tested to see what its deficiencies are prior to using this product.  As a general pick-me-up for your plants though - Miracle Grow is a solid bet."
1415,853,4,This is a nice product and is well made.  It includes clear plastic liners.  It is smaller than I expected.  The liners don't have the depth you would want for long-term plantings.  I am going to use it for seedlings so it will be fine for that purpose.  If you want something for permanent plantings this is probably not for you as there is not enough room for root growth and drainage would pose a problem.
1522,503,5,"I really like this saw for around my home, it very powerfull and get the job done. Im not cutting large trees are anything larger than 6 inches around. I have used it to remove some old poisonous trees, and some poisonous shrubs around our home. It does a great Job and it easy to remove the chain and bar, My only worry is there is a small flat o-ring that could be easily lost, and The biggest thing about this saw is the handguard is stationary it doesn't lock back when kick back occurs, it uses a metal anti kick back device on the tip of the bar that comes lose even with a lock nut on it."
1022,912,5,"I have not used this unit, as it was a house-warming gift for a friend.  I have a couple friends that own these, and they love them."
952,502,2,My original review was a five star. I am dropping it to two and I will explain below.The older Gilmour soaker hoses are excellent if you have one that was made before 2012 HANG ON TO IT AND DON'T LET IT GO.THE HOSES THEY SELL NOW ARE NOT THE QUALITY ONES THEY SOLD ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.I own several of the older hoses. I needed two more. I ordered them and the new is not the same quality as the old. The old ones have two seams and are heavy duty. On the older ones if you had a kink in the line all you had to do was turn the water on and the hose would straighten itself out. Not so with the new ones. Once they are kinked they stay kinked. This is an issue with me because I run mine through cattle panels that I tie my tomato plants to. It's harder for me to get the kinks out in a system like this. It was not an issue with the older hoses.The newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old. Oh they are still a good hose but not nearly as good as they were just a few years ago.I am not sure but I think the price of the new hose is higher than the old. So basically they have reduced their costs by making a lower quality hose and increased their profits even more by charging a higher price. I still need more hoses but they will not be the Gilmour brand. Their short term business practices have lost them a long term customer because I now have to assume that they have probably lowered the quality on all their products.I dislike doing reviews like these. I really like my old Gilmour hoses and originally wrote a glowing review on them. I think that is what irritated me the the most. People may have bought the newer hoses based on my review. I'm glad Amazon lets us edit these reviews even after they are a couple of years old.If Gilmour changes back to selling the old high quality hose I will edit this review again.
1407,213,3,"BRIEFLYTo answer the obvious question [does it work?] - yes, it does. If a mouse goes inside, attracted by the peanut butter bait (ahhh... the smell of it) and places its front legs on one electrode and the rear legs or maybe the tail on the other electrode, then the mouse gets zapped and dies. We saw it happen once with this trap. If we are to refine the question and ask ""does it work better than a much less expensive mouse trap?"", then that's where we need to discuss this specific brand because, as far as actually catching mice, the answer does not seem to be 'yes'.OUR EXPERIENCEWe only have the occasional field mice in our basement, possibly attracted by the warmth in the winter but, unless chased away or caught, seem to settle and grow families, which we don't want to see happen. We've been quite successful at trapping them and, recently, discouraging them from settling in the first place via an ultrasound-producing device but, before we did that, we didn't like the fact that the cheap, under-a-dollar spring traps had to be moved around and even taken away after a couple of catches because the mice seemed to learn what the traps were about and to avoid them. So, we ordered the Victor because we hoped that, since the other mice could not see their dead comrade, they would be more likely to give it a try.For a test, we placed the Victor and a cheap trap, about 6 feet from each other. We used the same bait - peanut butter and... the cheap trap caught 2 mice in 2 weeks while Victor caught one.OPERATIONThe Victor kills your mice by the method of electrocution. Apparently, this is considered to be safe and humane because the mice die quickly. To make it work, you will need 4 AA batteries (not included), a little bit of peanut butter attached to the back wall and you turn it on and place it wherever mice were spotted. The mouse should be able to smell the bait, walk inside and get zapped to death. When that happens, a green light will blink for either a day or for 7 days (the documentation is not clear in that respect and we didn't wait for longer than one day with the dead mouse inside). You then turn off the trap (there's a switch) dispose of the dead mouse, clean up the box if needed, place fresh bait and repeat the cycle.EVALUATIONSo far, this trap caught half as many mice the 'cheap' device did but, unlike the cheap trap that would kill a mouse by breaking its neck or spine and, sometimes would catch and cripple the mouse without actually killing it, this one would kill it quickly and that's a plus. In addition, it's possible to catch the mouse and dispose of it without actually seeing it - with some practice, you can remove the lid and let the dead mouse drop into a bag without looking. And, finally, it's possible that, if the other mice don't see the dead one because it's killed inside the box, they are more likely to give it a try themselves but this is only speculation.I will award this device 3 stars (means ""it's okay"") because it did catch one mouse in our basement and it killed it as described. I will not return it and, now that I have it, I will continue to use it but, knowing what I know today, I would not buy one unless I really couldn't stand the site of dead little mice but I wanted to kill them anyway."
1001,45,2,"The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot."
798,829,5,Price is right and this little brush really cleans the grill surface fast and easy.  This doesn't look like it's going to wear out anytime soon.
1030,788,5,Almost all the birds in our yard are those little brown sparrows. They took to this immediately and drained it in one day. The feeder itself is a nice change to the tube with perches out of the side style that I have.Feeder is very attractive and a nice addition to my yard. It came well-packed and was easy to fill and hang.No complaints here!
1360,796,4,"This hummingbird feeder is a pretty standard design with the benefit of having a top that screws on which can be used for filling the bottle with hummingbird nectar. This is a fairly heavy glass bottle - not cheap plastic - which feels substantial. I had just a little difficulty attaching the bottom parts which are the resevoir for the nectar. These pieces are plastic and feel as though they could break if you exert much pressure. Again, though the design looks like most every other hummingbird feeder out there, it is a substantial piece.  It is mounted outside my window where I hope to soon see hummingbirds coming to eat."
342,7,5,"This is the latest version of an edger B&amp;D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model."
1033,234,5,I own a few Fiskars axes.This hatchet is excellent! Well balanced and keeps it's edge.Very durable handle.I suspect it would last a million years in a landfill..Nice nylon sheath included.This is the perfect small hatchet for preparing kindling.Hot knife through butter..Easy to control.
580,637,4,"It's really too early to tell how effective this product is--I just planted my first snap peas last weekend, and put some of this ""Concern Weed Prevention Plus for Gardens"" into the soil along with them.  Based on reviews and information I have seen online, I have high hopes.I do in-ground vegetable beds, and spend far more time than I would like pulling out sprouting grass, dandelions, and other weeds that find my rich, nice soil a perfect place to grow.  I've tried a few more toxic solutions like a perimeter of RoundUp but that leaves everything dead and yucky and not pretty at all--the opposite effect one wants from a backyard garden.I like that this ""Weed Prevention Plus"" is all-natural and can be used for edible plants.  According to the bag, it starts new seeds from sprouting, so it won't affect seedlings and planters that are already growing.  That's exactly what I want, so here's hoping it works as advertised."
1639,167,4,"I use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall because the deer keep them ""pruned"".  The deer always browse the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so since I started using this product, I've seen footage of the deer going to the bushes, nibble & walking away.  Yea!  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain ""resistant"" & it did last through several significant rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it.  I could still see the milky residue on the leaves although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 90-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.The milky residue is not terrible looking but it is visible up close;  I think it looks better than putting up fence around all the bushes.  It does have a noticeable odor for a couple hours after application.  You may want to consider that if you're spraying near your patio & planning on having dinner there.  But it's not very offensive; just kind of sour smelling.This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering the ingredients are not unusual.  The battery sprayer is a nice option if you have any weakness or arthritis in your hands or arms (the 4 AA batteries are included).  Just make sure to rinse off the end of the nozzle when you're done spraying or it will probably be clogged next time you use it.  I just turn off the power to the sprayer (lock position), open the little spray nozzle all the way & put it under running water.  I've had no clogs so far.UPDATE 8/2012:  This is working really well.  My plants have grown more than any other year & the deer/rabbits are staying away.  This is the only thing I've tried (other than fencing) that keeps them from nibbling.  I reapply the repellant every 2-3 weeks if there has been any significant rain."
302,167,4,"I live in southern Connecticut where at times it seems like the deer outnumber the people. That's fine with me since most of the time I prefer the company of animals to people (I'm a wildlife and travel photographer and writer). But that said, white-tailed deer can really do a number on expensive gardens and fencing seems pointless. I've seen huge deer clear a six-foot fence like it was a few inches tall. It's amazing how graceful and how high these deer can jump--and from a standing position. You have to admire their athletic skills. But oh, yes, there is still that matter of expensive gardens.I don't have much of a problem with deer in my own garden (but there are some raccoons I'd like to have a word with), so I got this (from the Vine program) for a friend of mine that lives in a slightly more rural area and has a two-acre garden--a mix of shrubs and a large organic vegetable garden. Since this product is labeled as ""all natural and organic"" he was willing to try it. Unfortunately we hit a cold spell just as the product arrived and you're supposed to use this when the temps are stable at 40-degrees F and above. So, we had to wait (in the meantime, the deer did a number on a lot of his shrubs). But in the past week the temps have begun to stabilize at around 40F and the rains and snow have relented a bit. (You obviously should not use this during a wet spell since the rain will wash it away.) So this week we sprayed.I have to say that the sprayer works very well (it takes a bit longer to prime than they suggest, no problem) and has a sufficient force to cover even tall shrubs and some apple trees (have you ever seen a deer on its hind legs? Almost nothing is out of reach). The sprayer uses 4 AA batteries and that seems reasonable and they don't weigh much.How is it working? It's only been a few days, so not enough time to really judge--but yes, the deer do seem to be avoiding the area that we sprayed--amazing. And theoretically, at least, the spray will deter them for up to three months. If this is true (time will tell), then it's worth the price a few times over. If you save one $100 shrub, well, there you go.I will report back in a few weeks. We're keeping a close eye on this garden and even shot some ""before"" video (right after the spraying) to try and keep the whole project honest. More to follow in a few weeks. By the way, I've been using Havahart traps since I was a kid and they are the best thing going for live-catching animals. Part of the reason that I became a wildlife photographer was that my parents gave me a trap when I was a kid and I became fascinated with the backyard animals.Update: 5/28/13: Seems to be working, there is considerably less deer traffic in the area where we sprayed it (twice). We got some rain after the first spraying, so that might have diminished its effectiveness, but had five days of nice weather after the second spraying and we have noticed that the shrubs seem to be enduring fewer attacks."
271,925,4,"We love our summer cardinals, finches, and hummingbirds.  We love our cats, too, and lowlying birdbaths and birdfeeders are just too tempting for our furry friends.  I was thrilled to see this hanging bird waterer.  It's the perfect solution to the backyard dilemma.  I've hung it in a tree so it's handy for perching birds, but out of reach of marauding felines who are too fat to climb.  Truthfully, the backyard balance of power is pretty equal, and we've had very few casualties.The waterer itself is large.  It'll hold 64 ounces and the top is semi open so it can accept rainwater.  It's a little tricky to assemble, but operates on the same principle as the dog and cat waterer that invert a reservoir over a bowl and the water level is controlled by physics and a spring.  The unit is pretty heavy when full, and the hanging loop isn't all that sturdy, so I hope it can stand up to the outdoors and the water's weight.This is a wonderful offering to our backyard birds, who seem to like us in spite of the Meowing Menaces.  We've had some of the same bird families for years, and I'm thrilled to be able to provide them with some extra comfort this summer."
973,83,1,"Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying."
1199,577,5,"We bought a house over a year ago and last winter I had the hubby lay out glue traps all over the basement (just in case).  Well, they sat there for a year collecting these hideous spider crickets and dust.  Lazy as we are, we've just left them down there for a year until a week ago I happened to glance at one and there was a dead mouse on it!  EEEEEEKKKK!  I flew up the stairs so quickly and screamed for my husband to get rid of it.  We got these Kill & Seal traps, baited them with peanut butter and put them in the basement.It was a very simple procedure, just put a tiny bit of peanut butter on the cap and screw it in.  You arm the trap by pulling down the plastic lever which simultaneously opens the door to the trap and sets the spring snap.  The mouse goes in and around the corner to the bait and when the spring snaps it dead, the door closes also.  We caught a mouse within 24 hours of putting the trap down.When my husband brought it upstairs, we weren't sure if there was really a mouse in it since the mouse had gone around the corner.  He shook it around a little bit and opened the door again and I could spot a little foot.  Then I did another little freak out action.For the truly squeamish, I think that no amount of money is too much to spare to prevent viewing and the need to handle vermin.  The trap is also good for protecting my kids' fingers and pets from getting snapped.  Finally, the big bonus is for when you've been lazy about checking the traps.  Other stories about decomposing mouse bodies rotting and releasing fluids and blood.........yuck.  Here, you have a door that seals shut and it's closed in.Mice can squeeze through holes only a 1/4 inch thick, so I think the opening is plenty large for a mouse who is determined to get to the food.  If the trap is not catching anything, consider moving it to a different location against the wall, spreading a little freebie bait near the door to lure the mouse in, and/or checking to see if you don't have other easily accessible food sources available to the mice.Update (11/7):We caught a total of 2 mice since the time we put out traps.  The first one was with this Victor Kill & Seal Mouse Trap.  The other Victor Kill & Seal Mouse Trap actually had its bait removed but the mouse must not have triggered the spring!  Lucky mouse!  The second mouse we caught with theVictor Electronic Mouse Trap.  Both were trapped from the first 3 days of putting out the traps.  It's been a month and we haven't caught any more mice (even the peanut butter that we put at the entrance of the traps as ""appetizers"" have been unmolested) which shows that our immediate results weren't a fluke and weren't a result of a complete infestation of mice.  Very happy to have the product.  As far as the trap that didn't spring, someone pointed out, rightly so, that even the cheapie traps don't always spring.  So that mouse gets lucky and lives to see another day, but you'll catch him next time.  If you are uncomfortable with that, try the electronic mouse trap which has a lower rate of escapee mice.If you found this review helpful, please let me know."
1634,812,4,"This base is VERY sturdy, and heavy (about 30#).  Once you place it somewhere, you will not want to move it very often.  It's very durable and functional, but I can't really say that it's ""pretty"".  The pictures show this base being used with a table, but in my opinion, if you have a table then you probably would use a different base that's a lot less expensive than this one that doesn't have to be as sturdy as this one.  This base is more suited for a stand-alone base for an umbrella.  I like the fact that it's large. . . square and flat.  This makes it easy to place something on top of it.  The large size makes it less likely to tip-over due to wind."
1403,622,4,"Snail activity has been visibly reduced, but it's hard to tell whether it's the snail killer driving the snails away, or just the unusual weather we've been having lately.  If I knew for sure that it was the snail killer driving the snails away, I'd give this product five stars.  In any case, it looks like I have some circumstantially positive testimony for this product."
486,730,4,"This new Remington electric trimmer offers much more power than my old trimmer.  In addition, it has an adjustable stem so that it can be customized for people of different heights.  The plastic cutter strings are extended not by bumping the machine on the ground but by hitting a switch on the side of the machine.  I bumped the machine on the ground several times before convincing myself to use the switch to extend the string.This is a good trimmer that offers excellent performance; however, it may not be the trimmer I use personally because it is heavier than my old trimmer.  I am much smaller than the average American, and adding extra weight to the trimmer means, for me, that the machine is more difficult to control and that I tire much more quickly when using the trimmer.For small folk, this may not be the trimmer you want.  For everyone else, however, you'll be pleased with the machine and with your results.Four Stars!"
941,914,4,"The feeder comes with a jar you can scoop jelly into or you can just use a jar of jelly from the store.After screwing it into place you turn the feeder over.There is a handle underneath where you can stir it to make more jelly come out but you won't need that for a while probably.I hung mine in a big Oak tree with 2 regualr bird feeders that use seed and a hummingbird feeder that uses liquid.To be honest, I haven't seen any birds using this jelly feeder.It's in the shade so I don't hae to worry about the sun baking the jelly.And when it rains there is some water in the feeding tray standing beside the jelly.So why am I giving 4 stars to something that doesn't seem to attract birds even though it's in a busy location?I guess I'm in a good mood and I appreciate something that works at dispensing the food even if it isn't all that attractive.Just give me something that does what it's supposed to do.  That's all I ask.If the right type of birds aren't around to take advantage of it I can't control that.Maybe your yard will have some birds that like jelly for a meal.  I hope so."
1218,680,4,"This itme has been a tremendous help for me when cutting my large red tips.  The biggest draw back is the weight distribution.  As all of the other reviews have stated, it will take you some time to get use to all of the weight being place on your arms and shoulders."

1039,648,5,I used this to de-weed a large flower bed over the weekend.  This works better than my old one.  The curve really helps pry against the ground while causing minimal impact to the mulch around the weed (doesn't stir dirt on top of the mulch).
1627,933,4,"Perky Pet says that this is their best glass hummingbird feeder. That's quite a qualified statement, so it's hard to argue that this is Perky Pet's best glass feeder (as opposed to their other glass feeders, or their other plastic feeders). The glass cylinder gives it a good appearance, and its 30 ounce capacity should supply the needs of all but the most hungry hummingbirds.I didn't have any issues with leaking in the four weeks that I've been using the feeder, as has been mentioned in other reviews. The base comes apart, making cleaning easy, unlike their super-sized 48-ounce feeder that I also tested. The neck of the glass cylinder is a bit narrow, so you will need a bottle brush or some practice with swishing a wettened paper towel or cloth to get the inside surface cleaned. The red plastic cap has a loop for the supplied S-hook, and it can stand inverted on a flat surface so that it can be filled without tipping.This feeder comes with a small packet of nectar concentrate, and I would advise tossing it in the garbage and mix up a fresh batch of nectar by boiling water and mixing four parts water with one part sugar. This is the recipe most recommended by experts, and it skips the unnecessary and possibly harmful red dye. I know that Perky Pet says on the label that it won't hurt the birds, but it's not necessary to have red juice, so why add the dye and take the chance?For a cylinder-style feeder, this is a decent unit. However, I still like the dish-style feeders that are available from Aspects under the name &#34;Hummzinger&#34; here on Amazon. Wild Birds Unlimited sells the same type. These are hands-down the best feeders I've ever used, so while this feeder might be the best glass feeder sold by Perky Pet, it's not the best overall hummingbird feeder in my opinion.Even given that fact, I'm giving this a four-star rating, because it does have some good features and I didn't run into any major issues. I would spend my money on something else, but if this type of feeder appeals to you, I think you will like it."
339,186,5,"I've had my share of trowels over the years, and my main complaint was that they were basically all too small.  Sometimes you just need a bigger shovel, to either dig wider or deeper, and the 'regular' ones just don't cut it.  Enter Fiskars Big Grip.  I saw this in Target and grabbed it immediately; I knew it was simply something I had to have, being a hard core gardener.  I haven't had a job that this has been too small for yet, always planting and moving plants.  It wouldn't be too handy if needing to move or plant something large, when a full size shovel is necessary, but every gardening tool set needs this trowel.  Well made & sturdy, definitely one of my best gardening supply purchases..."
127,27,5,"There is plenty of grill space to hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, steaks or shrimp kabobs. Easy to regulate the heat using the vents.  Love that the lid can hang on the grill to block the wind or just rest there while flipping your food....frees both hands!"

447,188,5,"After trying several other traps, sprays, etc., this finally worked on our squirrel problem. Traps them alive after they go after a little nut we've put as bait; then we just drive them to a new location (granted it has to be rather far) but better than other options."
302,792,5,"I have several bird feeders (suet, thistle, seed, etc.) in my yard here in Connecticut and I get a tremendous number and variety of birds. I always feel a bit guilty though that I don't pay enough attention to their water needs and it can get hot and dry here by July. I have a bird bath, but I'm not great at keeping it filled. For those reasons, this little water cooler for birds really appealed to me.I have to say I'm more than pleased with the quality and the design. First, it's very rugged and I don't think that, even if it fell from the hook where I have it hanging, that it would get hurt. Also, its very simple to use--just unscrew the base, fill it with water, re-attach the base and (quickly) flip it right-side up and you're ready to go. It's that easy. And the threads are very strong and the dish part screws on very securely.The loop at the top of the bottle makes it easy to hang. I used one of those elongated s-hooks that are used to hang a hanging pot from a branch or whatever and it works perfectly. A piece of nylon fishing line would work fine, too.I really am very pleased with this and I think it will be a hit with the birds (I just put it out today, so still waiting for the first customers). I'm hanging it next to my screened porch to keep the cats entertained. It's nice to find an affordable product like this that does what it says it will do, is nicely made and serves a good purpose. A great gift for your bird-feeding friends, too. I'll post some photos once the birds belly up to the bar.By the way, a few reviewers have said that they have had it up for a while and no takers yet. I suggest posting a sign nearby, pointing to the waterer. (Kidding.) It takes a little while for birds to feel safe around anything new in your yard. They see it, they know it's there, they'll come. If you want to attract them faster, try letting a hose drip into a bucket nearby for a few hours a day for a few days--birds are extremely attracted to moving water. If they think water is in the area, they will investigate more."
1605,844,3,"Why do I like the ThermaCELL better?  Because the Deet-free insect repellent in ThermaCELL not only discourages mosquitoes, it also keeps away no-see-ums, gnats, biting flies and sand flies.  ThermaCELL refills are easy to find in your local discount or sports store, as ThermaCELL is used by hunters year-round.  The fragrance from a ThermaCELL is very light; the Cutter fragrance is very apparent and masks the scent of the sea breeze and the sweetness of your magnolia blossoms, or whatever fragrances you love in your yard.This Cutter lantern is specifically made to set on a table, and with its light--that goes on when the fan goes on--it is obviously meant to be used at night.  There is no way to use the repellent without the light.  Often, when I sit on the front porch at night, I do not want a light.  Unfortunately, that is not an option with this lantern.The fragrance of the Cutter repellent is somewhat like Citronella and while it kept the 'skeeters away, I did not find it pleasant when it was right in front of me on a table top.  When we set it near the floor, the dog went and sat up-wind of it...  Sixty-four square feet is only an 8'x8' area, so you can't put this lantern too far up or down or too far away from you before it won't be protecting you.I like the size of theThermaCELL Cordless Portable Mosquito Repellent Appliance (Olive).  The size and shape of this Cutter lantern limits where you can put it.  And you can't hang it.  There are loops on the Thermacell that allow me to rig it up in such a way that I can hand it almost anywhere.Cost of refills--for both the Cutter and the ThermaCELL--seems to be similar.  Granted, I'm comparing butane to  batteries, and different sizes and length-of-use of repellent refills, but having used both products, it still seems to equal out.One tip:  If you find that the mosquitoes are still finding you, try re-positioning the product up-wind of where you are sitting.One more tip about this Cutter product:  Double-check that the repellent cup is firmly- and well-seated before moving the lantern.  If the cup falls out, the sponge inside the cup will fall out and you will loose a good amount of the repellent solution.  Been there, done that...."

148,335,5,"The Orbit 3-way faucet valve is absolutely great so far. One or two reviewers almost scared me off by saying you should get the metal one instead, but I had a metal 2-way faucet valve and hated it. It leaked, it was too hard to turn the dials and it was surprisingly insubstantial for metal.This faucet valve comes with a brace you can attach to the back to bear some of the weight of the hoses, but I didn't attach it and I don't think I need to. Everything is tight and sturdy as can be. Maybe the angle of my faucet coming out of the wall makes it unnecessary to have a brace. After my experience with my last 2-way faucet valve I bought some washers for this one, but I haven't needed them at all. Not a drop of escaped water. I run a hose to one garden, a hose to a second garden in the opposite direction, and a hose across the yard to a dog pen. I had forgotten that sometimes I need water at the faucet for other things as well and was thinking about getting a 4-way faucet, when I realized the end cap screws off and there is your 4th outlet, and even a fifth one on the other side.I love this thing. It has solved so many problems for me. And again, it's sturdy! Nothing moves when I yank on one of the hoses. What a difference from my ""better"" metal one!Update -One month of constant use later: This connector has had a workout. Everything still works smoothly. I guess that is what impresses me most after having struggled with a brass connector. The individual dials turn sooo easily and when they are off, there is no leakage. This whole thing is so well made.Another update -One year later I am having to buy another one. I think the couple of deep freezes we had this winter did it in. But the price makes it painless to replace."

831,919,5,"These bird spikes are not the cruel item that they look like. In fact they can protect birds by keeping their nests away from dangerous areas.For the past few years birds have tried to nest in a hanging flower basket by my front door. The one year they succeeded and laid eggs, every time the door opened or someone came up on the porch they flew away in a panic, swinging the basket and in the process lost an egg. This wasn't too pleasant for any of the humans that got near it either. I also had birds try to nest in the rafters under my deck where they then panicked anytime someone stepped out on to it.These spikes solved that problem. I had previously been using plastic forks. These look better and are also more effective. I used a bolt cutter to snap the 10 foot spikes into smaller pieces that would fit into the under deck areas. They really did not break/snap into shorter lengths. I also used screws and an electric screwdriver to fasten them which was better than trying to drive nails. I put a small piece in my hanging basket and covered the base of it with potting soil after securing it with toothpicks.The result is the birds have found better places and the humans are happier too."

778,827,3,"The lid is impossible.  I think the problem was the black seal on ours wasn't stable, so the whole lid turned.  It's very childproof.  It was adult proof too.  After I gave up trying, I gave it to my quite capable DYI hubby to open.  He was working on a toilet tank at the time, but gave it 5 minutes then started cussing.  I was afraid I'd get popped with an elbow if the thing flew off.  After 10 minutes he said &#34;We're just going to have to cut this thing off, get me a knife. I'd give it a 1 star just because of that lid if I were you&#34;I didn't want to keep frustrating him, so I took it in the kitchen and got a knife.  I cut down into the 2 child safe rings, but it still wouldn't unscrew, because the black seal turned around too, and there wasn't anything to use vise grips on to hold it.  I was ready to just stab the can to get the oil out, but stabbed the black seal instead, and that let me unscrew it.  What a pain!The oil itself says it is a vegetable based oil with citrus.  It smells like oranges and lemons, but maybe those oils were not cold pressed- I smell a hint of a solvent in it, or perhaps the oil is a bit rancid, but it is supposed to be all natural.  It smells fairly nice when on the wood.It's fairly thick- it reminds me of olive oil, it seems to get thicker and cloudier when cold and absorbs into a paper towel like that.  I don't see the ingredients listed so I'm not sure.  It slightly darkens the wood, and then water repels off.  The wood smells nice and looks new.  I used it on my garden bench, and it looks new again, and hopefully it will help it last longer.  The wood absorbed the oil well, and I rubbed my elbow across it- it did not stain my cotton shirt.  I probably would not sit on it with white pants or shirt on for a while, but with it being winter, that's not going to happen anyway.I only have one bed- a salad table, and it made it look nice, again, darkening the wood a bit and giving it a soft 'new' gleam.They need to do something about that horrid lid design if they can though."
489,850,2,"My neighbor' bird feeder attracts a variety of birds as well as squirrels. This seemed promising. Since my husband hung it up several weeks ago I've seen NO birds.

697,834,3,"This formula sold under the Ortho label (a division of Scotts, makers of Miracle-Gro) is a pest deterrent which uses natural essential oils to help keep animals from coming into an area that you desire to protect. This product is generally safe (no harmful chemicals) and has a smell that you may find pleasant, since it includes plant-based oils. The smells can confuse the animals and throw them off the scent of the plants in your garden that they have been disturbing. This is somewhat helpful but not a guarantee. Animals can be fairly smart and maintain a good memory, so if they don't get deterred by the distracting/masking scents and do make it to your plants or crops then you'll need to use another approach. This product is safe and worth trying, doesn't harm animals, and is easy to apply (just do so as directed, e.g. only use outdoors, do not use directly on your plants but rather on the ground around the area to protect, etc.)"
4,345,4,"If you have a mole problem, this is a great tool to help rid the yard of this troublesome critter. This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best."
1545,276,3,"As advertised, this feeder is all metal and it feels like it.  It is the heaviest bird feeder I have ever seen that is made to be suspended from the top.  The feeder empty is over 3 pounds and can hold 5 pounds of sunflower seeds.  Doesn't sound like a lot but if you plan on hanging this from a tree limb it has to be a fairly strong one.  The color is a definite brown.  Nothing flashy.  Filling is a snap except that it is annoying having a seeds pop out of the mesh when moving back to hang.  I have had a tubelike feeder in my yard for years and the birds are just starting to realize there is a another ""restaurant"" on the block.  The birds are already all over this thing.  In addition, our local squirrels are taking generous dips in to seeds.  The mesh wire is a perfect means for them to hang on and eat right out of the bottom plate (check out the pic I posted).  I have moved the feeder to another tree on a smaller branch that is further away from the trunk.  I am a little concerned that if the squirrels launch themselves at this thing, as I have seen them do before, the impact and extra weight may knock this thing to the ground.  If this does happen I may end up retiring this feeder to the garage.  Otherwise, looks cools and the birds/animals like it."
165,874,3,"I received these a little late in the planting season, so I only planted a select few and will plant the rest next year. I chose one of the lettuces, flat leaf spinach, one dill and two cilantro.The pods themselves are nice and neat. These are decent sized pods and definitely not tiny like Aerogarden sized ones. They are easy to plant. Just add them to your potting soil. I used organic for the herbs and a mix of organic and some cheaper soil for the lettuces. The pods have a label that peels back where you can see instructions on how to maintain the plant. Some of these were stuck, so they ripped, making them unreadable. The pack comes with a sample of plant food and tips on how often to fertilize. I used the sample pack, but I normally use Neptune's fertilizer for my plants.I planted these the evening I received them and made sure to place them in a spot where they would receive sufficient sunlight. The weather had cooled down, so it wasn't too harsh for the plants. They were watered daily and the pots they were in seemed to stay moist. After almost 2 weeks, the lettuce and spinach were growing nicely. In the other pot, the herbs have not sprouted at all. There is a little pathetic looking thing growing out of the pot that could be cilantro, but it is not growing from the pod, so I am not sure what it is. I know cilantro is a difficult herb to grow and maintain. I have grown dill in the past though and am disappointed that it hasn't sprouted at all.This set might be good for beginners, for a kids project, or people who live in smaller spaces who want to grow their own food outside their apartment or condo. I agree with the other reviewers that it seems weird that only one bean plant is provided in the kit, but I guess it could be something to nibble on while harvesting the other plants. I look forward to planting the other pods next season and will most likely update this review with those results."

1043,761,5,"I selected this mole trap to test after a friend complained of moles in his yard and delegated the field testing to him.  Today he reported his first kill, which occurred within a couple days of first setting it up.  According to him, if you follow the instructions (generally a good idea when dealing with something that can ram some spring loaded spikes through you if you are not careful, though credit to the manufacturer, injuring yourself with this thing would take some doing!), it arms easily and works perfectly.My friend will be using the trap until he gets them all, and I'll update his score here as battle reports come in.  One possible improvement he suggested was a pin safety attached to a lanyard that would prevent an armed trap from going off until the pin was removed, but I suspect the manufacturer deliberately left a safety off out of fear users would be tempted to move an armed trap (BAD idea, especially since it can be so easily discharged using the trap release lever and then reset in its new location).Note: After killing the second mole and being reset for the third one, the trap was stolen out of an unfenced in yard so if that describes your field of battle you might want to consider chaining it to something heavy."
144,566,4,"This little hoe has nice heft, and is the perfect ""in between"" size for using in your raised beds-a tad larger & stouter than the truly small hand tools and not as big as the full sized version.  I found it perfect in size for working in 4x8' beds where I can't quite reach the center sometimes, and in my raised beds, it's actually long enough that I don't have to stoop as much.I'm not thrilled with the quality of craftsmanship, but it should last quite well with reasonable care, as it isn't designed for grubbing out massive weeds, but rather for working in established beds.  The sheath supporting the joint between metal head and wooden handle is loosely fitted, and suspiciously wimpy in character.Pros: great size, sturdy head, nice shaped headCons: less than great construction"

The stakes have a steel core and a thick plastic coating. It may also be used , flattened as a trellis."
757,943,3,"First off - I live in the south and we have St. Augustine grass - when using this as a mower, even assuming you want to mow your yard 12 inches at a time, this is too short even at the highest setting for St. Augustine grass.  Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.  I had to wait for my husband to get home and get him to do it.  Big fail.  Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight. I just wish it had a little more power, and I wish it would have come with one longer lasting battery as opposed to two small ones."
1161,167,3,"The local deer population pretty much rules my neighborhood. While the squirrels (A.K.A.--""tree rats"") are entertaining, they can also be destructive. That's why I decided to give this product a shot. I was somewhat disappointed with what I received.The battery-powered sprayer is not very strong. The nozzle does not fan out the spray very wide nor far. That made it difficult to reach the branches of my trees that the little buggers like to nibble on.Thankfully, the product does not smell bad--something I was a little concerned about, considering that ""putrescent whole egg solids,"" capsaicin and garlic are its active ingredients. I like that it is made of natural ingredients that won't hurt other animals (especially pets).It doesn't seem to have made much of a difference keeping the pesky critters away from our trees or out of the yard. Although I did hear a squirrel scolding shortly after I sprayed some trees in my front yard, I really can't say whether it's a truly effective deterrent to these animals."

435,260,5,"I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement. My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I usually use peanut butter to bait traps but that can get messy. In addition I have had rodents eat the peanut butter and not set off the trap.  All you do is place a couple of drops on the trap.  The box says it is good for rats as well as mice. I am not sure how long it lasts on the trap before more need to be used.I used this in my shed and did catch a couple if mice with it using the old fashioned wood spring traps."
1209,874,5,"I used a plant dibber (do a search for it if you are unsure what it is) to make the right sized hole for the seed pods, plopped them in it, and watered. A little cardboard measuring guide came with the Gro-ables to make it even easier. Planting these vegetables couldn't possibly be any easier than that.I was pleased with the selection of vegetables and herbs, although I probably never would have planted beans. I had to work around really crazy weather in Oklahoma, waiting for the 100 plus degree weather to pass, then the flooding rains. I grabbed my chance to plant and we'll see what happens. I planted them in containers on wheels, so I can move them into my greenhouse later if necessary. All-in-all, this was fun and not too labor-intensive."

You open it up, dip your stem into the powder, and plunk the stem into your potting mix. It seems to work pretty much the same as any other rooting hormone and isn't any more or any less effective.Overall, this is a product that works exactly as I would anticipate looking at the label. There are no surprises, which is a good thing when you're buying a functional product such as this."

I gave it a four star because I truly like this thing! It's worked through anything above 0 up until this point. I'm really not sure that anything 50 watts would go to -20, but I figured in this part of New England, I wouldn't have to worry. I'm hoping it's not broken at all, but I'll have to wait and see if it does its job when it gets a little warmer (like in the teens or twenties).Again, four stars, because it was totally worth it up to this point and we don't get this bitter cold weather here very often (or for very long periods of time). I just thought it should be mentioned so prospective buyers would be aware:)"

Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process."

1380,192,3,"I have owned my Mantis tiller for nearly 8 years now.  I chose Mantis because I wanted a smaller tiller that did not require a lot of storage space.  I also liked what I saw on tv commercials about the Mantis.  My father had a much larger tiller of another brand that took up a lot of space and was incredibly heavy (but quite sturdy).  He was going to give me his tiller when he stopped gardening, but after thinking long and hard about it, I decided to get the Mantis instead. Here is what I have learned about the Mantis in that time:1.  Mechanical:  The tiller works great, starts in 2-3 pulls right out of the box.  It takes mixed gas at a 50/1 ratio.  Never use ""old"" gas or gas that is not the proper ratio.  Over the years I have had some minor problems with it, mostly related to starting and idling.  My recommendation is to clean or change the air filter regularly.  The filter is easy to get at and oftentimes clogs with dirt and dust.  Change spark plug every couple years.  When putting the tiller ""to sleep"" for the winter, take out the spark plug and pour in a teaspoon of motor oil.  Pull the start recoil and distribute the oil in the cylinder.  I have not had any major problems with the tiller.  I just finished an hour of tilling today and it ran great.  Final tip: clean the accumulated weeds off the tiller tines when they begin to accumulate.  This reduces the stress on the motor.  The blades are faily easy to remove, clan, and return to place - it will prolong the life of the tiller.  Since the Mantis has a smaller engine, it cannot be overstressed.  To compensaate for the smaller engine size, the tiller has extremely sharp blades and they spin very fast.  The engine does not have much torque however, and the engine will bog down in heavy jobs.  The engine will stop if rocks lodge in the tines. If your garden space has a lot of rocks, this is probably not the tiller for you.2.  Functional:  The tiller is lightweight and works best in smaller gardens, although it will work in a large garden too if the soil is lighter.  I like how it can be manipulated with ease around plants and through smaller narrow rows (which a larger tiller cannot do).  I am able to plant rows of vegetables closer together with the Mantis and till around them with ease.  Perhaps most importantly, the Mantis tiller will not work well in heavy soils (with lots of clay).  I experienced this firsthand.  In heavy soils, the tiller cannot penetrate the compacted hard soil and just skims the surface.  I found I had to spade up the heavy soil with a shovel and then till the clumps.  A heavier tiller would have handled the clay soil, so if your soil is compacted and full of clay, this is not the tiller for those conditions.  On the other hand, in lighter soils, the tiller goes through the soil just as depicted on tv.  Excellent tiller for sandy loose soils. The tiller is only about 20 pounds.  It stores easily in most sheds and doe not require a dedicated shed as a large tiller.  Very portable!3.  Overall:  Overall performance is in the 3-star range, mostly because of the limitations of use in clay/havy soils.I do recommend this tiller for the gardener who has a smaller garden, wants to set plantings closer together, and has lighter soil.  I'd recommend a larger heavier tiller for larger gardens or gardens with heavy soil.  As Clint Eastwood said in ""Magnum Force"": ""A man's got to know his limitations"".  Same case with this tiller.  If you don't try to do too much with it, and know what it can handle (and can't), I think you will be pleased with the Mantis tiller.konedog"
490,849,4,We got this for our backyard so our boys could watch for birds. They really like this feeder. The bird feeder is simple to use and just hangs from the tree by a nail. We have had quite a few birds come to the feeder including a wood pecker. It is very easy to fill the feeder with bird seed. Overall a great feeder.
1366,769,5,"I was afraid that this spray would make plants look like they were made of plastic, but it instead just makes them look clean and healthy.

Overall, a nice way to make a plant look more &#34;groomed.&#34;"
976,799,4,"It took me a while to really be able to test this spray.  For right off the top I feel I must tell everyone, this is not a conventional flying insect killer.  It does not come out as a fine mist, and it is not designed for just clearing an area of hornets horning in on your BBQ, nor for any kind of indoor use.  It shoots a powerful jet stream of thick  white foam at least a good 15 feet, and easily more.  And it really is designed to be a nest killer.  The powerful stream keeping you from having to get too close to any nest, and perhaps taking one down that is up in a tree from a short ladder, or maybe just from the ground. That being said, this stuff worked pretty well for me. I had to first locate a nest, and that took a while.  I was finally successful when way in my back yard I found an old window box that had been taken over by a large nest of yellow jackets.  They were actively meandering around the nest when I discovered it, so I waited till very late at night before I soaked it.  The foam comes out thick and white, but quickly liquidates and penetrates.  I used about half the can, and then checked it the next morning.  Although a few bees still seemed to be hanging around, they neither went in nor even got at all close to the nest.  It otherwise seemed very dead. I felt comfortable enough to take the nest apart and found a few living larvae inside, but nothing as to adults. They were all either dead, or dying.  I sprayed again what was left and then threw it out...The effectiveness of this seems somewhat mixed here as to some of the other reviews.  But all I can tell you is that it was effective for me in destroying a large active nest, and they have not returned. It's very easy to use, and as noted, I only used half of a can on a nest that was buried in an old window box.  It could very well be that this foam is more effective for some species of bees than others.  And it could also be that some people are not using it at the best time.  Just remember whenever you have a real active nest to take out, hit it with the poison either very late at night, or very early in the morning before sunrise.  That's the only time that all the bees with be in the nest, and the only time you can be pretty sure to get them all.  I did just that and this foam worked very well.  It also comes at an excellent price here on Amazon, and I recommend it.. : )"

14,661,4,"I bought this to use with my Q240 Electric grill by Weber. The grill fits perfectly, it makes moving around the grill easy, and in general does a really good job. One star taken off because it's a bit flimsy feeling. I have seen no signs that there's any problem with it, it's just very light weight and therefore a bit disconcertingly flimsy. I'd still recommend this product and buy another if I needed one.Because everyone needs two Weber electric grills."
304,796,1,"PLEASE NOTE ADDITION TO REVIEW BELOW.I *love* this hummingbird feeder!!! I have two others, both your standard cheap feeder that is so difficult to fill because of a small opening, and once filled, you have to flip it upside down and it notoriously drips across my deck, inviting ants to the sugar syrup. This Perky-Pet 24 ounce Glass feeder, however, fills from a VERY large top opening! It also has an ""ant moat"" on the top which you can fill with water so your feeder isn't crawling with sugar-seeking ants. What a great idea! Another plus is that this feeder holds a full 24 ounces of food, while the smaller cheaper units hold only 8 ounces. My birds will be so happy!Just an FYI. Do you know you can make your own hummingbird food for your feeder? You don't need to buy the expensive packets that include red food coloring, which the birds don't need. Simply boil 4 cups of water in a pan, add 1 cup of sugar, stir until sugar is dissolved, and boil gently for 2 more minutes. Let it cool and put in your feeder. My birds love this food and there is no reason to have to add any red coloring.I highly, highly recommend this Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder. Another FYI. When you take the feeder out of the box, you'll think it comes with no hook to hang it with, but look under the top lid and you'll find it.My hummingbirds are so happy!ADDED 08/10/13: I return to revise this review. After 2 weeks of using the hummingbird feeder, it started to leak around the base near the flower feeders. This base comes apart for cleaning, but there is no gasket of any kind to create a water tight seal. Once I took it apart to clean, it never sealed properly again. My husband even used an epoxy glue around the base in an effort to seal it, but that didn't work. I ended up having to throw the feeder away!!! So fair warning -- this feeder looks good, has great potential, but since it won't hold the liquid for more than 24 hours it's actually quite useless."
1610,22,4,"I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb."
595,100,4,"I have another B&D; 18 V product, a tree pruner that only came with one battery.  Amazon has a pretty good price on the battery at 32 bucks, but then I saw this unit which comes with 2 batteries and another charger for 6 bucks more than the cost of two batteries!  So now I have two 18V tools and 3 batteries with 2 chargers so I'll never find myself running out of juice again!  Great Deal!Oh the blower is not advertised as a leaf blower, so don't expect the power of of corded or gas unit. But as others have noted it works great on the deck and patio with low noise and no smell of a gas engine.2010 update - it appears that B&D; now includes only one battery with this unit.  Perhaps they realized it was too good a deal or people were not buying the batteries alone.  That's a shame because I would NOT buy this unit with only one battery.  You need at least two to get any work done, run time is not great and of course worsens as the batteries age."
1263,622,4,"I tested Dr Ts Slug and Snail Killer - because of a problem that I had last year with slugs.  The container has 2 openings in the lid; a large single hole for fast pouring and a 3 hole side for sprinkling.  I preferred the 3 hole side of the lid, to help control my dispersal.  The granules or pellets are just a little smaller than the size of the holes in the 3 hold side.  It took a bit of shaking to work the pellets through the holes and out onto the plants/ground.  As a result of much shaking, the pellets start to breakdown and it starts to get rather dusty.  The lid gets dusty, especially when opening after using it for a bit.I appreciate that there is very little smell!!  What little there is, is not a harsh chemical smell but a bit more natural.  The container is a nice size to handle.  I was surprised when I opened it for the first time that it wasn't completely full (much settling had occurred, I guess).  Overall, I had a lot of slugs last year, so hopefully this will make a difference.  So far, I have not seen any slugs this year after treating my outside garden areas."
630,577,5,"Our home is in an area with large lots close to highways so mice are an issue some years.Since we have pets, we won't use regular snap traps inside.

It is lightweight enough that we can easily move it around or bring it in to store if it's going to rain. The cushion is nice and thick and comfortable to use.

But the snails and slugs are doomed.This stuff is wonderful.  Sprinkling it around my plans has drastically reduced the carnage.  The new leaves are actually surviving. The plants are growing again.  The ground is littered with empty snail shells.  Life is good.Highly recommended."
1284,92,3,"So this flow pot is adjustable, can attach to deck railing, and will, in fact, hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter, sure, it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out, but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall, it's an OK adjustable pot holder, but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average."

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient. No fumes or exhaust- because gas mowers don't have catalytic converters, they can pollute as much in a year as 43 cars!!!!.  They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is basically NO maintenance. (We spent $80 over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.) Corded electric mowers are a cheaper but having a cord is a pain.>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower? They weigh a LOT more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it. They don't have as much power as gas and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature.>>What is a watt-hour? It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal? Yes - for two reasons. 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered. Second, when you consider that you have to overlap each pass by ~3"", a 20"" blade now effectively cuts 13% more on each pass. If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18""  Also, my measurements show most mowers overstate their blade size by 1/2"" (Our 20"" measures 19-5/8, our 19 measures 18-1/2)>>Why might I want a removable battery? If you have a large yard, this means you can have a second battery charging while you are using the first. A second battery typically costs $100-$150 but it can make the difference between going electric or not. Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>How long will my batteries last? That depends on your climate and usage. We had a small lot for many years and were religious about recharging right after use. We also live in a cooler climate (Michigan) so it's cooler and the mowing season is shorter. Our batteries lasted ~7 years. Most people should get 3-4 years easily but if you're careless and live in Arizona, you might be able to kill the batteries in a year or two.>>Why should I care about higher voltage? Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster. With the same chemistry and current, a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic? Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue. Plastic ends up giving you a more stuff to trim since you can't cut as close to fences, etc.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!"

Loved the fact that I do not have to grapple with cords while in the yard and it definitely beats using the scrapper broom to clear leaves off my front yard.However, it would be better if the battery was longer lasting as I find that I have to recharge after blowing just half my deck (which is probably a full deck for most houses)."
611,559,5,"I put 2 of these at each of the 3 door thresholds in my house. I don't see any ants around those areas. I need to get more for the window areas because the other brand, which I've put in the kitchen window sill, doesn't seem to be preventing all the ants."
1395,37,5,"I first started using theVictor Ultimate Flea Trapwhen I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs."
1349,416,5,"Everything they claim is true...sturdy construction, easily moved, balanced weight...Those cheap plastic reels, boxes etc...are now a thing of the past.This unit will work!"
1014,906,4,"This is a really nice 50 ft hose for our backyard.  We use it at least every other day to water potted and hanging plants all around the yard and blast the pool deck sometimes too.  It attaches well with the &#34;hose armor&#34; at the spigot and it does prevent the hose from kinking at that spot. It also attaches to the wind-up reel but we already have a little extension to enable any hose to work with it. We drag our hose across the yard and back so it is really nice that this hose coils back up easily.We have found that as we pull it/unwind it to use, that is does still kink but not as bad as cheaper hoses.The hose it really nice because it is heavy duty, light weight, has a good texture to it, is flexible and it winds up well.  It has some sort of anti-bacteria and anti-mold element so that you/your kids can drink from it if needed. It says it has a burst strength of 500 psi so it should hold up with our pool deck cleaning.  Good hose for around 40 bucks."
1492,564,5,"This Plant stand is very high quality. The ones locally are usually covered in vinyl and then rust thru and are quite flimsy and cost more. This is a great price for a beautiful stand. I have a mixed planter of annuals that was sitting on the ground by my swing in the back yard although it looked nice this took it up a step.It is very well packed and the hardest thing you will have to do is remove the bubble wrap that is backed by tape on the feet, Had never seen that before. I used scissors but be very careful not to scratch the leg.I would highly recommend these in sets of different heights it gives such a finished look to your garden. I will try to get a picture posted soon that you can view from above."

119,190,4,"This is a decent, cheap nozzle. It doesn't leak and does not break easily. I bought the yellow so I could spot it in my yard easily. I did break the first one I had, but that was my fault. I was reeling it back in and the handle caught on a rock out of my line of sight. I kept reeling it in anyway, and yanking on the hose until the handle broke. I would say that under normal conditions, and even somewhat rough conditions this nozzle holds up well."
1008,167,5,"When first opening the package and putting it together I noticed how impatient I am.  The included batteries chose not to work as quickly as I expected; however, after changing them for fresh ones and after a little more patience the sprayer for the Havahart Critter Repellent worked with ease and the test began.  Deer Off II is of little value if there are few or no critters who roam the lands.  We have several ""gangs"" of deer, about 2 or 3 families of skunks, several raccoons and squirrels plus a whole hooting nanny of turkeys of different sizes.  Due to the nature of the land layout the deer have established a path from the hill across the street, across the creek and then through the front yard, up the back hill and into the woods.  I put down a blockade of Deer Off II to see if it had any impact.  It worked and after several days of rain and heat it still works.  Yesterday I was watching out for a delivery and I noticed a herd of deer crossing the creek about 100 yards away instead of using their normal path through our yard.  They are so pretty especially now when their antlers are beginning to lose the felt covering but they can eat an azalea plant in a short time.  I cannot tell about the other critters yet.  They mostly travel at night and I do not.  I put down a circle around the garbage can and as of now there have been no signs of critters other than a lizard leaving droppings most would not believe in terms of size for its size.  Nature is wonderful as long as it recognizes an old curmudgeon such as I.  Great product and works better than I expected."
173,592,2,"I was really hoping this would work! We have a springtime invasion of very tiny black ants. They are particularly attracted to the kitchen sink, probably as a source of water.When they showed up this spring I immediately put out some diatomaceous earth. It didn't stop them so I ordered this Terro product. It's supposed to be fairly safe to use but the instructions said to wear gloves when applying. I didn't own appropriate gloves so I had to buy some. Then I sprinkled the bait around the foundation of the house. It was barely enough.It's supposed to start working in a few days and at first I thought it might be doing something because there seemed to be a decrease in numbers of ants. However, three weeks later we still have ants! Every morning I see a bunch of them in the kitchen sink and on the backsplash, plus a few near the dog's dish and a couple in the bathroom. Today I saw hundreds in the outdoor garbage can even though it stands only a foot from the wall where I applied the bait.This product is borate-based so it is a derivative of boric acid. Boric acid is considered safer than many pesticides, although it still carries risks. According to Wikipedia, it is ""poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities."" In this ant bait, the borate appears to be coated with something so it is not as likely to be inhaled as plain boric acid powder is. I assume the coating is supposed to be tasty to ants. Perhaps our ants are picky eaters because they are still alive."
856,844,3,"A good concept; however, a coupke of issues that I noted. The fan and light will turn on even if you reposition the unit. The white light tend to attract more bugs then it prevents. Coverage area is minimal and did not stop mosquitos from attacking under the table. Would proably need two of these units on the patio. One on the table and one on the ground. Not able to run the light separate from the fan."
897,265,5,"I found this to be, like other Gilmour products I have owned, of high quality.  Later on, I bought a 5/8&#34; version (which I have reviewed), and found it, likewise, a well-made piece of lawn-care equipment."
665,542,4,"We live like mountain goats.  And our lawn is pitched at an angle steep enough that a riding mower would be at risk of tipping.  As a result, we've always used a large self-propelled mower for most of the lawn.  There are certain very steep and tightly confined areas, though, where the heavier self-propelled mower doesn't work...it's simply too heavy to maneuver while trying to keep oneself upright in that steep terrain (I think I need one leg shorter than the other).  So for those areas, we've always kept a cheap lightweight push mower.  We've gone through a bunch of them, but always just replace them with the cheapest thing we can find -- usually in the $150 range.Because these cheap push mowers usually feel like I'm pushing a sled uphill rather than something with wheels, I decided to take time to do some online research for the easiest mower to push...basically which brand and model ""rolls"" the best.  I checked a number of sites and looked for unbiased reviews.  The mower that was repeatedly highlighted for ""easy pushing"" was this Husqvarna 7021P because of its ball-bearing wheels.  I decided to give it a try...and am glad I did.Before I get to the other qualities of this mower, let me first say that this baby ROLLS.  While I definitely wanted a dependable mower that cuts well, my primary reason for buying this mower was for ease of pushing.  And it delivers completely in that area.  On our few flat stretches of lawn, this Husqvarna rolls so easily that it almost feels like a self-propelled model. With its double-ball-bearing wheels, it even rolls more easily over steep and rough terrain.  Its light weight (55 lbs) and extra-large back wheels make it easier to maneuver in tight, steep spots.It starts up easily and has a solid, dependable four-stroke Honda engine.  Its compact design features three cutting systems: bag collection, mulch, and side discharge.  The control bar (which runs the length of the handle) must be pulled back for the engine to run and the blades to turn. For safety, as soon as the control bar is released, a brake stops the blades from spinning and immediately shuts the engine off.  A lever on each of the wheels adjusts the cutting height from 1.25 to 3.42 inches. The handle has two height adjustments.The only issue I had with ours isn't a biggie for me.  The bag for grass collection fits easily enough, but it tends to clog up when it's barely a third full.  Since I generally go ""bagless"" and just mulch our grass, this isn't an issue for us.  While the mower doesn't appear to be of the highest, most-durable construction, I think this is how it manages to be so lightweight for a 21-inch mower.  I'll update this review if I notice it not holding up due to poor construction.While Amazon's price was slightly better than my local home improvement store, I decided not to buy it from Amazon since I would be unable to return it directly to Amazon if there was a problem with it.  I spoke with an Amazon rep and was told that I'd have to deal directly with the manufacturer once it arrived.  I believe that is Amazon's policy on any products that would be gasoline filled.4.5 stars -- highly recommended"
1518,101,5,"Okay, first for Amazon itself:  What a great place to shop!  I've shopped Amazon for years and have always been extremely satisfied with Amazon's service - quality, value and so far, perfect customer service.UPDATE:I've had and used the trimmer for a few months and have found that after using and recharging the batteries a few times, the batteries seem to last a little longer between charges.  Still works great and I feel safe in saying that this is a good, if not excellent buy (still can't say it is a ""Hog"").Now for the Trimmer.This is a replacement for a gas powered trimmer and so far, it really works well.  I said the trimmer rated a ""qualified"" 5 stars, and here are the caveats:1.  To call this trimmer a ""Grass Hog"" is stretching the truth.  It's more like a grass piglet; but for me, with a small yard, it works great.  However, if you have a really large yard, it may not be what you want.  Having had to wait to receive the trimmer, I had a patch of grass (about 2'x8')that grew to about 6"" or 8"" in height, and really seemed to drag the battery down quickly - fortunately it comes with two batteries.2.  The automatic string feature is nice, but it seems to use way more string than necessary, especially when trimming the curb, sidewalk and driveway (sounded like it was continually feeding string).  Again, for a small yard, it works nicely, but if you have a really large yard, just know it isn't a ""HOG"" and will very likely run out of string quickly.Other than those two caveats, it seems to be, for the price, a great little trimmer, and doesn't pollute the atmosphere.  It doesn't require lots of pulling on a starter rope (along with the associated language necessary to start a stubborn gas trimmer), is fairly well balanced,  light, almost noiseless and really, a joy to use."
867,622,5,"For years my wife and I have had problems with snails in our area. Every time we try to grow garden inevitably the snails show up and eat it; not to mention especially after rains the snails seem to be out and about moving around slowly and you end up stepping on them which is pretty gross. We've been hesitant to use any kind of poisons in the yard because our dogs are able to go back there through their doggie door. I was always afraid they would eat some and get sick.This product is all natural and says it's safe for pets. That's the biggest selling point for us, of course, so long as it works. We started putting it down a couple weeks ago and I haven't seen any snail sense. I also haven't seen any snail bodies, which is definitely an added bonus. The information on the product says that it will poison the snails in such a way that they will retreat to their layers to die; as best I can tell it's acting as advertised.I also like the we didn't even need to use that much of it. I don't think we even used the full amount they suggested and it seemed to work well. Not sure there is much else to say about this product, just that if you have a garden you might want to give it a try because it does work really well."
783,176,5,"This is a good Tool, I use it on a job and it worked just great.  The steel handle is much better that wood."
501,848,5,"I'm a big fan of wireless thermometers for the BBQ and smoker, and have been using the Oregon Scientific talking thermometer for years. However, this thermometer has an important and very useful feature: two temperature probes, so I can track the temp of both the meat and the smoker.That's a huge plus, especially when I'm using the smoker when it's cold out (such as now). Even though I use the smoker in an outdoor enclosed area to eliminate (as best as possible) the impact of the wind and wrap the smoker with an insulating jacket, temperature fluctuations are inevitable. I can now see the temp of the smoker itself so I don't have to guess as to whether it is keeping up with the heat loss due to the cold weather.As with any remote thermometer setup can be a bit fiddly. Getting the remote to pair with the receiver is always the sticking point, and this was no exception. If the process does not seem to work, I find that taking out the batteries and resetting it tends to do the trick. The probe jack also needs to be seated firmly - give it a good push and twist to make sure it's making good contact.Again as with any remote temp, the probes are the weak link. These appear to be decently made, but they are always the first point of failure (I'm on my third probe for the Oregon Scientific). To extend their life wash them carefully and don't immerse in water. So far these have worked fine - finger's crossed that will continue.It uses AA batteries for the receiver and transmitter which are included. No problems with range - I was able to maintain a connection when I was inside the house with the smoker outside without any drops.The numbers on the handheld units are clear and easy to read. It does not speak like the Oregon Scientific, but I've always found that to be a gimmick that gets annoying real fast. A simple display and beep is all that is needed.Very pleased with this. I'll update the review should there be any problems with the probe down the road.[Manufacturer provided product for review]"
1393,778,5,"First, shipped well packed and quick.  Second, it looks great, better than the photo on AZ.  Third, it has some features I didn't find on more expensive feeders, i.e. the coated cable that holds it goes through the top and then is anchored to the metal base.  I had one this feeder replaced where the cable was just to a bar stuck through the sides of the plastic of the feeder.  The plastic just gave out, the feeder fell and now is in the junk.  Another nice feature is the little button on the beautifully polished copper top which you push and hold to lift off the top and once filled, slide the top back down securely on the plastic portion to lock it.  Well made all the way.  Also like that the seed passes through several ports into the perch mounted feeder tray rather than just spilling into it.  I think this will really cut down the spillage.  Very pleased.  Oh, btw.  Somebody mentioned in another feeder review that you could douse the seed with pepper and oil to deter squirrels.  That's too much bother.  Just get the cheapest economy size container of cayenne pepper you can find and just liberally sprinkle it over your seed when you get it.  Mix it in (maybe sneeze a couple of times) and with this stuff mixed through your seed, no more squirrels.  I've seen a squirrel hit one of my feeders, must have got a snoot full of pepper and down he went, rubbing his head on the grass trying to relieve his 'burn'.  It doesn't hurt the squirrel but he's finished with your feeder (he'll tell his friends) and it's actually good for the birds who don't seem to mind the pepper at all. As long as your feeders are kept well laced with cayenne, you don't need fancy squirrel baffles."
133,729,3,I'm kind of disappointed in this product. I had high expectations for it but it just didn't seem to make a noticeable dent on the water / mildew stains on the wooden eaves area under the gutters.  We live with fairly high humidity for three seasons of the year and while some of the dirt came off I'm not convinced it was due to the krud kutter solution.
1506,371,5,"As with all things Weber, these pans serve a great purpose and were well designed as part of the Genesis (and other I believe) series grills. It makes it extremely easy to clean the drip pan and all the grease that pools at the bottom. A pack of 10 should last you for a few years. I change mine about 2-3 times a year and I grill at least once a week. For the cost, it is well worth picking these up."
835,580,4,"It took me a while to write this review because I had to wait until our bushes grew to the point of needing a good trimming.  Well, I waited plenty long because I gave this trimmer a good workout.  Here's what I liked:1.)  I like that I don't have to worry about accidentally nicking the electric cord as I did several times on my other hedge trimmer.  It's got several places where I had to wrap black electrical tape around it.2.)  Light weight enough that I (female) can use it without it killing my arms.  I have some tall shrubs and I had to lift the trimmer almost over my head to cut them back.3.)  It cuts very good.  The blade is sharp and long enough, and the motor is powerful enough to cut through some thicker stems ~ around 1/4"" in diameter.4.)  The battery lasted right at an hour.  Although it says it will run for 2 hours it probably will if there isn't any stress on the motor to actually cut something.  I was able to do a great deal of serious hedge trimming within an hour.The only thing I didn't like and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the safety button has to be pressed the entire time with your thumb while cutting or else the trimmer won't work.  My hand got very tired of having to keep the button depressed the entire time.  Next time I'm just going to keep it pressed with duct tape."
889,331,1,"Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me."
226,924,4,"Nice little feeder  roughly a foot high for smaller birds. This is flat back feeder designed especially to hang against a wall of fence but can be mounted on a post as well. Two different hanging options on the back, both make the feeder easy to remove and clean. The lid is hinged for easy filling, there really is no assembly required other than hanging/mounting."
1262,579,5,"I have been switching to non-gas powered tools for years not just because they are ""environmentally friendly"" but for several reasons: they don't stink, I don't have to buy gas, they are quieter, don't run when sitting idle, and are less to maintain. The 24 volt B&D; trimmer fits the bill.What I likeIt feels sturdy. The shaft is aluminum and the rest is a sturdy plastic. I have the 18 volt which has lasted for years. I haven't dropped it off the roof but probably never will.Handle is easily adjustable with the included allen wrench. While the 18 volt has a simple knob to loosen the handle, the allen wrench on this one is attached so it is always with the unit and only takes a minute to loosen it up and adjust it. I doubt it will be changed that often - I never did change my old one. The handle is also secure so that it can't turn, it only slides up and down.Switching from trimming to edging is very easy. You simply push a button and turn the motor end of the unit.The telescoping shaft is easy to adjust the length of the unit. Just loosen and extend or shorten it.Quiet. The only noise is the sound of the cutting line. Nothing you can do about that.Power Command feature. The unit runs very well normally for what I use it for so I don't know what Boost mode would be used for unless you trim trees or something. It definitely gives it a boost.What is really cool is that the 18 volt batteries on my old one work on this one too! So now I have 3 batteries. I doubt I will run out of juice.What I don't likeActually there really isn't anything I don't like about it. Some may be concerned about the weight, although it is going to be less than a gas powered model. The battery life may be a concern but I haven't run out yet. We'll see how things grow this summer but since I have 3 batteries (2 from my old unit) I shouldn't have a problem!Highly recommend this unit."
877,243,3,This is a pretty chintzy product.  First it arrived in pieces due to poor packaging.  The windows are flimsy plastic that do not fit all that well as two of them came out during shipping.  Easily put back in place however they all rattle.  The feeding wells are not well designed.  This was $20 and it is perhaps worth $10.  You need to look for something better and/or less expensive as this one is not a very good value.
431,778,5,"Squeeze a knob at the top and lift the cover, pour in the seeds, and slide the cover back down the wire. Voila, refill done!The birds in our yard are having a blast at this feeder."

772,195,5,I hide this rake in my greenhouse so no one else in my house takes it and I always know where it is. It's the only one I want to use. I love this rake. I can use it for whatever raking job I need to do because I can change the size of the rake head so quickly. Plus this isn't expensive!
1054,897,3,"I filled this with sunflower seeds (peanuts are the only other bird food this will hold). Still some fell out through the mesh onto the ground. The birds flocked to this like crazy, but I saw a small wren get its foot caught in the mesh - it eventually freed itself and flew off but I worried the same thing would happen again - or probably something worse and I don't want to hurt any innocent birds.I emptied the seeds into a large pan to be set out for the birds, cleaned the feeder, and filled it with moss the best I could, stuffing it down with a stick, and hot-glued the stems of silk flowers poked into the moss. Perky-Pet needs to redesign this so it won't be dangerous to wildlife. In the meantime, it will look nice on my patio as soon as the weather warms up."
657,849,3,"First things first, let's highlight the words &#34;maximum durability against squirrels&#34; in the product description.  By maximum durability, I can only assume that they mean that the squirrels won't damage the feeder, because they certainly like to get at the seed within.  That's okay, I figure that the squirrels probably need food too, and hanging around the feeder certainly makes them a little more vulnerable to the passing hawk (it's a circle of life thing, you know?).Anyway, the feeder fills easily enough and the perches are bird friendly.  And I suspect that this will also withstand the marauding deer that visit my feeders in the summer as well."
175,924,2,"This is not a very good bird feeder.  First of all, the top has no latch to keep closed - it just pivots open.  Any squirrel can open this easily and just eat from the top.  Also, not clear from the photo - this is not a cylander.  It has a flat back for mounting on a wall or post (which is what the description says) - but the photo made this unclear.My big knock on this (only two stars) is because of the top mechanism."
171,375,5,So easy to install and perfect for the grill.  Open the grill and the light goes on automatically.  Love it.  I believe you can shut it off too if you don't want it to go on automatically.  Just turn it on yourself.
978,937,5,"Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time, good job. The Liberty Garden 710 Navigator Garden Hose Reel is definitely an upgrade up from my old plastic reel system, which I really loved as well since it lasted for 12 years or so. Installation was a bit tricky, but I reeled through it (pun intended). I bought a new hose to use with it that was much shorter than my old hose, and more flexible, and in the long run I think this was a great decision on my hand and future buyers should do. I like the little shelf on top as well, as I place my other hose accessories on it, as well as my watering can. Yes, it has no lock and will droop unless you place the hose nozzle up top, but that is no biggie. Overall, I see this lasting many years, and its a great investment at the price level, so I recommend it to all."
1242,912,5,"I have been using the previous model of this grill for the last 4 years.  It has been 100% reliable, cooks great, it's easy to move in and out of the garage, all around awesome.I was excited to get this grill and try the latest and greatest, this grill has not disappointed.  It arrives in a very large box, you'll need 2 people to move it.  Assembly was straight forward, and everything went together easily.I've used it a couple of times, it's been cold since I received it, so it will be getting much more use when the weather improves.The grill started easily, I pre-heat for 10 minutes or so before adding food.  I've cooked steaks and chicken on it so far.  It cooks easily,  and uniformly, and tastes great.  Make sure you use the drip pan to avoid a mess.  They don't need to be replaced very often, and are easy to find online or at box stores.It's roomy enough to cook steaks or chicken breasts ( the big Costco ones) for about 4 people.  If you are grilling hamburgers or hot dogs, it can certainly entertain more people.All in all another great grill from Weber.  They cook great, are compact, and reliable."
1146,858,5,"i used this on my pressurewasher that has a 9 horse honda motor.  it is a good basic kit.  the air filter did not fit but i can adapt it to another motor i have.  the plug did not fit but again i can adapt that to another motor.  like i said it is a good basic kit probably for the 5 horse honda motor.  but check the numbers for the parts in the kit 1st before installing to see if the plug, air filter are what is suggested."
646,871,5,"We had a mishap removing the pool cover for the season last week. The darn thing rolled out from under us and dumped a good bit of dirty water and leaves into the pool. It took a lot of work, but the pool is looking great today and a lot of that must be due to this pool enzyme. I am very pleased with how well it worked and the fact that it is a natural product. Highly recommend."
604,958,4,"this is a light weight cover, so by the end of the year we will be able to tell how well it did its job throughout the summer. it is big enough to adequately cover the grill. its light weight makes it easy to maneuver, fold up and put away when the grill is in use."
444,715,3,"I've only tried these outside, as I have pets inside and I don't want the mice to eat the bait and then die in the house, and then risk my dogs messing around with poison dead mice.The mice that were rooting around in my garden seem to be gone, so I guess it's been working.The Tier 1 station means you can keep the plastic bait house - which is secure enough that pets can't get in, and replace the bait brick.  Frankly, I don't really want to be handling the poison bait - so I plan to throw the whole thing away when the bait is chewed up.And the only benefit over snap traps is being able to set it and forget it and not have to deal with the dead mice after."
652,262,2,"I have tried using this griddle to prepare several different types of dishes, but I have yet to have a single dish that did not stick to the griddle and make a mess. And since you can only hand wash it, the mess is even more a problem to remove.As one of the other reviews said, this is better used as a serving dish or the keep food warm, I cannot recommend this griddle as cookware."
293,807,3,"I have a large multi-story house and the air-conditioning/heating has a hard time getting to a couple of remote rooms.  This generally calls for a booster fan to assist in the distance that the conditioned air needs to travel so I ordered this unit.  Here is what I liked:1.  The unit is a very simple construction that consists of a 6 inch wide piece of metal ducting that is 7 inches long. The ducting is configured to join two pieces of metal ducting with one flared end and one ribbed end.  The fan is mounted in the middle of the unit and the cord exits the unit with a three prong plug at the end of about 5 feet of cord.2.  The unit does move a good volume of air.3.  The motor unit is supposed to be sealed so it should not need servicing during its life span.What I did not like:1.  The fan is just that, a constant running fan.  There is no air flow sensor so unless you want this running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week you need to wire an outlet that is controlled by your air handling system.2.  The fan unit in mine made a god awful racket when it was plugged in.  Turns out that the mounting screws were very loose and allowed the fan blade to contact the metal housing.  The nuts that they used have ribs to prevent it from coming loose, but they do NOT do a good job of that.  They came loose within a few minutes of running.  I added shake washers to it and then it worked just fine.3.  This unit also presumes that you have a 7 inch section of metal pipe missing from your ducting.  If you have flexible ducting or you have long lengths of metal ducting you will need to modify your ducting to accept this unit!!!As long as you are aware that you are going to need to modify your ducting and install a control unit to turn this on and off with your heating/air-conditioning system, and you install shake washers to hold the fan in place, then this is a decent unit.I would recommend this unit as long as you understand the above caveats."
797,878,3,"Pros:- You don't need to touch the dead rat- Looks good...Cons:- Silver scary? We haven't caught anything- In the instructions it specifically says never to use rechargeable batteries. I really don't like wasting or throwing away batteries so I have a bunch of rechargeables. Well, this product specifically says not to use them. It also recommends against using regular batteries, only fancy alkaline ones (names on subset of energizer batteries as the best)I'm going to try it for a little longer before making up my mind, for now, I am giving it 3 stars, but it's trending down, unless the critter gets caught."
51,208,3,"My soil is very hard and has a high clay content.  As a result, I have extremely poor drainage.  I sometimes get my lawn professionally aerated, but didn't this year.  I thought I'd give this tool a try.Important to note is that truly aerated the soil means taking out plugs of soil, to actually leave little holes, which helps to loosen the soil and give it better drainage.  This is not taking plugs out of the soil -- it is basically poking holes into it, and in some ways it is compacting the soil.  The angle of the handle on this is good, and it's easy enough to use...however, I notice a huge difference between what this tool does for my soil and what an actual aerator does for it...no comparison really."
312,255,1,"Well, I bought two of these and used as directed, and the moles just continued to destroy my yard.  Save your $10 after shipping and get rid of your yard's grubworms."
1060,122,5,I use earthworm castings to feed my plants and to provide some free earthworms that seem to come with the product.  I guess there's eggs in the sack.  I also use castings to spread around the base of any plant that's having white fly trouble.  Seems the flies don't like castings and so they leave.  I add a few cup-fulls of castings to each potted plant too.
983,871,5,"I like using orb-3 products, and this is one of their better products a pool enzyme that breaks up the organic matter. Between the algae growth and new pollen growth our pool was a disaster.  This pro duct came just in time. Now our water looks awesome."
742,517,5,Perfect if you don't have the room and very attractive. I love it and have had a lot of compliments.
1493,797,5,"I have purchased the red and the blue of this feeder and like the  look and the ability to put thru the dishwasher.they are sturdy and the color in the sun is very pretty in the yard. Plastic is being phased out of my home..recycling is not being done and the oceans and landfills  are choking with the junk. We need to think too that plastic no matter what they say, is toxicand we need to think of not exposing the hummingbirds to it nor the foolish belief that recycling is being done properly. SO this is why I purchased them and am very happy with the purchase!"
131,683,5,These are great.  They've already made a difference with what I'm using them for.  I would definitely recommend this product.
1008,524,4,"Perky-Pet makes a fine product.  Ask any of the 10 or so visitors we have each year.  Wait you cannot do that now since most of them have made their way back to Mexico to enjoy their summer.  Come spring time, however, there will be constant visits to the 6 stations and soon to be 7 or more.  I cannot tell if they will like this iteration of a hummer feeder due to receiving it when there is no traffic for them here, but the Perky-Pet products that hang during the season we should be refilling this one as often as the others.Upon arrival I noticed several issues that could be a problem during that season.  The plastic material used for the liquid might not be suitable for them unless it is a plastic that they like.  Sounds weird, I know, but some of the previous plastic containers were not suitable for this batch of hummers and ended up in the land fill.  The top fill may or may not be of value.  I'll address that issue in the spring but for now it is not of significance since all the others are bottom filled.  The 4 foot stands on the bottom of the feeder are at first glance fragile unless built of a stronger plastic.  Even though the normal hummer's weight is slight and in the one to two gram size, the constant use might render the foot stand useless.  They do not care, however.  Even when the foot stands are in tact some prefer to hover when feeding.Regardless of any unknown factors, they will be back in the spring and at that time I will upgrade this review with facts and not assumptions based on many years of use."
1511,349,4,"My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest."
340,319,5,With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
366,820,1,"This is over $200 and I'd say it's worth, maybe $49 to $79. Even then, I'd look for a better product in any price range. It was easy enough to put together, even for me, but when I put it on it's feet it was so not substantial. It reminds me of these super cheap bar stools we got once...no one ever sat in them because they just felt cheap and wobbly.When I read that I could not use this on my deck, I was even more disappointed. You have to drag it out into the yard to use it, where I already have a nice, sturdy, rock fire pit. In the grass it was a little less tippy, but all-in-all I'd pass on this one. I had one fire in it and kept the hose very close-by in case it just crashed to the ground. I am going to let it air out a bit and use it on my deck, filling it with flowers."
1412,373,4,"Container is smaller than I anticipated.  While it is certainly large enough for everyday saucing needs of the normal amount of feedings, larger parties with a loaded grill need something bigger.  Words of caution, not negative remarks.Secondly, I think a glass container would have been much nicer and have more longevity.  I often use a Pyrex measuring cup for saucing purposes.  What they lack is place to lay down the utensil without making a mess or risking a tip over.  This Weber container picks up on the Pyrex's shortcomings.  Just a suggestion.The silicone basting brush is nice.  Not too long and touristy looking but not too short that your burn your arms.I would purchase again.  Quality of the brush itself makes it worth a solo purchase to have a few on hand for other duties besides the grill basting."
1390,440,5,I was crazy about my new house -- until the ants came marching in. I couldn't believe it when I  saw hundreds trailing along the woodwork toward my kitchen cabinets. I mean that: hundreds. Someone told me about Terro. I had it in place for only a couple of days when presto! -- the ants disappeared. I've never been bothered again. I put out the Terro every year just in case. I also use the outdoor version of this product on my wood deck.
1527,251,5,"This product works well. Kills insects and simple to use. Convenient squirt tip.Contains nontoxic Diatomaceous Earth, which is ground sedimentary rock that contains many diatoms. It's an abrasive powder, and it kills insects by scratching their exoskeletons."
1533,182,5,"I got this to catch squirrels that were getting into my attic.  Took it out of the box, baited it with peanut butter placed in a bottle cap (to keep the trap clean) and caught a huge rat that night.  The result was no more noise in the attic.  I shot the squirrel later.I know that some people will object to shooting varmints.  Well, to each his own.  But one thing I like about this trap is that you can shoot whatever you capture with a .22 and you don't have to worry about damaging the trap.  A little rinse from the garden hose and all the evidence is gone. The galvanized metal construction means you don't have to worry about rust.  Get a bigger one for cats.  Shoot, shovel, and shut up."
32,876,4,This is a very good grill brush. It cleaned the grill quite well. I like the long handle and the bristles were a pleasant change from the wire bristle brushes on the market (those bristles can come off and be deadly). I might suggest that they make the bristles a little longer as some grill grates are thicker. The cost is reasonable and the brush works great. I received the product free of charge for my honest opinion (no compensation).
1539,22,3,This product is well made and works well; however attempting to clean both the bottle and the base is very difficult. The base is sealed and with many small hard to reach spaces inside I can't see how it can be cleaned. The neck of the bottle is very narrow. Even with a bottle brush it's hard to reach all the area inside.
1145,10,5,"I love hearing the zap zap zap.  Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now, and left it out to brave quite a few storms, and it's still going on strong."
1407,954,5,"We received a 'for review' pair but there were no under the table deals involving a 'good review' in exchange.These are great gloves for as long as your hands are not very large or excessively hairy - the silicone would unpleasantly pull your hairs when putting them in or while taking them out. In my case, they fit just right. There was a little bit of hair-pulling but it didn't cross into pain territory. Once on, the are just great for barbecue, grill and oven-related activities. The silicone gets you good heat protection and the little hearts pattern provide a good grip so your hands won't be burned and it's not likely that you are going to drop your pot roast on your feet and make a mess.It's five stars for as long as your hands are not very large or excessively hairy."
1344,228,4,"We had one that was more plain before but it just got all beat up and wasn't pleasant to use.  This one is much more sturdy and I love that it includes a cover.  The tiling is a nice feature as well.  Overall, it is a very nice fire pit."
1657,93,5,"This trap worked great and caught the mouse the first night I put it out. I was then able to release it easily in a nearby field. I have tried many other catch and release traps and the Havahart models seem to always work the best for me. I have used them to catch mostly mice and voles, but I would imagine they all work just as good for catch and release pest control."
592,75,5,I'm a beginner gardener even though I've been a home owner for 11 years. I've always had a yard guy and never liked it much. I decided to get into it this year and have had a good time cleaning up my backyard. This trowel is lightweight and strong and I would recommend it.
123,722,3,"When I pulled the Garden Genious out of the box, my spouse took one look and said ""why did you buy a buffing pad?"". Indeed, this looks like a small version of the buffing pads used to polish floors on commercial machines...in fact, it feels like one too. Heck, it even smells a bit like one. Since it's made by 3M, I'm really not sure it isn't a repurposed use for a common commercial quality floor machine so I quickly turned to the packaging to search for what this is made from...nothing. I turned the other side, no information.Now, I like to garden but don't consider myself a purist by any stretch of the imagination. I routinely use petro based fertilizers (don't neg me about it!) and will even resort to pesticides when needed. However, over the years I have become a bit more conservative regarding what I put on plants as well as the soil. I've invested a considerable sum into purchasing decent soil since my yard was basically fill dirt/sand. My pots are carefully cultivated with good soil, compost, little worms etc...essentially, I want to know what something is made out of before using it. Not a clue after reading the packaging.If you are like me, perhaps you are sick and tired of companies making a buck by repurposing commercial waste products for consumer use or simply assuming you will buy anything without wanting to know what it is made out of. If that is the case, skip this one until the manufacturer provides some basic information.If you are like I was a few years ago and don't care less about what anything is made out of then save some money and simply go ask any floor maintenance company for the inserts/middle section of the scrubbing/buffing pads used on those big walk behind machines. It will do the same as this (might even be the exact same thing) for a lot less money.If you like to spend premium dollar for a product that doesn't bother to tell you anything about it and appears to be a repurposed product from a throw-away of another product...buy this!"
863,237,3,"I honestly don't know if this bait works. So perhaps I should not even be writing a review, but at least I'm being honest. I find a few tunnel holes in the backyard but have never seen moles, so I may not even have any. We do have small roof mice here in Arizona. They tend to feed on the backyard oranges & grapefruit that have fallen to the ground. But, since placing this bait out I have seen no dead ones, so I really don't know if this bait is working, at least on them."
1499,9,5,"It took many years for my Black and Decker Gross Hog trimmer to use up all of its string.  Changing the empty string spool was a snap, and the new one works perfectly, just as I would expect.  No complaints."
660,134,4,"These work for the purpose I bought them, but what a pain to have to run to the store and buy washers for them.  I bought five of them."
610,614,3,"I haven't used these yet, but soon will and will update this review when I do. They seem durable, but not thick as I expected them to be. Not sure they'll do the job with roses as I hope, but will soon see and let you know.Overall, we'll have to wait and see."
662,221,5,This spinning head coupled to a pressure washer does the job 5 times faster than the wand only.  Bought it to clean our concrete pool deck each spring.  Works like a charm.  Then used it to clean our presssure treated deck to reseal it.  Works real well for that too.  Finally used it to clean our asphalt driveway.  So much faster than just the wand.
503,384,5,"This brush gets the job done. It is very strong and is easy to use. The bristles are secure in the head of the brush, they do not fall out like the cheepie brushes. The nice leather hanger is perfect for hanging on the side of the grill. This is a must have for all grillers."
453,88,4,"All trimmers are like writers, they need good lines. The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars!"
339,897,1,"I loved the thought of this feeder when I first saw it.  I own quite a few Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders, so brand wise, it was a good choice for me.  But, it was all down hill from there.First off, so much BOSS falls through the bottom while filling.  Next, once the squirrels get a whiff, hang on it, do the hokey pokey and turn themselves around, the BOSS gets flung all over the place, to the hoard of squirrels waiting below.Finally, towards dusk, when the squirrels were tucking themselves into their nests, the cardinals came to investigate.  I was horrified to see a female get her claw stuck in it.  All her flapping around was stressful to us both.  I went over with the leather gloves and a towel, but by the time I got there, she probably broke her foot so that I wouldn't get her!  I took it down immediately.Should be starless!"
885,153,5,This is an excellent digging tool. I have one other with a matte blade which I have used for years. This knife has depth markers incised into the shiny stainless steel blade which help with determining the depth to dig for various bulbs and corms. It also has one jagged blade which helps when you have to cut a root.
537,76,5,Carrie it in every time i go in my grow room.Always a need to manicure and get all dead and unwanted branchs and leaves...Has tons of pockets to store whatever i need and my trash bucket.Makes things a lot easier and cleaner love it
1644,550,2,"This time of year is harvest time.  That means various things.  There are many vegetables that pass through our kitchen.  There is a lot of chopping, cooking, canning, and preserving going on.  In addition to that whole scenario, there is one more thing that is almost overwhelming at times- FRUIT FLIES.The Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap seemed like a godsend.  I could not wait to use it.  I was disappointed, however, when I saw that you get this little plastic apple like thing, and inside is a wick.  There is a little squeeze bottle of oil that you put in the plastic apple and the idea is that you leave it standing upright in a place where the flies are and let it attract them.  They stay trapped inside and can not reproduce.PROSThis does attract a lot of fliesIt is non-toxicIt is small to put in handy placesDoes trap fruit fliesCONSIs one time use onlyCan be tipped over easilyWastefulNeed to have a LOT of them to be effectiveIf these were re-useable, I would get them again for sure.  I don't think they are cost effective, however, and don't like the fact that you have to keep throwing them away and use a lot of them to keep fruit flies down especially during harvest time.I only have one, and it has put a very slight dent in our fruit fly population, which means I would need a LOT of them to truly work.  This is fine if you have occasional flare ups of fruit flies.  If you have a bigger problem, however, they are not practical or cost effective, I don't think."
706,559,5,Easy to apply to specific areas of concern. I am not completely sure of its effectiveness yet but Combat has a great reputation and so I'm sure that it will work.
835,874,2,"I'm a gardener and for the last several years I have been practicing the ""art"" of gardening with varying degrees of success.  I buy heirloom seed and raise my seedlings before planting which for me, is fun but still work.  I wanted to try out these seed cups by Miracle-Gro and so far I kind of like them. I won't be changing to these from what I've been doing, but for someone who has a very small area to grow vegetables/herbs or just want a small patio garden I think this is a great way to accomplish that.You won't be raising a large garden with numerous plants of each kind, but you will get a small sampling of some fairly popular vegetable garden plants.  I'm sure the seed used in these seed cups are NOT heirloom, so I wouldn't bother trying to save any to use the following year because they most likely will not produce any vegetables.  Plants yes, but no produce.  And I wouldn't mix them with plants that are heirloom if you're planning on saving any seeds because they will cross pollinate and could sabotage your heirlooms.However, for children, school classroom projects, or the micro gardener I think these are perfect.  They are very easy to plant, I just made a small hole in one of my raised beds and pushed the entire container into it after peeling off the lid. Sprinkle with some water and wait.  It's too early yet to report on the quality of the produce, but so far I have only planted the herbs. I already have a lot of the other type plants growing and don't want to risk cross pollination. I always get excited when I see the new plant babies breaking the surface of the soil - never gets old for me!I'm looking forward to some fresh herbs though, and each seed cup will produce several seedlings.  I don't like to waste seedlings so I carefully separate them and replant.  Most people will choose one or two of the healthiest seedlings and discard the remaining ones, but I like to give everybody a chance if I have the room.  I think these seed cups are an excellent way to introduce gardening to children and for those who just want to start out with something very easy and not much of it.  Some plant food granules are included along with very good instructions.4.19.14 UPDATEThe plant pots I planted never amounted to anything, and this year while getting my raised bed ready for new plantings I found a pot I planted from last year with it's seeds still in it, buried underneath the soil that didn't germinate.  The pot didn't even decay much.  I wouldn't waste my money on these things but buy fresh seeds instead or seedlings that have already been started. I have a few more pots left over and I'll try them again somewhere in the garden, but I'm not expecting them to do anything."
87,268,5,"First I want to thank all the Weber owners who reviewed here.  This cover is fantastic.As others have alluded, the Weber covers are what best can be described as an afterthought.These Veranda covers are the exact opposite - High quality materials, high quality workmanship, functional design, attractive and durable.The only negative is that the large size (64in) is about 2 inches shorter than the OEM Summit series 400 cover.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I expect it to last as long as multiple Weber covers.  Happy grilling!"
1309,446,5,I tilled the hill on my backyard and I have some ground cover plants on it now.  I was really worried that it would rain hard before the ground cover could prevent soil erosion.  I decided to spray this on to my plants to speed up the growing process.  It worked.  Not only did it work on the ground cover but the flowers in the flower bed also started to bloom and it looks great.  I use it once a week to keep it growing faster.  Excellent product.
405,595,3,"The price was excellent.  The weight and hadling of this piece of equipment was extremely easy as was its assembly and my ability to operate it.  Maybe its my soil, but I was not able to till the soil.  It did remove surface weeds, but tines did not burrow paths into the soil so we had to use a shovel to lift and turn the soil and go over it with the Cultivator.  A bit more work than I'd hoped for.  If your soil is not hard as mine is, this may be great for your projects.  I recommend it for household small flower bed and garden projects. It is not an industrial/landscapers piece of equipment."
240,701,5,"We not only have hordes of tiny ants, we have the tiny biting ants...the ones who crawl up onto your shoe or slipper or bare foot as you are crossing the yard....hateful little buggers.....the little guys who wait until they see dry or canned cat food put down and descend upon it in masses.  The little guys who live to sabotage hummingbird feeders. (I just found an ant trap here on Amazon to use above a hummingbird feeder - keep it filled with water so they drown - and it works amazingly well - just remember to keep it filled with water, especially in hot weather).I was familiar with the name TERRO as we have been using the indoor liquid ant bait traps for yearsTerro PreFilled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits  6 Pack  T300and they work great.  You open one and set it down in their path and they go inside, eat the liquid, carry it back to the colony and the queen and eventually they die.  Sometimes it takes 24 to 36 hours for the procession of ants to eventually end and if it's in a bathroom just close the door from children and pets.  Any other place it might be easier to spray them and kill them on the spot, but that won't stop them from finding another way in.  Use the bait trap and put something over it so it won't be disturbed.  Get as close to their entry way as possible, like up against a baseboard/wall, etc.So, when I saw TERRO had an outside liquid ant bait trap I was eager to try it as spraying does little if any good.  We found some fresh ant hills in the back yard, followed the directions, and while I don't know for certain that we got them all, I do know they are not at that location any longer.  I can only hope that particular colony is no more.I see these are not in stock at Amazon right now, but I would suggest finding them in your vicinity and give them a try.  They worked for us and the inside traps are available here on Amazon and are much cheaper than a Bug/Weed Mart and we have had great success with them as well!"
201,819,4,"When this was offered for late/spring early/summer reviewing, I wondered about the timing. When testing this, I also wondered about what the neighbors were thinking. Then I remembered that they had frequently let me know such, so all was well.Assembly should have been a snap. Unfortunately one of the bolts for the legs was poorly threaded. I had neither the right sized black metric bolt nor the right threading in my tap and die set to rethread the bolt or the hole. So, to put on one of the legs I had to use a bolt I had that was almost right and force it in with some thin metal stock as a shim to make the hole a little smaller. Thus a ten minute assembly took over an hour.This has a very nice appearance and, once assembled, is quite sturdy. The lid fits well enough, though it's circular shape is not quite the same as the circular shape of the bowl. I'm hesitant to put too much force on the lid to change its shape. It does contain the ashes while burning. There is also a vinyl cover for it (when not in use).The grate is sturdy enough, though I would have preferred that the spacing between its bars to have been smaller. It is difficult to use tender to get the fire started without it falling to the bottom of the bowl. I have taken a smaller grate from another grill to go crosswise and it works much better.Overall, this looks nice on the patio, burns well and I'm sure we will use it more often once the appropriate season gets here. Maybe I'll be getting an outdoor fan to review then, too."
362,894,5,"I've been a more of a fan of anvil-type hand pruners rather than the scissors (bypass) type. But these hand pruners have me rethinking that.The problem with scissors/bypass pruners is that the blades tend to move apart over time, and eventually you find you're pinching and folding over woody stems instead of cutting cleanly.I'm confident that won't happen with these shears. They are precision made. You can tell right out of the package that they are top quality. Everything is manufactured to close tolerances, and the materials are high grade. There's no ""slop"" or wiggle in them, just smooth action. I doubt seriously anything is going to get out of alignment, unless someone tries to cut barbed wire with them or something.A few test cuts prove that these are indeed sharp and well aligned shears -- no folding or pinching, just clean, smooth cuts.As for the cork handles, I have a friend who doesn't like to touch unfinished wood. So I asked her to try these out to see how they worked for her. She said they feel more like a rubberized grip than cork, so they are very comfortable for her.Five stars for these pruners. They'll be a favorite of most every gardener and grower."
997,345,5,"Our problem is with moles.  With the soil we have here in SW Washington, this applicator works great and it hasn't jammed on me yet.  Using disposable gloves to load this applicator keeps human scent off the bait.  Very happy to have this applicator, I wasn't aware that something like this even existed."
12,505,5,"This is a great hedge trimmer made by Black and Decker.  The trimmer is quiet and because it is electric, it starts and stops instantly.  The handle is sort of thick so squeezing the trigger and cutting for more than 5 minutes at a time might make your hand cramp (that's what happens to me and I am 200 pounds).  It states it can cut branches 3/4 inch, and it is true.  With enough tenacity, you can cut up to 1 inch branches.  When branches are too thick and get cut in the trimmer, it automatically shuts off.  You then have to unjam it to restart it.Battery life is somewhat decent.  I got about 30 minutes of use out of one battery with a few minutes break in-between.  Highly suggested to have a spare battery charged and ready to go while you are using this.  There is no option to connect a cord to it, only battery.The batteries are interchangeable with other 18 volt B&D; tools, which is a huge plus.  I have the complete set of blower, weed whacker and this trimmer.  If you need a complete set, check out the Lawn Care set.  That comes with a 3 battery charger (3 batteries) and hanging kit to organize the tools.The charger that is supplied with it is a ""dummy"" charger.  It does not know when the battery is full and you have to keep an eye on how long you have had it plugged in.  Recommendations are to not have it charged for more than 8 hours.  I normally charge my battery in the morning and then use it in the afternoon.All in all, this is a great trimmer.  It is silent and powerful.  You can get a lot of work done without worrying about disturbing your neighbors because it makes very little sound.I highly recommend this tool."
1212,677,4,"While I try not to consider price when I am given the opportunity to test and review an item, I was quite intrigued to find out what made an outdoor chair worth the asking price of $349.00.  I jumped at the opportunity to try the Highwood Furniture Adirondack Chair to find out.Assembling the chair was not terribly difficult.  Having two adults definitely made the assembly a bit easier.  With two adults, assembly took us 45 minutes.  A second adult came in handy as in the beginning, assembly required lining up holes on two large pieces (the base and the back) without having anything to rest the pieces on to assist in lining up the holes.  Having the second person allowed one person to hold the chairback in the air while the other person lines up the holes and put the screws in.  A socket set was a huge help when assembling the chair.Once assembled, the chair was quite attractive.  The plastic the chair is made if does take a bit of getting used to.  I keep expecting to get a sliver when I rub against a rough edgeThe king size chair is incredibly roomy.  We have three children (9, 7, and 5) and any two of the kids can sit in the chair side by side comfortably.  At around 5 foot 10 inches and 245 pounds, when I sit in the chair, I have about 9 inches of extra room at my sides.The chair back has 3 adjustment positions.  While the most ""upright"" setting is useable, this setting lacks a bit in comfort.  This position gives me the feeling like I'm being folded in half.  Also, the slightest nudge forward causes the chair to collapse slightly (though the design of the chair prevents the chair from collapsing completely in that direction).  I found the farthest back setting to be the most natural feeling.The chair does fold for transport and storage.  However, the chair really does not fold flat.  When it is in its flattened position, the chair really is not in a convenient shape for storage or transporting.  Folding the chair flat is easy enough.  It is just a matter of folding up the piece that locks the chair into position and lowering the chair back.  However, restoring the chair back to a useable configuration is a bit tricky at first.  The front legs stick straight out when the chair is collapsed and getting the front legs back into their original position is the tough part.  I eventually found that I was able to uncollapse the chair by standing the folded chair upright on its front legs and pushing the bottom of the seat portion of the chair out with my foot to make the front legs swing out a bit.Overall, this chair seems like a fine quality product.  While I do not think this chair is feasible as a portable chair, it does seem to be a nice stationary chair.  This product seems that it would be better suited for a cruise ship than a backyard deck though.  If you are looking for a decent quality, no maintenance chair, this might be one to consider.  The feel of the chair does take a bit of getting used to.Do I feel the chair is worth $350?  Personally, I would not, but my outdoor furniture does not get a lot of use.  However, this chair seems to be a high quality piece (time will tell in this aspect).  If your outdoor furniture sees a high amount of usage and quality is important to you or if there is a larger person who might need the extra space, this chair might be worth a look."
268,102,5,I've got two of these and I really like them since it speeds up the amount of time it takes to get cuttings to root. If they were used on a cooler surface like a concrete or wood surface they'd be perfect as is but running on top of carpet they get a little too warm for my liking. I'm looking into getting some dimmers for them. I saw them on Amazon once so I just need to hunt them down so I can keep these just a little bit cooler.
1045,749,4,"The trimmer is easy to use, and despite warnings against working it too hard, I was able to establish the initial line near the sidewalk pretty easily.  But it did use lots of line in the process!  Now that I use it just to trim up, I can also use the battery to complete the job with the B&D blower too!"
788,789,4,"This is my first fire tub, so I can't speak for its cost worth in comparison to the many lower priced fire pits offered on Amazon. This one seems to be at the higher end of the price spectrum, which I would mostly attribute to the copper (which is on the expensive side at the moment) tub.The fire pit consists of a stand, the copper tub and a metal spark guard. There is also a grate, a poker and a vinyl cover. The tub stand comes in 6 pieces, the four legs and two circular pieces. The tub stand was easily assembled in my living room with 12 screws and the provided, ever present allen wrench. The handle for the spark guard is also assembled using one screw and the allen wrench.The tub is sturdy, but is not so heavy that I can't move it, at least when it's empty. There is no insulation on the tub, so the entire apparatus gets very hot when it is in use. The poker is multi-use and is designed to lift the grate but can also be used to move the wood around inside the tub. The poker does not help with adding wood to the fire; this must be done by hand. The fire pit is not so large, however, that this is a problem.So far I am very happy with this fire pit. It seems sturdy and works well; it is also beautiful. Time will tell how it holds up to use and the elements."

1511,577,1,"The marketing premise is based on the fact that we all think mice are icky and we don't want their germs or their decomposing bodies in our homes. Fair enough. The idea is to catch the mouse with this trap and then toss the whole kit and caboodle in the trash. My husband's initial reaction, upon setting this up, was that throwing out a trap every time you catch a mouse isn't exactly environmentally friendly or easy on the wallet. But as this was a free sample, he agreed to give it a go.Well, now we still have the mouse . . . and the trap . . . minus the peanut butter we used as bait. There are little mouse giggles and peanut butter belches during the night.We will be going back to the traditional style mouse trap asap."

329,923,4,"The Perky-Pet Adjustable Platform Wild Bird Feeder is made by one of the most reliable feeder brands on the market.This model comes with a wire grate on the feeding tray that discourages non-bird predators.  The dome also makes overhead access more difficult, but neither is going to deter a determined - and hungry - squirrel.However, the adjustable dome does allow the owner to select what size birds he feeds.  Ours is set for finches and other small birds, and, after having the process demonstrated by a brave titmouse, the feeder was quickly popular with smaller avians.The smaller opening between tray and dome that we selected does make filling the tray more difficult.  The Wild Birds feeder that this is replacing was much easier to adjust for filling, but it lacked the grate.In summary, this feeder is simple to assemble and will be easy to clean.  It's also easy to adjust for smaller birds.  But the dome isn't as easily adjustable as it could be.  Further, it may slow down the squirrel onslought, but it's unlikely to stop them."
501,99,5,"I love this hedge trimmer!  I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming, but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools.  I had a corded model (also a B&D;) that cut very well, but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something, and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming. Looked into a gas model, but the weight was an issue, as well as the noise.The cordless B&D; is a fantastic tool! It lets you concentrate on the trimming. Ready to go in a second (no cord to unwind and plug in) and the battery lasts a decent interval. No, it's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours, but that's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you're done, you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle. Highly recommend!!"
1362,824,5,"This a extremely well-made grill. Sturdy, very easy to assemble, with excellent materials and finish.It's just the right size. I've entertained parties of 6 to 15 people, easily, grilling red meat, sausages, chicken and even pizza (with a few tricks, it's actually a great way to get a crunch tasty one).I'm from Brazil, and for most of my fellow countryman (including myself) there's no way to grill other than charcoal. I've recently moved to the US and I had no previous experience with Weber products, but I have to say I'm extremely impressed with this grill.I don't have the custom of grilling hamburgers because in my country we barbecue big pieces of red meat, especially alcatra and picanha (special cuts of top sirloin and tenderloin). They are slowly grilled and the results with charcoal are far more superior than gas-grilled ones.Besides, with a good quality charcoal, pieces of newspaper and a lighter, anyone can get a good fire with this grill. I don't even have to use the starter chimney (sold separately). From the nice handles to the thermometer and the ash dispenser (great feature by the way), everything in this grill is good quality.And the price is more than reasonable. I truly recommend this product."
1500,387,4,"This Weber chimney starter was the first one I ever saw or used as my dad used lighter fluid on the coals growing up. This starter worked extremely well each time thus far. Add newspaper to the bottom, fill it up with charcoal, light the paper and place on the grill till they turn grayish-white. The item is sturdy and strong. Two issues: 1) as dumping the charcoals into the grill the handle area is extremely hot and if not done quickly you may require oven mitts while handling, and 2) the u-bar around the handle doesn't seem to provide any additional support when handling a full starter; I'm not sure if this is to help hold on to the unit if wearing oven mitts or what, but it doesn't seem to support holding the unit."
1061,180,5,Birds love this as they are always at this feeder.  Space for lots of birds to get food.  Have made my own suet and birds come.
822,126,3,"One was well packaged and the other not thus the plastic bird banches that stick out one was twisted off,  Both had different tops.  and unsure if they will even survive one season,  Was very disappointed in these,  They look nice but are very cheap"
1260,832,5,"I have a lot of deer living in the woods just behind my neighborhood.  As such, my yard tends to serve as a salad bar for the deer.  I've found that by regular use of deer sprays, and switching brands every year or two, I tend to keep them at bay for the most part.I am a big proponent of using my own mixture as well.  For me it works just as well as the manufactured sprays and costs far less.  The home made stuff does not adhere as well after a rain though, so it does require more frequent applications.This is my first time using Deer B-Gon.  Like most repellents of this sort, the product relies on rotten egg  to deter deer.  Some other brands will also add capsaicin (hot pepper) or garlic.  Deer B-Gon does not include these ingredients, instead adding cinnamon oil and clove oil to its putrescent egg solids.So far, my experience with the product has been very good. I usually buy concentrate instead of ready-made as all deer repellents tend to be expensive.  I tend to like Ortho products for performance and value though, so I tried this ready-to-use mixture.  Plus, it was one less thing to mix when I do my yard work!As mentioned at the start of this review, I do switch brands from season to season.  Here's why: if everyone in your neighborhood goes to the same large store or even local hardware store, they tend to buy the same spray.  This means every shrub in every yard is treated with the same product. The deer eventually are going to eat something, and when they run out of untreated food, or are simply hungry enough, they are going to eat treated vegetation.  So if they wander into 5 yards and 4 smell identical, they may tend to avoid the 5th yard a little longer.  I know this is not a scientific approach, but it is simple and has held true for me for the most part.  Of course during a harsh, cold season, deer will eat even things they rarely touch, sprayed or not.So I rotate between Deer B-Gon, Deer Off and my homemade recipe.  I've included that ""recipe"" below if anyone has interest.As far as the Deer B-Gon, it has a heavy cinnamon smell, which is somewhat pleasing from a few feet away, but when you get close to what you've sprayed, the stuff stinks (which is what you want after all, something the deer dislike).  If you dab some on your fingertip you'll see what I mean.  It smells OK from a couple of feet away, but lift your finger to your nose - oh boy.This product is meant to be applied by attaching a garden hose to the bottle.  I poured about  the bottle into an empty garden sprayer to put is aside, and then attached the hose to the Ortho bottle.  Although you can control the flow for the most part, I wasn't really sure how much of a mixture of the spray and water I would get, so that's why I put some aside.  I tried some of my yard like this, and for the other half of my yard, I added water to the Deer B-Gon I had put aside, about 3 parts water for 1 part Deer B-Gon.  Even watered down, this seemed to apply a little heavier application than by hose, so I was probably wasting some of the product when I didn't use the hose.  I always spray some of my lawn as well as shrubs, usually applying some deer repellent on my grass in the narrower parts of my yard, on each side of my house.The deer seem to avoid the whole yard, so using the product as intended (attaching a hose) appears to be fine. I'll observe them late at night on occasion, and I can see them standing by the lawn, debating whether to come into the yard.  So they do come, but seem to leave the shrubs alone. Of course, one or two alwasy come up for a nibble, but seem to be put off by the taste.To me, a hose application is a little more cumbersome.  A) you need to use a hose and pull it around with you, and B) I don't like the idea of deer spraycoming in contact with the water hose, or the splatter from the hose method.  I like a more controlled spray/mist, so I can stand upwind of the breeze and apply more easily.  Personal preference though.  Others may prefer to use the hose stream, as opposed to battling the wind more with a mist spray.All in all, this is a good product, seems to work as advertised, and it is one of my 2 or 3 products in ""my deer spray rotation.""If you do want to try a homemade spray:The homemade spray is simply a gallon of water poured into a plastic milk jug, to which I add one raw egg, some hot sauce or powder, some garlic powder, a teaspoon or two of cinnamon, and a couple of squirts of liquid dish detergent.  I close the gallon container and put it out in the heat/sun to rot.  It smells bad, but so do most of these products. For a fraction of what commercial sprays cost, I have an effective homemade (inexpensive) spray.  Every time I use some of the jug I read water and another egg.  Every few uses I add some more of the other ingredients. The main ingredients are similar to a commercial product.  I add cinnamon as it cloaks some of the bad odor with a sweet smell as you walk past the plants, without making them taste/smell better to deer.  The dish detergent helps the spray adhere to plants but won't hurt the plant.  Keep in mind your dog may lick some of it up because of the egg.The main difference between homemade spray (aside from cost) is you have to respray it more frequently (after any heavy rain and most showers).  You can also save money on a sprayer by using a rinsed out Windex bottle.  These don't seem to clog as much as store-bought hand sprayers, and are basically free.The home spray does require some prep, and of course, more frequent applications, which can be time consuming, so you may want to simply opt for a ready-mixed product such as Ortho Deer B-Gon."
1462,266,5,"When cleaning the yard I've always used the method of raking things into a large pile, turning the rake over, and scooping leaves and debri between the rake and my hand. Things always fell between the rake tines and there were several smaller piles using this method.With the leaf scoops, you can attack any part of a leaf pile you want, and the remainder will be undisturbed. The best part, it gathers many of the smaller things often found in yards. With the rake I could not collect acorns. The scoops have no problem with them.So let's see, it takes less time and less effort, but costs more than if I stayed with my old way. Given how long I think these will last and how amazing they have performed already, I'd buy a second and third pair in a heartbeat!"
550,869,4,"The Havahart motion detector animal repellent does a fine job repelling ducks, rabbits, herons and other animals from backyards, gardens, and fish ponds.I tried the ""Havahart Spray Away Elite II Motion Detector Sprinkler Animal Repellent 5369"" model which keeps herons and ducks away from a backyard fish pond by spraying water and emitting an unexpected noise and motion to scare them away when approaching. A couple years ago herons entered our area in unwanted numbers to swoop down and grab unsuspecting goldfish out of the pond. They are less of a threat now but ducks are the nuisance of choice this year.The Havahart motion detector was easy to set up for use. One thing I really like about it is that the detector is solar operated so does not have to be plugged in or does not have batteries that eventually will have to be replaced.  The other nice feature is that it does not have to be hooked up to a hose. You just add water when you set up the detector and it works fine.Because it is hose-free and does not have to be plugged in to an electrical outlet, the detector is highly portable making it easy to move to different locations to find the best one. Once you find a good location the water basin (which holds 3  gallons of water) can easily be buried in the ground to make it more pleasing to the eye.The device can detect motion within 35 feet and protect an area up to 1,900 square feet. You can adjust the detector to cover a shorter distance so it does not spray water into an area where you frequently can be found walking around to avoid getting wet.In fact getting wet (once) is the only problem I have experienced so far. I am sure with improved memory on my part and some fine tuning adjustments this problem will lessen or go away. The Havahart Spray Away Animal Repellent is a motion detector that does its intended job and performs well over time."
1447,790,5,"We live in the mountains, and I love bird watching.  We have over 7 acres of land, and a few birdhouses and bird feeders, already.  When I saw this item, I was excited to try this out.  I set up this feeder on a Shepherd hook in the yard.  I like the ease of opening this particular feeder.  With feed it is stable and stays secure.  As it empties it tends to swing more in the wind.The construction is a copper finish on anodized aluminum.  I like that plastic comprises the windows but I wish it were fiberglass or tempered glass which would be more durable over time.  Filling can be messy and I found it best to fill it right next to the hook.Overall, I'm pleased with having another stylish feeder.  I'm even more pleased with the birds getting fed during the Spring.Two thumbs up!"

1584,774,5,"After reading all of the good reviews about this mower on Amazon, I purchased it to replace a push mower that didn't do a good job when it was new.  I was planning to use it as a mulching mower, but when I read how it acted like a vacuum clearer, I decided to try the catcher.  What a nice job it does, picking up the cut grass, even some of the bunny poop.  The lawn cut is even, and I don't even have to sweep along the patio, the mower picks up all the loose grass.  In spots the grass is thick, and I have to slow down a little, but the mower still cuts it evenly.  Sometimes the cord bugs me a little, but I know a battery mower would not have this much power.  The handle quickly folds up for compact storage.  Perfect for my small 1000 sq ft lawn.  I have used it 4 or 5 times now, and am very pleased with it."
1329,101,4,"Free of restrictive power cords, an electric weedwacker is a very convenient tool.  Black and Decker's NST2018 trimmer is very lightweight, and easy to use.  With a 12 inch diameter cutting path, the unit is suitable for light trimming, touch ups, edging, and catching small areas missed by a mower.  While the motor has enough power for moderate tasks, if you want to trim large areas, or tackle thick, high grass, you probably should look at something more powerful.The trimmer comes with two 18 volt batteries, and you will probably need them both to take on anything except a small job.  It is hard to predict how long a battery may last under actual use, but you might get fifteen minutes of run time from a new battery.  It is a just a good idea to make sure both batteries are charged up, before you start a job.The 0.065 inch trimmer line feeds automatically, you don't bang the spool on the ground, or manually feed line.  The auto feed system works pretty well, but does get stuck at times.  Since the electric motor does not generate higher speeds like a gas motor, the noise level is relatively low.  The unit is very light, and vibration is minimal.  The trimmer guard is constructed of durable hard plastic, and should not crack under normal use.This trimmer is a great for touch ups and smaller yards.  The freedom is wonderful, you are not polluting the air, and your hands won't get dirty mixing fuel."

262,714,3,"This works great for my garage, and on the OUTSIDE of my fence border. Behind my property is 160 acres of &#34;green belt&#34; as described by the HOA, but in reality is scrub, cedar and cactus. While I dig the natural setting, a natural setting means critters.I had left a bag of birdseed and a bag of grass seed in the garage over winter. Even after getting rid of it, there came an invading force of mice and rats who had pretty well entrenched themselves come spring.These things brought the signs of vermin invasion down to zero.BUT I would only use these in my garage or the outside of my fence (or other pet free zones) as they are NOT pet resistant. Cedar my cattle dog could have this open in a pair of minutes.If you have a garage and a spring invasion I think this is the ticket. If you are looking for something for your back porch or inside of your fence row AND have dogs, you are going to want to go another direction."
1383,266,5,"I was initially skeptical of these when looking at this product. However, after using this product, I am very happy with the purchase. I am using these primarily for picking up piles of leaves, compost, or other yard trash. I can either bag easier or simply move the material to provide mulch for my yard.I find these are well constructed and thought out. These are my reasons:(1) Yellow color.  Won't be easily lost in a pile of leaves or your yard.(2) Size is right. Perfect for scoop to deposit in yard bags.(3) Grips are perfect for me. At first, I thought they were a little loose for my size, but since I normally wear garden gloves during my work, the size is perfect and fits snugly for use with my gloves. Consider this a plus.(4) There is a small hole in the top of the scoops which makes hanging them up in my utility room easy.(5) Rake like scoops on the bottom help with raking up the pile for pickup.Some reviewers complain that they would like them to have a handle so they wouldn't have to stoop over. Personally, I would find a handle to be a nuisance and in the way. I use a rake first and then clean up with these. I think trying to tightly grip these together by using a short handle would not work very well."

980,19,3,"I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was ""waiting up"" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes."
1465,759,4,"I own rent properties. When properties are vacant, I take care of yard work myself. I have one 40V battery-based trimmer. I use the battery-based trimmer for properties with small yard. But two properties have a 1/4 acre yard with quite some think grass and some heavy vines also. My battery-based trimmer can barely handle the thick grass and it always struggles with the vines.I am glad to get the more powerful gas trimmer. This Remington RM2510 Wrangler is pretty lightweight...about the same weight of my 40V battery-based trimmer. The included manual gives very clear instructions about how to prime the engine and how to start it. I have no problem to start the engine. This is my 1st time to use gas-powered tool, and I am surprised how easy to start the engine. So far, based on my limited usages in one month, it usually starts within 3 pulls. The start-up instruction is also printed on the air filter hosing. So, no worry to keep the manual book around.Though it is more noisier than my battery-based trimmer, it's still in an acceptable range. This trimmer balances itself quite well. Even better yet, the curved shaft makes the trimmer head in parallel position against ground when I stand up-right. This really eases my back, especially when I use this trimmer for long period of time on the 1/4 acre yard.When it runs, the shaft does vibrate, which does not occur to my battery-based trimmer. After 40 minutes of usage, my arm does not feel sour. So, I think the vibrtion is not that bad.The trimming line is about twice as thick as my battery-based trimmer. I guess the line will last longer. When in high rpm, this trimmer sweeps through thick grass like chopping off cake with knife. And it rips though the vines easily.The package comes with a bottle of oil to be mixed with gas by user. However, the 40:1 pre-mixed gas can is widely available in Home Depot or Lowes already. The pre-mixed gas is in an easy-to-use metal can. Better yet, they add gas stabilizer additive to keep the gas last longer in the can. That's really convenient.So far, I am happy with this Remington RM2510 Wrangler trimmer."
479,771,5,"I've tried brands other than Miracle Grow to fertilize my plants, and I always return.  This time, I'm staying with Miracle Grow.  Some brands dissolve too quickly, and other brands seem to sit like pebbles on the soil, week after week.  This particular blend of granules works both indoors and outdoors (I find that outdoor use requires more frequent application), and it works for both flowers and vegetables.While this is a quality product, it is a general purpose one, which means that it will fertilize a broad range of plants without being tailored specifically to a particular kind, and it is not organic.  For experienced gardeners:  the formula is 12-4-8.  For less experienced one: These numbers give the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, nutrients for plant growth.  Tomato fertilizers are generally 18-18-21, so this adds some nutrients without giving them a full-strength kick.  I find that the general purpose is best for annuals, perennials, and non-acid-loving shrubs.  (I tend to rely on more organic methods with edible herbs and vegetables.) The only thing I'm not wild about is the ""shake 'n feed"" part, something that's great to broadcast the granules outside but which can make a mess when trying to spread them into pots.If you don't have the time or the memory to fertilizer your plants using organic or water-soluble fertilizers, go with the MiracleGrow.  It may cost more than other brands, but it always performs for me.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
1602,754,5,"The Nooski is a snap-trap that works by rolling a tiny rubber band onto a trigger that is released when the mouse takes the bait.  I can't tell you how humane it is, but I have dogs so poison is out, and although you do have to deal with the mouse afterwards, you can scoop it up in the trap itself, then toss it in the trash - the trap is reusable without having to mess with the part that snapped on the mouse (unless you'e INCREDIBLY cheap...)  The tiny rubberbands are a little tricky to roll into place, but the only real drawback is that you have to keep up a supply of them.I was kind of surprised this thing works so well.  I haven't had it long, but so far it's doing the job.  It IS all plastic - we'll see how long it lasts, but I never kept those spring-arm traps for more than a couple times...  So far I think the Nooski's the better mousetrap."

All this produced unbelievable weeds.  I have struggled with them and just gave up.  Then I ordered this handy helper and getting those large, nasty weeds is so easy!  I usually only work on weeds when the ground is damp because I don't want to hurt the tool that I have grown to love, and it does a super job.  This is tons easier than the old ways I have tried to control the weeds.  This is easy and permanent.  I love this tool."

1605,817,3,"We are always looking for ottomans.  Why is it that outdoor chairs and furniture sets don't come with them?  The fact that you can order this ottoman separately is a major plus.  Too bad though--after over a year of trying--the manufacturer still cannot attach the woven resin material evenly.  You know how it is when the stripes on a shirt/skirt/shorts are crooked?  Or when the lines don't match at the seam?  Well, my ottoman looks like it's tilted, but it isn't really.  It is the resin material that is applied on an angle and is heading off the bottom edge. Last year I ordered a cocktail table and an end table.  Both had the same problem:  The resin material was not lined up when attached to the frame.  It wouldn't be so bad if there was no color variation in the weave, but if you look closely at the picture you can see stripes--not severely contrasting stripes, but stripes all the same.  In my opinion, stripes need to line up:  On shirts or on furniture.NOTE:  I don't even need to post a picture of my own:  Just take a close look at the pictures posted on this product page.  Look at the front-on view and you can see the weave is angled.  It is more prominent when you stand a few feet away, and the tilt of the weave is even more prominent on my piece.  Highlight the close-up picture along the bottom edge and you can see where the weave runs off the edge.**UPDATE:  If you really want to buy this furniture, but are concerned about receiving a piece with the ""crooked look"", consider the darker color:  There is not so much difference in the weave color and you can't see stripes.**This ottoman is a nice height and is lightweight enough that anyone could move it around.  If you need a little extra storage space in the area when you use this furniture, the inside is hollow.The color of the resin weaving is identical to what was sold last season; so you can feel some confidence in a new piece matching one purchased last year.  The cushion is a neutral color and the material feels substantial.Regarding the cushion:  It is not attached at the base, so it slides around when you lift your feet up.  Also, there is no indication that the material is treated with Scotchguard.  We are going to spray the material with Scotchguard and apply some Velcro pieces.  It is a zippered cover, so I suppose it can be washed.The base is exactly like the tables, just a different size.  So, if you wanted to, you could remove the cushion and use it as a low table.  Like the tables, there is no support under the weave, but you can use it for very lightweight items (glasses, yes; not stemware).One last observation:  I got a table in this line last year that arrived with a broken leg and Amazon did not want it back.  We put it behind a storage shed in case Amazon changed its mind.  It has not gotten any use, but it has been out in the weather for a year now and the color and texture of the resin weave has not changed."

It is long enough to get the whole grill, but I also felt like I could control it (we have had some in the past that were just long and/or flimsy)."
983,936,5,"I love this handy 8 qt bag, that is not too heavy for this old lady to handle. I use it with my seed germination kit the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat MatHydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat. Seeds seem to start much quicker using both. Also use 1/4 cup in each new hole I plant a new plant from the store.Fun for the kids to build your own germination starter kit place soil and seeds in styrofoam egg cartons, moisten soil, wrap in plastic wrap and place on a home heating pad.  Easy to use potting soil that helps seeds to start to grow. I love that this potting soil has that little extra to make seeds start faster."

1041,504,5,We put this in the cabin where it's been catching mice. It's nice to have them in a nice clean tray instead of guts hanging out on a wooden trap for weeks before we get back up there. Tus far we've not had to change the batteries and we've caught about 10 mice. It's a great product. Love it!
549,880,1,"Updated: Bummed! At time of first review, I loved this hose, but it turns out it is a fail. After less than three months of use, the cloth completely detached from the coupling that attaches to the faucet. Not repairable. Useless.Previous Review Title: Makes My Daily Watering Easier And QuickerMother's Day is the beginning of the outdoor growing period in our area of the Rocky Mountains. Once winter's passed and there is little chance of snow, we begin transforming our barren, uninviting, expansive wood deck into a our own little summer oasis.From out of the basement, we move the barbeque, patio furniture, awnings, umbrellas, a gazebo, a fountain and a chimenea to make the deck an attractive outdoor living space. Dozens of planters and flower pots get arranged in groupings on the deck and in multiple hanging baskets.The job of planting and maintaining the annual flowers is happily all mine. Every morning I water and joyfully watch hundreds of blooms proliferate as summer heats up. Two heavy 25' traditional garden hoses are attached together to make one long hose. The length is necessary to zig zag my way back and forth across one thousand square feet of deck. The hose is heavy. Sometimes I have to stop and use both hands to swing it up, over and/or around the furniture, etc.About a month ago I received the Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose. I'm never going use my old traditional type again. The Rumford weighs about two thirds less. It takes me much less time maneuvering it about, plus it delivers better pressure than my old hose.My Rumford Hose has not ripped despite me dragging it up, down, across and around everything on our wooden deck. As I swirl it to collapse inside our hose pot it naturally drains and is protected from direct sunlight. From what I've read in other reviews, that might be the reason my Rumford Hose hasn't ripped. My hose pot isn't available here, but it is very similar to this Liberty Garden Products 1913 Hammered Bell Garden Hose Pot - Copper.The Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose has made my daily routine tons easier and given me more time to enjoy my hard work. I'd say I have more time to stop and smell the roses, but I don't grow them :)"
396,564,4,"This plant stand is very attractive and much prettier than the picture shown on Amazon but the manufacture seems to have some quality control issues.  Mine arrived with missing paint and several deep scratches in different places.  The stand was well packaged and the shipping box was undamaged so it either came from the manufacture like this or was damaged at some point before shipping.The stand is sturdy, sits level on the floor and will hold large as well as heavy plants without problems.  It appears to be well built and the cosmetic issues don't detract from the beauty of the stand but I have to wonder if the missing paint/scratches may cause the stand to rust in the future. Only time and exposure to the elements will tell."
780,153,5,"This product is very obvious in its high quality. I don't understand why a quality product like this doesn't come in a genuine leather pouch, because anyone would pay the extra money for a pouch that will last as long as the knife."
301,188,5,Trap rats near chicken feed and cat feed. Also was surprised that it caught several smaller mice. would have thought that they could have gotten out but they said put.
29,715,4,"Bait stations can be messy with spilling pellets which expose pets, kids and you to unnecessary pesticide exposure. This disposable bait station is a tidy way to offer up sweet smelling (to mice...) bait and prevent exposure to your loved ones. The container is hard plastic and small enough to be easily hidden. The rodents go in to eat the bait and wander off to die - no 'trap' per se.On the upside, if the mice eat the bait, they will die! On the downside, death by pesticide could happen anywhere. We've had rodents die under the house and in the walls after eating bait and the smell dies off only when the dead rodent dries up, which can take weeks!These bait stations are excellent for keeping the bait blocks hidden and neatly contained. In my garage I have traditional 'snap' traps that work well - albeit a pain to load, set, check and dump dead mice. However, this disposable bait station is duct taped under the hood of my car because after my last oil change the tech said there was evidence (poo) of rodent activity under my hood! An unexpected frustration, but this is perfect for leaving out a 'snack' for unwanted visitors in that space.I think these are a good alternative to messy traditional traps, and effective at attracting and killing mice. Just be aware they are not a 'trap' and only a bait station from which mice can come and go, dying either in or out of this bait station. They are also not eco-friendly (an issue for some) and filled with a toxic substance. I do not recommend them in areas where teething kids and or dogs who like to chew are present, as there would be the possibility of breaking through to the bait itself."
155,492,5,"Like others have said, this thing is a tank!!  It's heavy and very durable and I love the fact that you can switch or replace the brush/pad head so easily.  That's what wears out.If there's any con, it's that it's big and heavy and takes getting used to handling, compared to any other brush I've had or used but those others don't last 1 season before something breaks or the brush wears out or gets clogged beyond cleaning. But it has a soft grip halfway up the handle to hold is shorter if need be.  It's solid as can be and should last many years."
845,880,2,"I have tried two of these hoses at this point....first of all I would like to say that they do indeed work as advertised.  When no water is running to them they can be made very compact and stored almost in a cargo shorts pocket space...when you turn the water on you get a nice thin, lightweight 50ft hose.  All great...  Rumford even includes a carrying pouch so you can store the hose when not in use.I started using these as someone normally would...for light duty yard work, cleaning the deck, etc....nothing major.  The hose was always around a wooden deck or a soil filled flower bed...never near brick or concrete.  The first hose ripped after about 3 weeks and the Rumford after about 4 weeks.  Disappointing.It should be duly noted that I live in a home that has WELL water with very little pressure.  Yes it was enough to expand this hose...but not enough to make it rip apart.Personally I feel that this is a great product that may need a bit more work before I would recommend it.  I give it 2 stars because it does work and because Rumford is the only company that includes a carrying pouch.2/5...."
531,792,3,"I've been Birding my entire life. Growing up on a farm with fields, virgin prairie, wetlands, streams and forest, about the ONLY birds we never saw were those from the Tropics. I've taught birding classes at many a nature sanctuary and I have over 14 feeding stations on our acre of land with 5 bird baths, too. So, I'm no novice.When offered this water station, I was very excited, hoping that the smaller warblers and finches would find it attractive since they are such skittish birds. I hung this waterer from a pine limb that's dead and very stationary; it is right in the midst of the finch/warbler feeding stations.After a solid week of trial, Not.One.Single.Bird. has either approached it, attempted to approach it or even considered it!!! Now, birds are opportunists and will investigate ANYTHING that is new in their area. I've put out brand new feeders they've never used at 4:00 p.m. and by 4:10 p.m., the feeder is filled with birds. And it's not as if I didn't watch that area for interaction, as it's Spring Migration season Up North and I'm doing Bird Counts of migrants, being able to eyeball the waterer for hours on end.I'll keep it up, and if nothing else, the flying insects will get water from it. I'm sad. There was a lot of promise and hope with this product but zero delivery. I ranked it 3 stars because it is very well made and came with clear instructions. But, just like when you buy a toy for your cat or dog and they NEVER play with it, it doesn't mean the toy is Bad, it just means that it holds no attraction to your individual pet. So it is with this device: I can't rate it as bad in construction and I can't rate it as ""bad"" for providing water, just MY birds had no desire to even attempt to use it. Sorry. :("
966,167,4,"We have no deer problem, but squirrels drive our dog nuts and steal bird food from our feeders. I put this around the area and voila, no squirrels. Then it rained and they were back. So, spray after each rain.As for the battery-powered sprayer, what's the point, other than using more liquid than needed and thus perhaps making you buy more? Oh, cynical thought. What company would promote something that made you use more of their product than needed? A simple manual sprayer is fine here, unless you plan on spraying a huge area. Plus you really don't need much of this for it to work. A few ounces in a thin stream covered the perimeter of a couple hundred square feet for us.So yes, the stuff works, and no, you don't need the power sprayer version. Just buy it in bulk and put it in your own dollar store spray bottle with the nozzle set to long thin stream."
571,444,5,"This is by far the best hoze nozzle I've ever owned.  The water flow is incredible.  It is easy to adjust the flow, and the shut-off valce is positive and easy to use.  My wife loves this for shooing birds out of our trees after they attack our cat in the yard.  The spray can be adjusted fine enough to use as a cooling spray, not a small thing in Phoenix.  We bought two after trying one.** Updated ReviewAfter a few months of using this Nozzle, we are even more impressed.  There are no signs of wear after a harsh Arizona summer, and the nozzles (we have two) function as smoothly as the day we got them."
606,858,5,I was honestly a little unsure if this kit was something I could do on my own. Once it arrived I read the directions and set out to do the tune-up myself. Come to find out it was so easy I even ordered a kit to do my grandmother's mower as well.
792,295,5,These are ok!I thought they would be a little bigger but the descriptions did not specify and I probably should have asked how big these were gonna be!  If you are trying to grown things that should not be transplanted like I was you have to transplant very quickly if they get too big too quick!  Also you will want to punch a whole at the bottom and that helps the peat pots brake down quicker in your soil and helps the roots get through a little more quicker!  The hole does not have to be so big just enough to get the roots out so if you can fit your finger in it then it is big enough!
637,65,5,This product enables those who have difficulty bending down to be able to work in the garden effectively and with ease.  It is easy to set up and collapse for storage.  It was priced fairly.
1160,156,4,Nicely constructed skewers. They don't roll. They are not too wide and hold the food well. So what else could you want?
86,853,5,This is so neat.  It's made of wood and comes all together and all you have to do is unfold it.  Each section has it's own plastic liner which is wonderful so that you don't have to go looking from store to store to find something to fit in it.  I have all my miniture orchids in this and it's just so darn cute.  It holds three mini orchids on the top then 1 in each of sections that expand out.  It's really sturdy and I am going to be getting a couple more of these just for the fact that they are cute and don't take up a ton of space.  Such a cleaver idea.  Think I will paint my different colors though as I really do like bright colors.  Great gift if you know a plant lover.
1665,874,4,"This kit is easy...super easy. Good for children and beginners, but it sure is spendy. You can buy a boat load of seeds and top soil with the same results. But a burning question is why California won't allow it?"
1264,833,5,"I was absolutely floored to realize Snake-B-Gone's active ingredients are NATURAL ESSENTIAL OILS!  Not only is it effective for snakes,  it's effective to deter a range of critters - think snake FOOD. No food, no snakes. I also used sulphur powder,  between these two I haven't seen any snakes at all - which is rare indeed.  I am thrilled!"
264,4,4,"There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it."
1433,938,5,"This feeder is definitely a cut above the plastic hummingbird feeders I've used before. It's attractive. I love the copper and glass combination. It's also easy to fill. The opening is wide so I don't have to use a funnel.This feeder has perches for the birds, if they're so inclined, to sip the nectar. I have never seen any of my humming birds sit while feeding, but I'm interested to see what they do with this feeder. The humming birds aren't back in Northeast Pennsylvania yet. I can't wait to see if they like it as much as I do!"
1563,268,5,"I bought this grill cover to replace one that had been destroyed by the sun over four years or so.  This cover is made with a heavy vinyl material, has side vents to prevent condensation, and has a drawstring bottom.  The Large fits my Kenmore 4-burner with side burner perfectly and is easy to get on and off.  I am pleased with this purchase and recommend it."
896,640,5,We have two of these hanging outside our kitchen window so we can watch the birds feed while we eat.  I have seen many species go in and out of the feeder with no problems.  It did take about a week for the birds to adjust to this style feeder but once they did they use it all the time.  I have watched many squirrels try - really hard but after time they gave up - hardly ever see them try these days.  We are happy with them.
80,9,5,"My string trimmer is a great light duty tool and works very good. I bought the extra spools of string for two good reasons it is much cheaper through Amazon than our local retailers and with fuel for the auto's being at $3.35/ gal. this saves 3 trips to get the string and luck being what it is chances are when you give out of string the retailer will be out also. Good Buy from a good outfit to do business with(Amazon.com).Thanks again,Denny"
1574,276,5,"UPDATED... UPDATEDI am totally re-doing this review.  And it's all because this is now my FAVORITE feeder.  Why?  The birds just love it.Goldfinches! and other small birds --those red house sparrows, other finches, nuthatches, chickadees, and titmice-- all love it.Those lovely goldfinches tend to stay at the bottom tray, but everybody else will also hang from the sides.---------------OLDER NOTES:I really like the looks of this bird feeder, but for my location it isn't quite as useful as my old greenHeritage Farms Feeder.What I like about it is that it holds a lot of seed.  It's also very pretty.  The bronze looks nice, and best of all, the small birds like it(**see notes at the bottom) --although it initially took them some time to get used to it; and they tend to like eating from the tray, more than hanging from the wire frame.PROS--very attractive, and without the seed, is compact--holds a lot of seed--birds like itCONS--if you're like me and have nightly raccoon raids and like to bring in your feeder, you're going to have a mess on your hands.  Without a structure it collapses a bit and seed gets pressed out and ... it falls on the floorWhen the feeder comes it is very compact.  I think this is a nice feature for anyone who moves frequently.To load the feeder I undid the top and let the feeder naturally expand. Then I used a pitcher to scoop up sunflower seed and pour it in the opening.  The seed cascades down through the central holes on each level as the one above fills.  If your pitcher doesn't have a spout that helps with pouring, you might want to use a stiff paper to form a funnel.  But it's probably going to be messy however you do it, so I suggest you do what I did and take the whole operation outside.This is a pretty feeder that will hold a big bag of seed.  Birds like it, and while the squirrels were very curious about it at first, they don't seem to be attacking it now.Highly Recommend.  (Like most bird feeders, you'll have to try it with your local squirrel population)"
1041,622,5,"This product worked great the very first night. I had dead snails laying all over the place. What I like best about this product, compared to others, is that there was no dust flying around. I don't like breathing in poison. This made me a happy camper."
458,727,5,"this holds lights quite well, it can slip if it gets too much weight, tie a slip knot to secure"
681,1,5,"I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.  A bit on the heavy side, but that is what makes them last so well."
1197,828,5,"After fighting with the deer and the rabbits for several years and trying to keep them away from our flowers and shrubberies, we tried a cheaper ""scarecrow"" type of sprinkler.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  It helped some but was very inconsistent.  We decided to step up our defense with the Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion Activated Sprinkler.  I am happy to report, so far so good!!!  All flowers and shrubberies (in range) are in tact.  I also love that multiple sprinklers can be connected.  We haven't used it as a pure ""sprinkler"" setup and am not sure if we ever will.  It just works too well as a critter deterent to mess with the success.  We currently have it in a location so that it isn't set off unknowingly by ayone such as mailman, ups delivery, etc., so we haven't used the timer function either.  It's nice to know it's available if we decide to move it or purchase additional units in the future to cover other more ""traveled"" parts of the yard in the future.  OH -- one more bonus is that my neighbor's cat no longer uses the flower bed as his litter box!!! Yahoo!!!!  He hasn't moved to an area in the yard yet that isn't covered by this sprinkler, so we're set until he figures that out.  Once he does, we will probably purchase another unit.  The one time I saw his reaction when he got drenched was totally priceless!!!  I just wish I had also set up a motion activated video camera for that!!!"
1602,943,5,"This is a clever idea - if you have a certain type of little &#34;yard&#34; you are familiar with trying to mow it with a string trimmer.  Sometimes you overswing into the adjoining plants, sometimes you kick up a divot...  But what if you could just slot the trimmer into a wheeled frame that would keep it level, maybe height-adjustable?  Voila!Of course you're not covering as much grass as a blade-mower: you're limited to the length of the string.  That's a max cutting radius of 6&#34; here, though I guess beyond that the string would be kicking around anyway.  And in this case it's lithium-battery powered, which is what it is - currently about 15 minutes a charge (new battery...)  However it's LOTS lighter than any reel mower I've ever carried, easier to use, more effective, and far more convenient to store.For my old &#34;yard,&#34; a cascade of little terraces on an urban slope, this would've been PERFECT.  For my current yard, which is convenient to external outlets, corded would be better, and cheaper in the long run.  But on the whole, this has been very useful so far.  It all depends on how long the MTC220, its batteries (and the string) lasts."
964,842,1,"This brand name of this product is Garden Safe, and labeled as a rooting hormone to promote growth of plant clippings, so I grabbed it feeling confident that it is a safe product. However, after reading the inner label and the multitude of warnings, I am not confident about using the product at all. Gardening / &#8220;Garden Safe&#8221;/ must wear protective eye gear &#8211; these do not all belong in the same sentence.  I then did some internet research and the EPA labels the active ingredient in this product as a pesticide as well as growth hormone, and states when used in low doses the resulting toxicity risk is correspondingly low&#8230;.No thanks, I will stick to the old fashioned method of clipping, putting the clipping in water or soil as indicated for that plant species, and add a little organic fertilizer for nutrition. I know even organic fertilizers come with a warning against inhaling, and organic soils come with a warning label to wear gloves when handling, but I feel this rooting hormone product is a bit too toxic to justify the need to use it over traditional methods. And I certainly would not use it on food plantings!"
602,769,4,"Doesn't smell great.This works, but as with all things miracle grow, my lungs are not in love with it."
899,869,4,"The Havahart spray Away Elite II is a stand-alone (i.e., no hose required) device that deters garden pests by spraying them with water.  It contains a reservoir that has to be filled periodically, a motion detector, and a PV solar panel that keeps it charged.  It's easy to assemble and set up; although Havahart claims it comes fully charged, I would count on leaving it in the sun for a few days before using it.I had the previous model of this device and wasn't very happy with it.  My biggest complaint was that it wasn't sensitive enough to detect and deter smaller animals.  Apparently I wasn't the only one, because Havahart quickly took it off the market and replaced it with the Elite II.  I'm not sure what other tweaks they made, but the Elite II is more sensitive, and I've been happier with it. (The sensitivity is adjustable.) The previous model worked reasonably well with deer, while the Elite II also is triggered by squirrels and some birds. Every time?  No, but pretty often.The downsides of being more sensitive are that the unit needs to be recharged and refilled with water more frequently.  It holds about 3-1/2 gallons, which keeps it operating in my yard for about four or five days; obviously your mileage may vary.  Because it must be charged by the sun, you have to find a sunny spot for it, especially if it's going to be triggered more than once in a while.  If it's consistently shady it likely will run down; I had that problem only once, however.Let's face it, you can't expect a droid to perform perfectly, but this device is much better than nothing, and offers the ability place it far from any hose, and needs no batteries."
659,810,4,This spray version hooks up easy to the garden hose and it sprays out fine.  I think it is hard to figure out how much of the spray is coming out at a time so I think I would probably prefer the granules. We tested out the spray and the granules on different areas of the lawn and so far they both seem to work well.  No more mounds of dirt on our lawn.  And no more dangerous holes where my little nieces feet can fall into.
1360,798,5,"This hummingbird feeder is beautiful and elegant. It's a fairly heavy glass bottle which screws onto the resevoir base. Because of this design, it's a little awkward to fill and flip: the neck of the bottle is fairly narrow. The metal base is an antiqued looking color, with metal flowers from which the birds sip. There's a metal bail on the top from which it is supported if you hang it from a tree or hanger.The pale green of the bottle is reminiscent of the irridescent colors of a hummingbird, and is complemented by the color of the base. This is a very pretty feeder which would look good in any yard. The only drawback I can see is the narrow necked bottle, which will make cleaning it more difficult that if it were a wider necked bottle."

1461,841,3,"After reading the information on the back of the Spectracide can, I was convinced that it would not only kill all the weeds I was having problems with, but also all of my plants and me. There are seriously scary warnings, and I was actually hesitant to use it. But use it I did, and I can say it works. The results are not spectacular, and I was actually hoping for fast elimination of weeds growing between our pavers, but within two weeks, green and healthy turned brown and dry and I hadn't grown two more heads.I've never used a herbicide before which may be why I found the warnings so threatening. Spectracide has not made a convert of me and I will definitely continue hand-weeding, which may be tedious at times but gets instant results and never makes me think I might mutate."
927,216,5,"I realize that the intended purpose of Azomite is as a plant fertilizer but that some people use it as a nutritional supplement. I did myself for a while while also using it to grow wheatgrass. I have encountered a problem by storing it in a shut closed cabinet that also contained fabric softener sheets (e.g,, Bounce sheets). The scent of the sheets over time somehow made it's way through two fairly thick paper bags and also a thin vegetable plastic bag (knotted closed to lock out air), and this gave it the taste of the fabric sheets. I tried to deal with it, but I eventually threw away two 3 pound bags after realizing what had happened.I'm letting everyone know of this (in online reviews, blogs, etc) so that they can possibly share it with others who might use it for the same purpose! You might pass it along to anyone else you know who uses it in the same way...to be careful where they store it. Storing it next to anything that have a strong smell could mean that the Azomite will absorb that even through a thin plastic. (The thicker plastic bag it comes in here may be enough to keep the scent from being absorbed...I'm not sure.)Also, if it can absorb the scent of fabric sheets, I'd guess it can absorb other things in the air, so be careful not to leave it near other volatile fumes (e.g., ammonia, gas for your lawnmower). You definitely don't want your Azomite absorbing harsh chemicals, since eventually it will be coming in direct contact with something you might eat."

79,878,1,"I have had this set out for about two weeks.  It hasn't caught one rat or mouse!  However, the first night I had it out, something did try to eat the bait (dog food).  When I got up the next morning, I discovered the Rat Zapper turned upside down, with the battery cover dislodged and the batteries (and bait) strewn a couple feet from the trap.  Apparently, it has enough of a zap to royally tick off whatever critter wanted the bait, but not enough to kill it.I put the batteries back in and re-baited (and reset) the trap.  Two days later, the kill light was flashing, and I eagerly looked inside.  The trap was empty.  Not only was there no critter in the trap, but the bait was gone.I gave it one more try.  Put more dog food (and peanut butter smeared in a soda pop top -- you can't put wet bait directly on the bait tray), and then I reset the trap.  It has been almost two weeks, and except for the bait, it sits empty.  I guess the critters learned their lesson, and they've decided to leave the trap alone, but still infest my property.I can't recommend a trap that merely annoys its intended victim, but doesn't kill it."
1389,167,5,"This product is very easy to use and it works in a most excellent way! I used this around our bird feeder where squirrels were eating all our bird food. After spraying the Deer Off on the bird feeder pole and around the base, the squirrels stopped coming near it, and it did not bother the birds at all.Deer Off comes in a container all ready to use - no mixing or putting anything together. The spray attachment is a very lightweight squeeze-type gun with an adjustable twist nozzle to change the spray from narrow to broad. The power that runs this spray is battery, and the battery is included. So everything is ready for you to use right out of the box.The instructions are simple, always shake before use, and try it on a small patch of plants before wide use to be sure it won't hurt the plants. Keep it away from children, and be careful of using on a windy day because you don't want to get this on your or on your face. The main ingredients are rotten eggs solids (sulfur smell), capsaicin (hot pepper oil),and garlic. The product says it is a taste and smell deterrent - and with those ingredients, you can believe that.The product covers 1,000 square feet, it is weather resistant, and promises to protect flowers and shrubs, and you only need to reapply every 2-3 months. It is not suggested for use on food items, but you can spray it on the outside perimeter around the garden to keep animals out of your garden. If you do get exposed, all you need to do is wash hands, face, eyes etc. with water."
705,761,5,"Sweeney's Deadset Mole Trap is the best way to deal with moles invading your lawn.  The device is sturdy, and easy to set. Most importantly, this trap is effective.I have tried pellets and flooding the moles out with little to no success.  When that didn't work I tried killing them with a shovel.  That was gruesome.Sweeney's Deadset Mole Trap gets the job done and saved my lawn.  Really I think this is the best way to get rid of moles when you are doing it yourself."
45,465,5,"This rooting hormone has never disappointed me personally. I use it to propagate cuttings of ficus, dragon fruit, life saver plant, hibiscus, desert rose, Asian jasmine, etc. Most of it goes to propagate Asian jasmine, though, as I am currently planting a large area with this ground cover. As far as the jasmine goes, I calculated that my cutting loss turned out to be about 20% for approximately 1800 cuttings&#8212;not a bad number at all, in my opinion. I must mention that since Asian jasmine is a ground cover vine, its vines are thin and I suspect that most of the 20% loss is due to me cutting too thin or young vines. In any case, I am still very pleased with this product. With the other cuttings I deal with, I lose maybe 1% of the propagated cuttings, and this percentage is almost exclusively hibiscus cuttings.I will always use this hormone for any of my propagation needs!"
840,923,3,"As others have noted, the wobbly dome on this feeder scares birds away. Not the squirrels, of course. Squirrels would sit through an earthquake and eat the bird seed if they could. I actually do like squirrels, but if you have ideas that this feeder will keep squirrels away, you will be disappointed. I also keep the grate off, because little birds have trouble getting any seed unless the feeder is completely full. So it is sort of a mini platform feeder. The feeder is also good for mealworms, which are great to put in your feeder during nesting season when the birds need lots of energy."
214,553,3,"I have a minifruit orchard in my backyard.  All my small trees and shrubs seem to be okay except for one of the persimmon trees, which has riddled leaves.  So my initial impression is that it works okay, but I haven't tried it out for a whole season yet.  Might be cheaper to just get regular nonfancy sulfa based spray."
396,699,5,"The one and only time I've had a rodent inside my home it was almost impossible to get rid of.  I placed sticky traps and wooden traps to no avail.  The critter would trip the wooden traps every night but managed to stay out of harms reach.  I could see evidence of he/she being caught by the sticky trap but once again managed to get off.  I was beginning to feel like I had a mouse with a PhD in escaping from traps.A friend recommended that I try Motomco Bait Station.  I placed these underneath my kitchen sink, in my laundry room and in bathrooms.  After a few days I could tell something was eating the bait.  I have not seen any evidence of mice in my home since beginning using these.Now, I don't wait until I see the evidence of rodents inside my house before placing traps and poisons.  I place bait stations underneath my house, in and under my storage shed and inside my tool shed and check regularly and replace if needed.The company claims these are pet safe and child resistant.  My children are grown and I don't have pets.  I did attempt to pry the top off and was unable to do so.  These are ready to place right out of the package.  When the bait is gone simply toss and replace.Motomco Bait Stations work.  I highly recommend them for getting rid of mice.  As the old saying goes, ""An Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure""-Benjamin Franklin"

15,622,4,"We used this product in our garden. After one application, we noticed significant reduction in slugs and snails, but some were still there. We are confident that a second application will eliminate them all.It is not a product you can just use right away - there are instructions to follow such as time of day, soil conditions, etc. So, it is somewhat inconvenient.We definitely recommend this product due to the low price and the effectiveness."

441,747,4,"I have several other B&D; products that use the same battery. Many complain about the short working times between charges, which is true. But since the tools work about as expected, the battery issues is not a big deal to me.The blower itself works fine."
1503,791,5,I bought this for the vacuum feature. I have a blower but the leaves just blow back over the yard. This sure beats raking! The bag connector is plastic and my first one arrived broken. I requested just a new bag and a whole new machine arrived in the mail in just a few days. But the machine itself really works great. My second one has not been used yet.
1255,258,4,I'm changing my review as when I got the chain saw it wouldn't cut anything.  One of the viewers replied saying they thought the chain was on wrong.  It looked ok but I did as recommended and it worked.  Wasn't happy about a brand new saw right out of the box was set up wrong.  It's been cutting since the change
109,265,3,"I have owned nice hoses before and this is not one of them.  It kinks very easily, just like cheap hoses.  Its fittings are nice and it appears to be made to last, but for the money I have purchased much better hoses that do not kink.Update: I have owned this for a over a year now and have bumped it up to 3 stars from 2. Yes it does kink doing sharp turn maneuvers such as when washing a car back and forth it kinks sometimes when I am walking and turn 90 or 180 degrees and drag the hose. The reason for upping the star count is I have again experienced how bad a cheap hose kinks, and this one is not that bad. (I owned a really nice hose at my previous house that was left there, I purchased it at ACE Hardware, but can't remember the brand and haven't been back in to look for it. This hose is good enough to get the job done that I need) Given this hose is only $20, I give it 3 stars now."
759,180,5,This is the best feeder Ive ever used. I have so many different birds and they love the fact they can get seed and suet in one setting. The cedar is an added bonus! :-)
1651,49,4,"The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width, length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive, just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway."

1569,742,5,"My wife and I were looking all over for an outdoor living set and we finally settled on this one. I tell ya, I'm not wasting my time or money in retail stores anymore. Amazon delivered another great product at a reasonable price. This coffee table is stylish, contemporary, and durable. It compliments the matching sofa perfectly. Originally i thought it might be a little big, but it compliments the sofa perfectly, smaller would look out of place. I'm glad I got this and I am sure I will have some great memories in the back yard this summer sitting around this coffee table"
241,868,4,"I  bought these containers for strawberries and upsidown tomatoes, and I think they'll be perfect for both.  The container is quite spacious and sturdy, simpler than my other hanging containers, but nice.The best thing to compare the inside material to is the thing that it's meant to imitate, the coconut matting that's gotten popular recently.  That's what my other two hanging containers use.  This material is thinner and, to be honest, not as attractive.  As I have only recently hung and planted these, I don't know how it's going to hold up over the summer growing season, but I'll try to remember to report back, this winter."
1191,101,5,"I love this trimmer for every week sprucing up; it is not powerful enough for heavy duty trimming but does a great job on things I maintain regularly; with two batteries, there is plenty of trimming time for a large yard"
97,924,4,"This can work well to avoid squirrels snacking if you hang it on a slicker surface or right against the house where they don't like to come.  In fact that works great for the birds--they enjoy it on the porch and everybody gets to watch the fun.So it's perfect for this household and where I wanted to put it.But I wanted to forewarn anyone looking for something to put on a tree or with easy access to squirrels, they are gonna love ya for it if you choose this one.They can just nudge that lid up and curl up inside for an all day food orgy.But--if you use it as I do, you'll love it.  I did remove a star for that coupled with it's not as sturdy as some other Perky Pet bird feeders I have.  They make great feeders and I love the fact that this one can go against something flat due to the back, which is unusual, so it does have its place."
1394,958,4,"We have an older model Kenmore propane grill, handed down from my mom. Over the years we&#8217;ve replaced the grill cover three times, always buying the same type heavy cover that quickly faded and showed UV damage.The Budge Industries cover is a bit larger, and considerably lighter than the previous covers. I was apprehensive about the durability of one so lightweight, but since the others have only marginally held up, I was anxious to give this one a try. I like that there&#8217;s a non-toxic barrier to corrosion and UV protection. The light weight makes it easy to put on and remove, and there are Velcro straps to keep it snugged down in windy weather.Time will tell how durable it will be, but I&#8217;m happy with it and the neutral color looks ever so much better on our deck and against the newly painted house."
540,532,3,"I finally got a chance to use this, and well, this is one of those products that you don't really need.  For the amount of smoke flavor that it puts out, soaked wood chips wrapped in a piece of aluminum foil will work just as well.  It's a cute little box that holds a small amount of wood chips and delivers an equally small amount of smoke.  If you just like to have gadgets and cool looking tools then this will fit the bill. Otherwise, save your money and invest in a roll of heavy duty aluminum foil to fashion your own smoker box and call it a day.By the way, the lid is sort of hard to get off, and I broke a nail in the process."
1168,229,5,"I'm in the Suburbs of Chicago, and our area has a lot of Possums and Raccoons - some of those Raccoons look like giant mutant Ferrets. I'm remodeling the house, and am away a week at a time. I've occasionally found animal droppings around the foundation and under the deck. In the past I've tried the commercial bottles of animal urine (really stinks, easy to spill, requires a lot!) So I liked the idea of 1) pellets, 2) ease of application, 3) Does not stink.After spreading these around the perimeter with the handy-dandy container design, and adding some to the fence where I thought the critters were entering (climbing over and digging under) I left for a week. No new signs of these foul critters. In other words, the little used side of my house (you know, where the A/C sits along with little used hoses and the like) was poop free.The stuff looks slightly oily (I assume from the black pepper oil) and smells like a day-old Cajun dinner. Lots of spice, a little stale. The active ingredients are Capsaicin (as in pepper spray and really hot spices), black pepper oil and piperine (piperine is responsible for pungency of black pepper.)So when animals, with their super-sensitive noses, smell this stuff, it chases them away. Like pepper-spray does, only this is passive.There's also a decent amount, so I can apply several times (after heavy rain, a few weeks, etc.)"
669,638,4,"UPDATE 12/29 ordered a 2nd block just to have some (lotta) extra. excellent stuff. NB no nutritive value really, so get some fertilizer appropriate to whatever you're planting.ORIGINAL review 12/24:this is amazing stuff - clean, sterile, perfect consistency. you may want to look for boxes of smaller pellets if you only plan on getting a little at a time - this block, you either make the whole thing at once (thassa lotta dirt) or else take a knife or saw to it and mix up the amount you need.I will say again: I love how clean this stuff is. no parasites, no bugs, no extra crap of any kind. no gnats flying out, no tiny little worms that you aren't sure are good or bad!in the past I was always skeptical of how could fibre from coconuts really be a soil alternative - but once you reconstitute it you absolutely cannot tell the difference. I will never buy potting soil or peat/sphagnum moss again."
1418,54,5,"I put up 2 of these. One was about 20' from an apple tree which the yj's just love. Had no problem until the end of the season, I'm guessing that that's when the 10 weeks supply ran out. I put a 2nd near my veg garden and about 15' form old tree roots which the yj's also find irresistible. No problem there either this year.Would buy again."
1318,876,5,"I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review, good or bad.  I was not compensated for this review in any way.Based on earlier customer reviews, I was a bit doubtful about the quality of this grill brush prior to receiving it. But, by the manufacturer's comments on those poor reviews stating that the brush had been greatly improved upon and even offering the customers free replacements with the improved version, I was hopeful.As soon as I received this brush in my hands, I was very impressed. It has a strong wooden handle and extremely heave gauge wire that does not bend at all when I push on it. It has an extra wide head on it for good surface coverage and nice long wire bristles for reaching down along the sides of the grates. To top it off, it looks so darn sexy alongside my other grilling accessories!As with any grill brush, you should clean your grates while they are still hot for easiest cleaning, before the cooked on food has a chance to harden and dry. With the extra long handle, cleaning my grates while hot was not to be feared because my hands stayed far away from the hot grates. The wide head allowed me to cover more area at once making the job faster, especially having the nice long bristles reaching so well in between the slots.I have only used this grill brush once so I can not swear to how long it will hold up over time. However, it comes with a 1 year guarantee and I simply can not imagine it not holding up well. You would have to hold this puppy in your hands to know what I mean. I kind of feel like a Viking warrior holding it..makes me want to start swinging it around over my head and give a blood-curdling yell."
954,559,2,"I had these things all over my house, inside and out.  Did NOTHING to control the sugar ants in Florida.  Maybe a different type of ant is attracted to these but for those tiny little ants in Florida, Terro liquid baits work the best.  The ants pay zero attention to these Combat baits."
145,749,4,"I've been using this for approximately 5 weeks now.  As a baseline, I am coming from using a pair of Homelite 2-Stroke trimmers for 20 years. These Gas trimmers were straight shaft, dual .80 lines. They started reasonably well despite some occasional flooding.  But it was always somewhat of a ""Special Effort"" to use them, an effort that made me tend to skip a week.This 36V BD is just ""push the botton and go"". It is so easy to use, that I may pick it up anytime during the week...even when I am not specifically mowing the grass.  It does not Rip, Snort, and Tear like the Gas Trimmer. I think mostly because of the single .65 line.  It is a ""Kinder, Gentler"" trimmer, but it gets the job done.  It takes just a little longer than using the gas trimmer.  A benefit of this Gentler cut is that it does not splatter my shins and shoes with as much debris.  I now feel OK trimming with shorts on.  With the Gas, I always wore Jeans to keep my shins from getting all nicked up. This Gentler cut also is more forgiving for mistakes.This does take a couple of rounds of practice to get used to it, depending on what you were replacing it with.  Took me a couple times to ""Edge"" straight, but the end results look great.  I think the lower head end is a bit on the heavy side.  The battery at the top helps balance it.So, it performs well.  How about the battery life?  I have 10,000 sq. ft of yard.  But I have to do fences, landscape trimming, sidewalk/driveway edging, etc.  If I ""Just Trim"", I can get done easily on one charge.  If I try to Trim and do extensive sidewalk and driveway edging at the same time, I tend to need to move into the second battery from my B&D; Blower.  But that's OK by me for the convenience.The charger is fast.  I have two, but only opened the one.  BTW, the Blower is much weaker than the Trimmer.  Convenient, sure, but not very powerful...(read my review)The Trimmer is a great tool (and toy!)"
140,368,5,"I love how there is a handle ontop of the cover allowing me to easily remove the cover for immediate use. There is a gap below the cover thus it will not reach the ground, but I do not find this a problem."
589,654,5,"I haven't used this yet, but looking foward to it.  This dome is of quality so I'll be able to use it year after year.  It wasn't stated that it comes with a bottom seedling tray, but it does.  I am so looking foward to starting my garden this year."
738,556,5,"As subversive as it may sound, I've never looked forward to holiday feast featuring turkey.  The birds never cook evenly with parts overly dry and other parts greasy.  And this happens despite basting, changing temperature, brining, tenting with foil.  Friends boasted about the great results they got with their outdoor turkey friers but here in New York, it gets cold outside.  I was also dissuaded by the hellish tales of houses burning down and propane gas explosions.  So after infomercial indoctrination and a gold box special, I purchased this indoor fryer.Easy to set up, it uses only two to three gallons of oil. We cooked a ten pound turkey(must be completely thawed) in forty minutes.  It was a gorgeous --golden brown and could have graced the cover of a magazine.  But most amazing of all was the juciness.  The skin was crisp but the meat cooked to mouth watering perfection.  Since then I have fried chicken, turkey and even prime rib roast, with the same succulent result.Draining the oil is easy.  There is a valve and an attachable spout that makes emptying a snap. The unit is compact and can be stored on a countertop.I recomend this fryer.  It is versatile and can be used for a wide variety of foods and steaming.  Most importantly, the reslts are uniformly excellent."
753,851,5,Love this hummingbird feeder.  It has large capacity and looks nice outside my bedroom window next to the windchimes.  The hummingbirds were right on this feeder the first morning I put it out.  A classic and worth the money.
124,836,3,"We have always had a dog and cat problem on our property, especially around the utility pole on our tree lawn. Every dog sniffs that utility pole and uses our lawn as a public toilet. Over the years, we have tried many things to keep the neighborhood dogs and cats off of our property, but nothing really works, including this Ortho Dog & Cat B Gon.I shook this spray bottle really well and sprayed around the utility pole, as the directions said. The dogs simply ignored the smells this spray bottle leaves on the ground. Then, I went back to my old reliable pepper. Regular black pepper keeps some dogs away, but after a good rain washes the pepper away, they go right back to doing their business on our tree lawn. Keeping pepper on the lawn around the utility pole is a constant chore since it doesn't last but a couple days, but at least over half the dogs don't like sniffing it, which means saving our lawn from dying a little longer.When I saw this Dog & Cat B Gon doesn't work, I went and sprinkled my black pepper on the lawn. For the next few weeks, I saw every neighborhood dog sniff, then keep walking to find a better smelling yard to do their business in. I have never seen every dog sniff and move on without relieving themselves on our lawn. Usually the pepper keeps away half the dogs. Using this Ortho Dog & Cat B Gon with black pepper works great for keeping the dogs from doing their business on our lawn. The best part is, I don't have to put the black pepper down every other day. It lasts a full week to a week and a half- even if it rains! Now, I can concentrate on growing my grass back on our tree lawn.This Ortho Dog & Cat B Gon contains Geraniol (from Geranium oils), Castor Oil and Peppermint Oil. Sprinkling black pepper which is cheap after spraying this on the parts of your lawn you want to keep the dogs and cats off of, is great because it lasts a good week. Since I see 100% of dogs stay away from it, but only some cats, I have to give this 3 Stars- due to the fact that it only works with the addition of black pepper sprinkled over it. I think of this as an addition to my black pepper which allows me to keep the dogs away for a good full week."
893,129,4,"This feeder is HEAVY. That translates to sturdy. No more little squrriel teeth mangling up the finish and function. Three small feeding slots are located on the front of the feeder. the perch, where the birds sit themselves to dinner, is spring operated. It stays open until something heavier than a bird grabs it. This would be the squrriels. the perch pivots downward, closing the feeding slots. The spring is adjustable, so depending on the size of the squrriels in your neighborhood, it can  be adjusted to thwart the little furball from raiding the seed bin. However, they may be able to hang from the roof of the feeder and reach some tasty morsels, but not a lot of seeds are accessible from the top through the slots. We use a variety of seeds, including sunflower seeds, and haven't found one that won't go through the slot from the supply bin.this is all metal, except for the windows, which are mounted into the feeder walls and serve as supply indicators. the top opens with the twist of the windvane. This is where you fill the feeder. It is a twisting affair to close and open the feeder, I don't see how squrriels have the strength to open it, so that will end the pop-the-top burglars. It has a heavy handle to hang it with, or there's the pole/base mount that comes with it if you want to place it on the top of a pole. It's built to last."
1497,102,5,I bought 2 of these heat mats for my seedlings and they just took off. It does not get overly hot and I used them with the plastic black trays at most garden centers. I could tell the difference between seedlings on the mat and seedlings that did not have a mat in terms of their growth. I would recommend and I plan on buying more.
1262,433,3,"Its all plastic except the hanging device. It is easy to setup - the bottoms screw off and you pour the water or seed into each holder and flip them over. It is a little tricky if you try to fill them both then take the whole thing outside and hang it. Best to fill the seed, hang it then come back with the water. Looks ok nothing spectacular. We'll have to see how it holds up year around."
1216,878,5,"I will freely admit that I don't like killing animals.However, a few years ago, we realized that our house was gradually being invaded by mice. They would typically move in at the end of Summer, and keep us company during the long Winter evenings. The occasional cache of seeds, or scattering of mouse droppings, gave us the first clue. Then we noticed holes gnawed in our bags of bird food (stored in the basement in the winter). Not good.The last straw was when I saw a little shadowy reflection pattering across our wooden floor, its owner hidden by the sofa, while we were watching TV. The clincher came a few days later when I looked into our kitchen waste bin, and saw two little beady eyes looking back at me.We looked into a number of options. We tried an electronic mouse repellent thingy, which didn't work at all. We considered and rejected the crueller traps, particularly those nasty adhesive ones. We even tried a 'humane' trap, which malfunctioned and broke the poor little guy's back. Traumatic for all concerned.Finally, we bought a Rat Zapper. It worked perfectly, as advertised: the only sign of a kill is a flashing red light. Within a few weeks, we had killed, and disposed of over a dozen mice. As far as we can tell, it does the deed quickly and efficiently, and you can inhume the deceased by taking the device to the end of the garden and shaking it with the open end downwards. If you don't want to look at the poor little chap, you don't have to.There were only a couple of shortcomings in the Rat Zapper, both of which seem to be addressed by its replacement, the Ultra.The original Zapper used four AA cells, which meant that it was somewhat picky about the type of batteries. The makers recommended Duracell Ultras, and strongly recommended against any lesser breed. The new device uses four D cells, and although the documentation still recommends Duracell Ultras (which aren't available in D size, by the way) it grudgingly admits that good quality alkaline batteries will be perfectly adequate. There is also some talk about using the much more expensive Lithium cells, but I suspect this has got more to do with shelf life than actual performance. We're using standard Duracells.The original Zapper tried to use a singe LED to indicate multiple events, including both low battery and successful euthanasia. This could get confusing at times. The new one uses separate LEDs to denote system functionality and 'mission accomplished'.I'm not sure why, by the new device has a rather attractive retro 'streamlined' design. My son thought that it looked like an Airstream camper, or perhaps even the 20th Century Limited, ready to leave Grand Central. Charming thought, but I can't imagine that the mice will notice.Very effective for mouse control (and chipmunks)."
0,235,5,"This rake is the perfect tool to use in my raised garden bed. It is small enough to get between the plants but wide enough to get the job done. The aluminum handle and the plastic tines make for a lightweight tool that is easy to handle. The rake is held in place on the handle with just a single screw which makes it easy to replace should that become necessary. This is a nice companion to its cousin, the Fiskars garden rake which I use mostly to rake magnolia leaves. This shrub rake also does a good job of raking the leaves between the shrubs that surround my house.This shrub rake is reasonably priced and a very handy addition to my Fiskars collection. It is a worthwhile purchase."
1466,762,5,"Like everything else, gardening has changed over the last 70 years.  Clips like these are part of the change.  They will definitely be helpful during growing season.  They give ample room for growth, and are quite simple to use, to dlip on and lock.  The green leaf shape is an added bonus feature for the looks of the addition.  The price for 20 of these clips is reasonable.  This indeed is a recommended purchase for those who love their gardens."
1160,570,4,"This actually works. It's important to blow some Diatomaceous Earth into crevices including outlets and anywhere bedbug juveniles, eggs, or adults can hide. Without this device, I'm not sure that I could have conquered the problem. Don't overfill this and check to see that you are still blowing some product out from time to time. Some reviewers appeared to have had difficulty regulating the amount of material that is blown and others with it clumping or piling. It takes a little while to get the hang of it."

626,212,5,"Highest quality and just simply works as it should! Can't go wrong with this product. I got a great deal on it when I purchased it from Amazon. If you use a weed trimmer to edge you yard you need to stop and buy one of these attachments and do it right. Weed trimmers will do a lot of harm when used incorrectly. These lawn edgers will allow you to only remove just the amount of dirt with the grass that is needed as compared to weed trimmers used incorrectly. I had someone take care of my edging last summer and he used a weed trimmer to do the edging and what started out being a nice 1/2"" border ended up being a 3"" border by the end of summer. I had to buy several bags of top soil to replace the dirt that the weed trimmer threw to the wind. Great product and a great buy on Amazon."

It appeared carefully packaged with peanuts and plastic along with the coffee plant that came in the same box. The plant is a healthy deep green and I see no visible sign of any infestation. It came in a 8"" pot per the specifications and measures almost exactly 18"" tall. (this includes the root system) It had a half dozen or so fruits on it...the largest one being about the circumference of a half-dollar. I did find one broken branch that appears to have happened during packaging but I will not hold it against them as the plant seems very healthy overall and has new growth on it. It does not quite have the showroom look of the photo but is very pleasing in my opinion."
336,914,3,"I don't even know if we have Orioles here in Arizona, but this wild bird feeder has been attracting some pretty interesting feathered friends to feed.  I have several different species of hummingbird and they seem attracted to this feeder and &#34;taste&#34; the jelly before going to their own hummingbird feeder in another tree nearby.  It's so hot here in Arizona that the jelly doesn't stay solid for long - it turns liquidy and runs into the tray.  I'm glad I only started with a small amount otherwise it might have been all over the tree & ground!  I was afraid it might attract ants, but I haven't seen any heading up the tree so far.  3 star review for a hot environment - but those in more temperate environments might have a higher review of this item."
384,821,4,"We got all excited at our home when we discovered the first mouse of the season. When I say excited, I don't mean in a good way. >:-&lt;. Not happy at all.First we gave a long lecture to the cats about their proper responsibilities. They seemed suitably impressed as they licked their paws and gave us the ""bored cat"" look. Somehow, I didn't count on their assistance!So we now have three chihuahuas, two cats, and a six year old to worry about in setting the traps. How to catch one little mouse without endangering any of them.I first tried the little one that uses the rubber band that snaps off onto the mouse. OOOPS, within a couple of minutes our rescue chihuahua had found it and been ""shot"" by the rubber band. She has probably sworn off peanut butter for life.Since I had just received this from Vine, I thought I'd give it a try. It seemed suitably pet safe.So we put the peanut butter on the bottom and set the trap. First we dealt with the six yer old who wanted to know if the mouse would eat the peanut butter after we caught it. (We said yes).  Five minutes later I walk in and discover the youngest of the dogs with the trap carefully turned over, licking the peanut butter off of the bottom. Sigh.We waited till the dogs were in their kennels for the night and reset it. Sadly, the trap worked about as well as the cats - nothing caught so far.I suspect time will tell, and am continuing to use this. Last year, my husband set multiple traps and injured multiple fingers. We joked about our husband ""catch and release"" program. This trap is very easy to set and can catch up to three mice at a time. It really works pretty much the same as the traditional ones, except the mice need to be tempted inside to be trapped.If this doesn't work, I will go back to the traditional traps and buy a case of band aids. However, if we actually catch mice using this, I will increase the stars to 5 AND buy a bunch more to hide in places the dogs don't go."
841,755,5,"This is our second hand push mower. The **other** brand's mower handle was always coming loose and the flimsy foam rubber was breaking off. When given a chance to review the Fiskars 6208 17 Inch Staysharp Push Reel Lawn Mower, I jumped on it. The mower came in a large and sturdy box and was put together in just a couple of minutes. My spouse mowed the yard several times with it and said that it is superior to the other mower. I mowed only part of the yard to try it out. This one is heavier and about as wide than the other. Neither model catches every tall weed in one go, but this model doesn't catch and stop you dead in your tracks as often as the other one. I was hoping to use this mower many times before I wrote the review, but we are having a drought and it may be months before I have to mow again.  My yard is a small, level town lot and pushing this mower did not wear me out. So far we are very happy with the Fiskars."
792,700,5,"I feel absolute love for a specific rose which goes by the name of &#34;Black Magic&#34; Roses!  They are extremely hard to purchase and if you can, you have to order way in advance, like a year or two and wait all that time just to be told your order is being canceled and you are being refunded because they have no more as they have over ordered the product( Which is now the 6th year in a row they have done this to me)!  How is that my fault right?  anyway back to the review!  I apologize for the tangent!1.  Before we begin with directions here is something that all of you needto know as I have been asked this so many times before, which is Abouthow to properly cut a stem.a.  For those who do not know the proper way to cut a stem off, You willwant the proper shears for this and make sure they are good qualityand extra sharp as if they are dull you will ruin the whole plant you cut it from.b.  If you happen to (like me) acquire a flower from a florist you will want to get thatstem home and under luke warm water (room temperature) you will submergethe stem and take your sharp shears and cut just a half inch off the bottom ina slanted cut as so your flower does not sit directly onto the bottom of the vaseor your stem will not be able to soak up the nutrients it need to grow roots or evensoak up water.  Instead it will just die!2.  First and foremost DO NOT rush!a.  You DO want to apply Clonex generously (by Dipping at least 1 whole inch on thebottom of the cut off stem into the bottle as so you know it has been saturated!).b.  When you have done that, you will then want to place this into a small single flowervase.c.  If you do not have one you can purchase one at your local florist or hardware store.An even cheaper option is to buy one at your local dolor store like Dollar Tree.You dont need a fancy one.d.  If you Rush you WILL end up with a dead stem and NO new flower or tree or whatever else you are trying to grow!3.  You will need lots of flower food.a.  If you are like me and you dont have alot of money, you can use other alternatives theonly problem is if you cut corners with the flowers you are going to see what happens tothe flower when you try to cut corners!b.  Buying a plant food from your local florist or garden center is best!  They do have cheapfood for flowers.c.  Make sure you buy the appropriate foods tho!  If you happen to try and clone roses, youwill need rose food.  If you try to clone a vegetable, you will need vegetable food.  If youtry to clone a tree, you will need the appropriate foods for it.d.  Basically what I am saying is some plants require a very acidic type food and nutrient forthem to grow and thrive as well as make flowers and so on, and some cannot have anyor too much acidity or they will die.  If you dont use the appropriate foods you can andwill kill them.e.  I see alot of people who have said this does not work, well they are full are it, or theyjust do not know the proper steps to take!4.  Making water for the Vase.a.  Before you place the stem into the vase you will want to make up the water and plantfood solution.b.  You will add luke warm(or ROOM TEMPERATURE) water along with the plant food intothe water and let it dilute.c.  You will then mix the water and plant food in the water until it has dissolved.d.  After it has diluted by mixing it and letting it settle for a minute or so you will then take the next steps!5.  Placing the Stem in the vase.a.  After you place your Stem in the vase you will leave it in there until you see it actually root!b.  You will want to change the water and add more plant food like the above steps in steps4 a-d at least every 3 days so it is not sitting in stagnant water.c.  Plants can survive after being cut without water for about three days before they start towilt unless they are left in the sun which in that case will wilt even sooner!  So on that noteyou will want the freshest cut flower to do this with or you will wind up with a rotting flowerin the water, regardless of how cautious you are!6.  Patience is A Virtue!a.  If you are as impatient as some people are here you can take your chances and actuallyplace the flower in the dirt after submerging the stem in the clonex, but I would not suggest it!b.  In the cut stage you dont want to risk it as if you forget to water the flower even one day asthese need to be watered twice a day or more depending on the temperature outside thenyou risk the entire process going to crud!c.  Its up to you. You either want results or dont!7.  When to place it in the ground!a.  Only after you actually see roots(which can be really tiny) will you actually place the stemin the dirtb.  Before placing the stem in the ground you will need to maker sure the ground has been that has beenaerated and fertilizer has been added to it!c.  If it is too cold outside make sure you have a pot that is big enough for your plant.d.  The best way to measure a pot so you know it will be big enough is to take the rootsand measure it with a ruler on a piece of paper then mark the other side of the paperuntil you have a whole circle then you will take that and figure you will need at least twoinches bigger then that circle(as you will need to make sure you have enough room for growth).e.  If you have grown this indoors, you are probably wondering (If you dont already know)when to place this new plant of yours outside to acclimate to the weather(as you cannotbring the plant outside and just place it in a hole right away!  You need to give it at least2 or 3 days to adjust to your yard before placing it in the ground!f.  You will dig a hole that is at least 1' deep and if the stem is bigger you will want to dig a holethat is big enough for your stem!g.  Do not try to cut corners like I have said again and again above as you will not get the resultsyou are looking for!  It will only end in disaster!If you have questions please feel free to ask as I will always be available to answer any questions!  Also if anyone feels I am missing something please let me know as I feel like I have missed something!  I guess I will figure it out!"
1323,371,3,it catches hot meat fluids and can hold a lot.  i am surprised how much fluid this thing can handle.
126,13,3,"I originally purchased this to keep stray cats out of my raised beds.  The material, however, is too flimsy and if the cat (or any other large animal) really wanted to get into the beds, it wouldn't have too much trouble cutting through the netting with its claws.  So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.  I'm thinking I can get at least one, maybe two, season's worth of use before I have to throw it out and start with fresh material.  Next time around, I will look for a stronger material that I can reuse for more than a couple of years."
613,851,3,"Perky Pets is a consumer responsive company and that's a good place to start this review.I have tried several of their products including 2 other Hummingbird Feeders. One feeder broke within the first month when the plastic screw base broke in the desert heat. I've got to admit, I break under the heat too, My wife called the company and the gentleman on the consumer line recommended this design of all metal base with glass container.The GOOD1. No plastic to break.2. Large mason blue glass container that holds plenty.3. It can sit in your sink on its flat glass bottom (which is directed up when in use) and is easy to clean with no extra brushes to buy.4. It's attractive to humans.The BAD1. Hummingbirds will sit on the metal surround perch occasionally but they don't particularly like it and they don't hang out like they do with other feeders. This is even though we have moved it to the birds' favorite prime location. My take is that the metal surrounding perch is not like a branch twig and doesn't feel so good as it gets heated.2. Because the hummers don't ""Hang Out"" we don't see them feed like we are use to seeing.3. They don't buzz us when the feeder gets low.The  (potentially) UGLY1. The metal base does not have threads into which to screw the Mason jar. Rather it has four,  inch vertical protruding (let's call them) anchors, which hold the Mason jar in place on the base.  You screw the jar into the base anchors and if you haven't applied level pressure the jar may be off kilter and leak when placed upright.2. I have not had this problem. But -- I can foresee a heavier bird trying to steal water and causing the base to drop off because of their weight.  The jar screws pretty tightly to the base and this major ant attracting incident may never happen. And if it does, I don't imagine the base will break. It's just curious to me that there are no screw threads. I'll report if it ever happens but I am holding my breath.This is a good, attractive feeder. I just hope the hummers will think so come the cooler 8 months of the year. I need also mention that the water level keeps dropping so birds are feeding. It's just not dropping so quickly as I would expect in the hot summer."
1558,78,4,"I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment."
1421,616,5,"Whoever came up with this product deserves a lot of credit.  I was using a standard ocillating back-and-forth sprinkler.  It did an ok, job, but with all of the contours of my front lawn, it really never was efficient at getting water to where it needed, and keeping it away from the areas that it didn't. Because we live on a corner lot, getting water to the follow the curb was impossible without overspraying on the road.With this product, not only does this cover a huge area, but it allows you to precisely configure where you want the water to go.  The red ring allows you to raise or flatten the surface which a guide follows.  There are I would estimate 15 areas along the red ring that allow for adjustment.  The higher you raise it, the lower and therefore shorter the water shoots.  Sounds kind of strange, but the guide follows along the back side of where the water comes out. Think of a see-saw.  When one side is on the ground, the other is aimed higher.  And as it pivots, the angle of the opposide side changes. The higher the aim, the furtuer it shoots.  The more shallow the aim, the shorter it shoots.  Very simple, yet effectively implemented in this device.Few things I would suggest. Because it does take about 5 minutes (depending on the shape of your lawn) to get it properly aimed to the areas you want to cover, I would suggest either purchasing multiple units so once they are setup, you don't need to spend additional time adjusting it each time you move it, or using a permanent marker and writing around the ring of the height that is used.Also, I would mark a spot in the grass with a small object so you know where to place it again without having to recalibrate it.  I can't speak to how long it will last, but it does seem to be a solid device, and without dropping it or damaging it, it should last for quite some time.I love simple and innovative ideas, and this product is one of them."
875,905,5,"This is kind of a fun metal foot shaped thing that helps compact the leaves into a bag or trash can when raking them up. I usually use my hands and so when I saw this product, I thought it might be perfect to help with raking. It's a good invention and works well, although I wouldn't consider it a &#34;must have&#34;. I am still rating it 5 stars since it is good quality, fairly heavy (which is a good thing) and seems like it will last a while.The tool attaches to the end of a rake or you can just get an unused broom handle and put it on there if you have multiple people working on the yard at once. The bright color and fun shape helps make raking appear to be fun to kids, so that's always a plus as well."
338,885,5,"After opening the box, I was looking for the manual.  Turns out that the small pamphlet inside is actually the manual -- that's how easy it is to use this device.You can often tell a quality device by the small things.  In this case, I noticed instantly that the zippers to the pocket that holds the cables run smooth and have a nice extender to grab.  The panels come in a small folder about the size of a computer tablet (e.g., iPad) and everything you need is all in the folder including the cables.  There is a nice strong magnet that prevents the tablet from opening on its own.Below are the results from my little test.  I took a smart phone and ran down the battery to 54%.  I then connected it to the charger and angled the panels at the sun.2:04pm - 54% (start)2:38pm - 78%3:28pm - 98%The device was probably near 100% around 3pm to be honest but I forgot to check sooner.  After the test, I decided to place the device in the shade while still connected to the phone out of curiosity.  After 30+ minutes, the device was at 90% so I am not sure if the panels drain the device if connected during long periods of shade or if my phone was acting up.Note the panels have a plastic film over them when shipped that you peel off -- and that is a good thing.  However, I was surprised to see a lot of scuff marks on the panel after I pulled the protector sheets off but thankfully the scratches didn't seem to impact performance.Overall, this panel lives up to the claims.  It's made with high quality and is super easy to use."
1232,770,5,"We have about 40 houseplants (not counting orchids) that I really enjoy having around the house, especially since my wife takes care of them. She has always been a Miracle-Gro fan, as have I from the earlier version of this product that you add to water, to our annual garden startingMiracle-Gro Gro-ables Vegetable and Herb Garden Kit, 18 Seed Pods (Not Sold in CA). This new version of indoor plant food comes as a liquid with a pump bottle that dispenses the product as foam, much like a foaming hand-soap product.It is very easy to use. You just carry the bottle around with you when watering and pump a few dollops of foam onto the dirt around the plant - two pumps for small plants, three or more for larger plants - then water as usual. This also makes it easy to get the correct quantity of nutrients to most any potted plant. The foam does tend to rise a little if you use a rain type watering can, but it quickly dilutes and soaks in, leaving no visible trace in the pot. It's a great product, works as advertised, and the plants are doing just fine. It does seem to run out a little quicker than the stuff you mix with water, but because it is easier to use, I still think it is a five star product."
354,449,3,"This product did help protect my cloths.  In the past I have had good success with cedar blocks.  I would have liked more instruction on using this device, but it is handy and shows results.  It could have been made easier to hang, but it is simple to punch a hole through the trap.  Overall an inexpensive way to safeguard your clothes."
1147,880,5,"I've never been particularly happy with garden hoses. If they are long enough to reach from my spigot to the target plants or car, they usually kink in the middle of my work, leading to my walking back, unkinking the hose, and then continuing with my work - over and over again. Or after a year or two, they develop multiple pinhole openings in the hose material, resulting in my getting soaked every time I water the plants. They're inevitably heavy, difficult to reel back in, and overall just a pain in the neck.Now meet the Rumford Expanding Hose. This is a truly lightweight hose that weighs about a pound when empty. It reaches its full length when there is some pressure build-up in the hose. That is, if the opening is wide open, the hose is fractionally shorter than its full length, but if you close it down a bit (and there's a built-in control if you don't want to get a separate nozzle), you get the full length of the hose.The hose doesn't kink, doesn't leak, and quickly returns to its starting length and weight once you've turned off the source and allowed the water to drain out. A tiny carrying case comes with the hose and rather amazingly holds the hose once emptied. You no longer need to leave a big hose sitting outside your home, nor do you have to schlep a heavy hose in and out of your garage or toolshed."
891,588,4,"I've never owned a pressure washer before so I can't compare this one to anything else.  I bought it to clean the copping and deck around my pool after a pool renovation. I couldn't afford to replace my pool copping or deck so I opted to pressure wash these areas and bring them back to life.  I have to say that this machine is pretty powerful.  My pool copping and deck sparkled by the time I was done.  But I was so excited about how clean they got I cleaned just about everything else with the pressure washer too... My BBQ grill got a good cleaning, the exterior walls of my house where my dogs brush up against is now clean, and the covered patio was rinsed down and now looks like the color it was meant to be.  I think next weekend I'll wash the garage door and driveway.  This was definitely a good investment.  I hope it lasts.  Oh, one thing to note is that the thing that reels up the hose sucks big time!  I couldn't figure out how to reel it up, attach it and unreel it to use the hose.  The instructions for this also suck.  I just roll up the hose and wrap it around the handle."
886,923,4,"I ended up getting this bird feeder and putting it out for a test run right away. Turns out that at least around here in Central Texas where I am at the birds seem to be enjoying it more so than the squirrels. Now don't get me wrong a few have tried for it [at least that I have noticed] but I get more birds out back on this.  The only problem I have had thus far is that it gets moved around easily by the wind, naturally no birdies come a feeding at that time."
389,296,5,"I purchased.. I'm not even sure. Eight of these? And they have all done the trick. They are lining both my garden and my fence. The fence is to keep weeds out of the garden, and keep some toads out of our yard (as much as possible).I have had no issues with these, although I did lay them out flat (with heavy objects on each end) the day before. This made them MUCH easier to work with. I saw the suggestion in another review.For anyone interested, these also cut easily with saws. I used a 5 inch electric to cut to fit certain areas."
110,668,4,"I have used just about every major brand of reel mower and this is the most versatile and easiest to use mower of them all.First, this mower has some heft to it. The reel itself is heavy, and they weight is essential to get the momentum to plow through thick grass.  Also, heavy reel mowers stay on the ground mowing instead of bouncing up in bumpy ground.This mower has an excellent handle, too.  The fiskars mower has a heavy duty, stiff handle that should last a really long time.  It blows away the terrible handle of the scotts classic(which is otherwise a pretty good mower.  Still the momentum handle is not as stiff or as strong as the old Agri-Fab reel mower, but it makes up for lacking stiffness by being adjustable. One small weakness to the handle of the momentum is the grip.  It is a cheap foam padding that will likely only last a couple seasons.Cutting height adjustment is maybe where the momentum shines the most.  It is the easiest mower to adjust cutting height of any reel mower and it also has the widest range of cutting heights.  When mowing a really out of control lawn it is nice to be able to mow really high.  Then if you want, you can cut it again at a little lower level.This mower cuts like a pair of scissors where the blade does not actually touch the bed knife.  That means that you will not need to sharpen the fiskars for a really long time.  I have old mowers with this system that are fifty years old and do not need professional sharpening.  I just backlap them every several years and they stay sharp.  I expect the same with this fiskars, and will probably never need to get it sharpened.The drive mechanism is all on the right, so the mower can cut almost flush up against barriers on the left.  That is very handy when cutting along borders.Unlike most mowers, this mower throws the grass to the front.  That helps chop up the trimmings more finely.  In long, thick grass it does mean going over the same grass twice, making a little more work.  Fortunately the mower has the power to handle it.What caused me to buy this and use it over my old Agri-Fabs, which are awesome, is the ease of cutting through thick grass.  Fiskars says the chain allows it to release built up momentum and give extra power.  That is true.  This thing has great power.That chain is the big downside to this mower also.  Chains need to be lubricated to run right, and eventually chains stretch or break.  My chain broke in the first year, and fiskars was very slow in getting back to me.  They say they have fixed the chain issue, but someday all chains wear out.  Too bad, because otherwise this thing is built to last almost forever.If you want the most powerful, easiest to use reel mower available buy this fiskars momentum.  If you do not need quite as much power, but want one that can indeed last almost forever buy the very fine replica of the agri-fab mowers from mascot.Mascot Silent Cut 18 Deluxe Reel Mower - In Stock!"
148,470,5,"There are usually numerous fire ant mounds in my horse pastures and all over my lawn in the summer. It has gotten so much worse over the last few years that I had vowed to do something about it. At the beginning of the summer I treated the visible nests, mounds, hills, whatever you want to call the forts from which the fire ants attack humans - just kidding, sort of. I should have remembered that treating the home of the ants will get rid of them by driving them down and over to another location unless you go deep with the treatment.So I was clipping a hedge in my front flowerbed when my legs started stinging horribly. I looked down and there were fire ants all over my legs and ankles, all the way up to the knees. I was standing in the middle of a mound the size of my kitchen table - about four feet in diameter. After swatting and smacking and dancing around and taking my shoes off and banging them on the ground, I got rid of the ants, but of course not before they had bitten me in about 20 or 30 places. The bites itched so badly I was nearly wild with a need to tear my skin off. The expected little blisters full of venom formed shortly after and I won't go into what I went through for two days after that.As the sun rose on the third day, I picked up my bag of Terro Ant Killer and, with a grim gleam in my eye, I made my way to the enemy lines. It was all over pretty quickly. I shook out the Terro and wet it down with the hose. The bag would have done a larger area, but I wanted it to saturate and go down as far as the ant tunnels reached so I used all 3 pounds of it. After a couple of days I was assured the mound was neutralized  and I have yet to see another eruption in the lawn, the pastures or the flower beds.Again, the key to fighting ants is to go deep. Just destroying the ones outside the nest or even a couple of inches down is only going to make them divide to conquer. Terro seems to do the job."
1273,189,4,"I set these up a few weeks ago.  It is difficult to know just how successful they have been as I don't know how much additional damage I would have gotten without them and I have never seen a deer touching a unit.  I have had plants less than 10 feet away eaten, so these will be added to my normal arsenal of spraying and fencing but not counted on as the only solution.  They would work best in a situation where the deer enter in one small area, like a driveway or gate.  Unfortunately, my local deer have numerous paths and seem to be passing these by. I did touch the units to make sure they are working and to see how bad the shock is (I have a puppy that I did not want harmed) and the it is very mild -  enough to scare, but not enough to cause any harm.  I am glad these weren't around when I was a child or my big brother would have somehow gotten me to put my tongue on them, so watch out that your kids or neighbor kids don't get that idea."
1238,196,4,I was having such a problem getting the squirrels to stay out of my vegtables/corn I almost did not put a garden up this year. But I am glad I did-I sprayed this around the perimeter of my garden for two days and watched and waited. Did not see any paw prints in my garden and no little bits off the fruit either.Worked great!
357,810,3,"I cleared some drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard for fire prevention.  The gophers that were digging countless holes in the hard dirt of the slope decided to relocate to my backyard lawn.  It is &#34;ON&#34;, varmints!  I've tried gopher repellents, gas bombs, traps, solar spike deterrents, and baits, with varying results.  Why not give this Tomcat Mole and Gopher Repellent a try?Likes:*Easy to apply using a garden hose connected to the bottle/applicator.*Claimed by manufacturer to treat 10,000 sq. ft.Results:*I followed the instructions precisely and sprayed the entire 45x45ft.  backyard lawn with plenty of the deterrent liquid left over.  For the first two weeks, the gopher activity seemed to have ceased.*During the third week, gopher dug new smaller holes in other locations that branched out from the original gopher mound.Overall:Did deter the gophers for two weeks from digging holes near the original site but the damn critters simply branched out to other locations with less deterrent scent.  In order to end gopher destruction, these varmints need to be dead, not just deterred.  The battle continues."
528,622,2,I have used Sluggo snail and slug killer and some other brand from Home Depot. I found that this one didn't seem to last as long as the others once it got wet. I also didn't like the fact that the product seemed to break down in the package and create a dust that poofed out as you shook the bottle around to dispense it. I never noticed that with the other brands. I'm pretty sure that all three work in the same way so I think I will be sticking with one of the others. How is it going to work if it is gone before they can get to it?
1579,46,4,"I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength, get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect, they're not for heavy-duty cutting, and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore,  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain, I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*"
1281,524,2,"The Perky-Pet Magnolia Hummingbird Feeder looks, at first glance, like a great feeder. Similar to many modern hummingbird feeders on the market, it's plastic, so it's light-weight. It has perches for the hummingbirds to sit on.However, we've been feeding hummingbirds for twenty years now, so we've tested a wide variety of feeders. When we put this feeder out, we put it into a spot which was getting a swarm of hummingbirds. We also put one of our normal, plastic hummingbird feeders near it.The hummingbirds would examine this - but absolutely refuse to use it. They went to the other one.We switched locations. Again, they refused to use this one. They'd try it out, try to stuff their beaks into the holes, and give up. They'd go back to the other one which was easier to use.Finally we removed the other feeder so they were forced to use this one. They might sip for a second or two - and then they'd take off. Yes - they will GO to it. But they won't actively USE it as much as they use the other feeders.We didn't have any problems with leakage. That normally happens if you don't fill and seal a feeder properly so the vacuum isn't formed. So it's not that leakage was a problem. It's that the tiny hole shape was one the hummingbirds disliked. Also, I think the ""cute"" leaves on the perches make it harder for them to land.There are so many other awesome hummingbird feeders on the market that are lightweight, plastic, and that hummingbirds adore. I just don't see any reason to use this. We experimented with it for two solid months during prime hummingbird season. The hummingbirds voted with their wings. They wanted nothing to do with this one.Normally we give away old feeders we aren't using any more, so friends can use them. This one, sadly, is going in the trash. I wouldn't want to subject anybody to the poor results this one gives, given how many great feeders are out there.We purchased this feeder with our own funds."
858,60,5,This is a nice item when you want to keep your food off the cast iron grates.  Useful for numerous food items.  Good quality.
501,76,4,"This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition."
0,233,5,"I did a bunch of pruning with ease using these fine shears. However, when I tried to lock them shut I could not get the lock arm to return to its initial position to lock the shears closed. I decided to check the reviews again more thoroughly to see if others had the same problem. A reviewer suggested loosening the Phillips screw holding the lock arm. I followed that advice and the result removed the slight negative feeling I had toward these shears and now all is well. These may well be the best shears I have ever owned."
540,832,5,"A family of deer usually visit my backyard and last year they ventured to the side of the house and ate nearly all the leaves off my cucumber and tomato plants. I planted my garden this year and have been spraying this product around the area they frequent in the back and so far so good. I don't see any evidence that they have been eating my plants, and I haven't seen any in the yard. I'm hoping that this continues.The product should not be sprayed on vegetable plants."
1391,493,2,"I&#8217;m not having any kind of luck with these whereas the &#8220;regular&#8221; Tomcat traps are actually doing the trick.  That&#8217;s not to say they won&#8217;t work for some people because I have a friend who is rather squeamish and uses this type all the time.She is using them on counters for the little city mice, but we have field mice that simply seem to bypass these.  Perhaps it&#8217;s because the baited traps are open, but I&#8217;m not sure.  They are easy to set up and are no hassle, but perhaps not worth the expense.There&#8217;s a small &#8220;door,&#8221; if that&#8217;s what you call it, on the bottom of the trap that can be removed and baited.  The directions on the back of the box, which include visuals, are quite clear and easy to follow.I&#8217;ve never had any luck with this type of trap before and it looks like they aren&#8217;t going to work for me again.  For what you get, these are way too expensive and I&#8217;m not enamored with throwing out such a large piece of plastic for one mouse.  Not for me, but maybe for the ultra-squeamish who can&#8217;t approach it any other way."
1019,729,2,"Don't expect this to remove the Green Stuff from your siding just with water and spray. You still need to get on a ladder and scrub. I don't see any special results with this cleaner. In fact, I have better results with Simple Green. I can't recommend this."
1055,228,4,"This is a very nice heavy-duty firepit. The only problem with it is that the screened lid is just not high enough to allow the burning of enough wood. So, I keep having to remove the lid to add wood. There are replacement covers that are much more rounded and higher.I like the edge all around that allows you to put your feet on it when the fire has burned down a bit. The cast iron construction will allow this unit to last for many years.Every year, I wire brush the screen lid and spray paint with black fire resistant grill paint and it lasts all season."
437,828,4,"I have used several of these type of products.  So far, this seems like the best constructed. I particularly appreciate the metal spike. It has worked well against deer in my yard.The real test this year will be the birds however.  I really need to keep them from eating my blueberries.  No product so far has been successful.  I cannot comment yet on this so I will add an addendum but I am not optimistic.This goes together easily and I had no trouble understanding how it works.There is one issue however that I would warn people about.  It isn't the devices fault but is an issue with this type device that you must be aware of.  The hose is under pressure at all times.  It sits in the hot sun.  Every hose I have used so far has eventually burst.  They all have a warning about this.  It is a disaster every time because the water runs and runs.  In my case, with a well, I eventually lose water entirely.  You need to have a high enough quality hose that won't burst.  So far, I haven't seen one without a warning.. The warning says not to keep constant pressure.  Since  you need to do this with this device, I am wondering if anyone out there (or the manufacturer) has any suggestions.The alternative is the sprayer that has its own reservoir."
240,644,5,"I say that because the trap can be a bit difficult to get used to, especially if you have not used one before. Just practice opening and closing it because when you actually do use it to trap an animal, you won't have time to read the instructions on what to do to release, etc.!This is our 3rd Havahart trap.  We have a smaller one and a larger one. I really like this size - the #1062 - for rescuing feral kittens and very small cats.  You certainly would not want to use it for a large cat because it is not made for that and the cat could be constricted to the point it might get hurt.Havahart traps are the best and the most humane and in my opinion, the easiest to use, especially the 2 door traps.  If you are transporting a feral cat to a vet for spay/neutering, they can easily be released into a carrier or a cage.We are not in an area with skunks or squirrels, but do have cats and rabbits.  We have rabbit rescues in the area who will help relocate them.Again, this size is made for exactly what it says - rabbits, skunks and squirrels.If you are looking for a Havahart to trap larger animals such as feral or lost and scared cats, buy the #1045.  That's the one we have.I would also suggest after you set the trap to cover the top and sides with a dark fabric so the animal can't see the actual trap. Lots of rescue groups make covers out of old sheets with an opening on the top to allow the handle to be accessible.  The cats are then transported with the cover still on.  Helps also if you have trapped an unneutered male/female cat and they spray!There are lots of 'humane' traps out there on the market, but if you truly want a trap that is humane and will not hurt the animal and is well constructed, buy Havahart. You don't EVER want to see an animal - in our case a cat - whose leg gets caught when that door slams down....trust me on that :(  At that time, we didn't know there was a difference in the quality and construction of live animal traps and there definitely is."
119,791,5,"I went for the Toro Ultra over the other Toro models because my wife loves to shred leaves for mulch. While the other models do shred leaves this is the only one with metal blades. I've only used this blower/vac for one season, but it has been great.My only complaint is the size of the bag for the vacuum - it fills up after sucking up leaves in a 4'x4' area so I am constantly stopping to dump the shredded leaves."
1232,703,3,"This product is advertised as a substitute for whatever you might normally put in the bottom of a planter or pot, and for that purpose, it works well enough. But this is one of those things that reminds me of a banana hanger: Yeah, it works and everything, but so what? My bananas do perfectly well on the counter and not on a hanger, and my plants do perfectly well with a bed of rocks or drainage gravel in the bottom of the pot and not a fancy drainage pad. About the only thing that might be considered an advantage of these things would be if you were in it for the weight reduction, or you just don't want to go and find some rocks. Then again, I actually prefer to have rocks in the bottom of my plant pots, because that extra weight helps keep them stable in high wind and rain conditions. So, if you're looking to lighten your pots (maybe you want to put them on a light duty shelf?) or you really, really hate messing with rocks, these are for you, but I think 9 out of 10 gardeners can get by perfectly well without them. (As another reviewer noted, they do make great scrubbers, though.)"
1157,499,4,"There are lots of decent kebob sets out there, and for the most part, all do their jobs acceptably well. Most are priced well below this set. But if you're as interested in presentation as much as you are taste, the higher price of this set is worth it.The shape and finish are very nice, and unlike a couple other reviewers, I found the quality of both workmanship and materials to be excellent. The double skewers do a great job of preventing skewered items from just rolling loosely when you attempt to turn your kebobs over for even cooking.There's plenty of room for nice big hunks of meats, vegetables, fruits, or whatever else you're skewering, too. Many other sets don't leave quite as much room between skewers on the rack, thereby limiting the size of anything you put on the skewers. The trade-off for being able to use larger pieces is that instead of 6 kebobs at a time, which is common with other sets like this, you can only grill five kebobs at a time with this one. That presents no problem here, as we rarely cook for more than four.The real payoff comes when you lift the rack with your finished kebobs out of your grill and carry it to where your guests will be served. They present so much more nicely on this rack. Of course they won't be on that rack for long, just long enough for your guests to see how nice it all looks before being served, but hey, first impressions mean a lot, right? And your guests are worth it!I hope some of you will find my review helpful in making a more informed decision as you consider your buying choices. Peace :-)"
776,867,5,"Review of Terro T3400 Home Insect Killer: Here in Arizona we seem to have a zillion little critters, some very small to as big as your fist.  Here in their desert you would expect to find a little one under every rock.  True, so it is a must to prevent massive outbreaks.  My greatest fight is with ANTS!.  Ants this year have decided to hold their conferences in my garden, patio and in the greenhouse.This year it seemed that the Home defense spray used in the past had no effect to their invasion.I tryed all of the home folk lore recipes!! Nothing could slow down the invasion!So, I decided to try another home brand, to vary their little diets.  I sprayed my entire garden, greenhouses, patio ,in the evening, the following day, I did not notice the invasion, but found that I had missed the storage center and sprayed again, It has been 2 weeks since I sprayed and not seen a caravan of ants.So, this reviewer has the most favorable review of this product.I still have about half of this product left to spray again as the winter sets in, I also noticed that other critters unseen turned up legs in the air!As this was the beginning of our rainy season, we normally get around 2 inches of rain, this season we have already seen in three days around 10 inches.  I was afraid that the home defense would wash away, seems like it is still holding.Very pleased."
552,761,2,"If points are awarded thusly: 1 point to the moles for each day they evade death and 1 point to me for each mole I kill, the current score is Team Mole: eleven, Me: zero.I have obvious active hills and tunnels in my yard and have followed the directions, watched the video and tried 3 different locations and not had the trap spring even once.Not only is it ineffective but it is hard to use.  I can't be sure if I have a defective unit or if there is a design flaw, but my trap is intermittently impossible to set.  There is a catch that should lock into place when you raise the handle,  to hold the spikes up until they are triggered.  It is a constant fight to get mine to catch.  I'd say it works 1 out of 15 attempts.  Furthermore, I'd think by design, it should take minimal motion to spring the trap, if you will a hair trigger, so you'd have the best chance of impaling the vermin.  If I ever do get mine to lock in the set position, it is virtually impossible to get it to trigger.  The little lever on the side seems to jam so you can't spring it manually to test.  You can jostle it, kick it, drpo it from shoulder height and throw it across the yard (which I have in fact DONE) without springing the trap.I'm going to keep trying to get this to work because I really hate moles and what they are doing to my yard.  If I have any success, I will revise my review but for now, I cannot recommend this product."
81,649,5,These strips work well and are easy to use; couldn't be simpler.  Much easier than the pool test kits.  Reasonably accurate and easy to read if you are not color blind.  Bought at Amazon for a fraction of the cost at my local pool store.  I've been using these strips exclusively now for 2 years with no complaints.

976,226,5,"These grass shears joined my backyard arsenal this past spring. I bought an old style reel mower a couple of years ago and have been in the need of a manual pair of shears ever since for the ""holidays"" it leaves.  Unlike a lot of things that I buy, I did no shop around for a cheaper model on this purchase.  I had some old grass shears that have been around for decades and had just about had it.  My neighbor bought this very same Ames model and I was totally impressed with it.  When it comes to a pair of these shears, it really does come down to the beef and quality of the construction.  For just about all of them are made with the same system in mind.  When I went to the store to buy these, I was able to compare all the different models side by side.  I had pretty much made up my mind to get this pair after borrowing my neighbors, but comparing them up front and personal solidified that decision.  These babies are as quality built as they come and should last a lifetime if taken care of. They are well padded and comfortable, extremely sharp, and make it a breeze to snip any grass or weeds.  (Also, personally I have not had any problem with the blade holding pin locking itself without accidentally. Someone else here did, and I thought it only fair I say that for me that has not been a problem at all).  If you have need of a pair of grass shears like these look no further.  In my opinion they are the best you will find without moving up to a power model.  They are a pleasure to use and friendly on the environment.  Highly recommended..."
1114,678,5,"The Envirocycle Composter is simple to use.  It has a latched door on the front.  This is my one complaint.  The latch is a hook-shaped piece of metal flush with the surface and can get a little tight.  But this is not that big a deal.  The base has a set of 6 wheels that make rotating the drum a snap.  There are 2 vents on each side as well as a bottom drain that goes into the hollow base.  This allows you to capture the compost tea separately.Each day I through my compostable material in and give it a spin.  Granted, when it starts getting more than 1/2 full, it is a little harder to turn, but not too bad.  It is important that base be on as flat ground as possible to facilitate the turning.Then, when it is time to empty out, I can just roll the composter over to the garden and empty.  No need for a wheel barrow.This is a great composter!!!"
1271,312,4,"Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know."
1235,928,5,This was easy to apply with our spreader. I had no problems with clogging. The difference was almost immediate. My lawn was noticeably greener in a couple weeks time. I would buy this again and recommend it.
851,715,5,"I have a storage facility I use for some household items that is offsite, in a group of storage areas surrounded by farm fields.  Needless to say, late summer into winter the rodents flock for a warmer place to live.  I use Tomcat products, and find that they work safely, fast and always do the job.  Highly recommended.  Be sure you do not utilize poisons around your animals, some will no doubt discover dead rodents and may try to eat them."
1389,722,5,"The Garden Genius Pot Filler is wonderful. It is lightweight, looks kind of like a Brillo pad prior to use. It is made of a durable, spongy, and airy plastic that allows water and air to pass through so that your plants can drain and breathe. I have the 11 1/2 inch size for a big pot, and it worked great to add drainage without heavy rocks, which would have made it harder to move this big pot around. As long as you put in enough soil on top of the filler so that there is plenty of growth room for the roots, there should be no problems. Also, at the end of the season when you are changing out pots, this Pot Filler can be washed and reused."
747,58,4,I bought this to retrofit it on my Genesis platinum series 2 gas grill.  The reason why is that the factory installed tool hooks prevent you from opening the lower grill doors with tools hanging from the hooks.  These are stainless steel and I have figured out how to do this so I am going to relocate them to the side of the work table on the grill.  They will work and last with a little customization.

1578,470,4,"Let me first comments on the brilliant design of the package, for spot treating, i.e. in ""flower beds"" of shrubs, flowers, etc around house foundations, this is the product design one needs to get insect poison to those difficult places where a rotary spreader or even hand spreader will not work well.  This product basically works like a huge salt shaker, and the granules are so light that the package can be handled with ease.Now to the carpenter ants: we had been having a problem with a lot of carpenter ants coming inside our house, from the trees in the yard, they come in not via the tree branches but from the ground.  I used this Terro shaker bag of ant killer, along the two sides of our house where the ants are known to have entered and both are ""flower beds"" full of shrubs and an AC unit.  Watered in the granules per the instructions, after a week, zero ants.  Matter of fact we saw only one ant inside after the granules were put out and that is amazing as we were finding upwards of 6 or more per day earlier.  I recommend this product for carpenter ants."
527,762,4,"Pros:- The clips are easy to use. I'm 6'2&#34; and in possession of fairly large hands and fingers, and I find it easy to hold and install these clips with one hand.- The clips are green and don't stand out amongst the plants (on the con side, the clips are green and so they're harder to find when you need to move them!)- They're strong and secure enough to helpfully attach my plants to their supporting bamboo posts.Cons:- They're not one-size-fits-all - they're too big for little seedlings and not big enough for large plants...but the spectrum of branch sizes that are a good fit is pretty large.- They clip fairly securely...but not perfectly. Or not completely securely. This isn't really a true &#34;con,&#34; however, as this means that the clips are less likely to choke off a growing plant."
233,722,3,"First thing that hit me was that since different pots have different shapes careful of the size you get and how they will fit in the pots. For big pot filler I usually use styrofoam peanuts or just pieces of it, its a lot cheaper (since its free), weighs next to nothing, lets water flow and so on.Free advice for this company, why not make peanuts out of these so they would fit any pot so much easier and you wouldn't have to worry about size and shape. They do as promised in areas that they weigh less, allow water to move, etc.Probably will not get again, have tried two different sizes."
190,838,3,"This hose could work out fine for some and be terrible for others. It would appear there are also some issues with quality control, so it could be hit or miss if your hose leaks or not as soon as you get it. So you may want to keep that in mind when considering which hose to purchase.Pros:Very light weight - This is great for someone like grandma/grandpa who wants to water their small backyard garden, but a traditional hose is too heavy for them to work with. No ones going to throw out their back lifting this, and it's weight would probably be very arthritis friendly.Size - Because it's an expanding hose, this means it contracts back up when water is not flowing through it. So 75 feet of this hose is not nearly as bulky as 75 feet of traditional hose.Cons:Water flow - The diameter of tube inside causes water flow to be lower than traditional hoses. Fine for watering the tomato plants, not so good for washing the car.Build quality - This hose seems much more delicate than traditional hoses. So if you want to make it last, it needs to be handled carefully and stored away out of the elements. In short, it needs to be babied. Not something most of us do with an item usually stored on the floor of our garage or rolled up on the ground in the backyard. A hot summer day with the kids playing around with it could be it's end.Conclusion:This hose will work for the person who needs a hose that is very light weight, and who is delicate with their stuff. My mother could make this hose last years since she takes such good care of her things, and it would be a good match for most of her needs (filling the bird bath, watering outside plants, etc). My husband trying to hose of his 4-wheeler and truck, and my kids using it to spray water on their friends would probably have this leaking and ruined in a week. With the build quality being not so great, I would suggest considering a different hose if you're not wanting to baby this."

717,826,2,"This device is nothing more than a pan and is not something I would use often.  I had Charbroil's Inferred grill and that was a big mistake.  This continues the mistake on a Weber.  Inferred to Charbroil is nothing but a pan between the flames to eliminate the flame.  Wow, now there is a concept.  It is all hype as far as I am concerned and not too useful.  Use a low priced pyrex roaster or a low metal pan and you will get the same thing for much less and probably much easier to clean and store.  This probably won't burn through as fast as the Charbroil grill.  I was skeptical and my fears were confirmed.  Sorry, I find it a dumb product which is not needed.  It is in the garage already.

320,938,4,"This Perky Pet Copper Glass Hummingbird Feeder is physically attractive, with its copper sheathing of its plastic base, while also functional in that the red nectar outlets are not only attractive to hummingbirds, but keep unwanted visitors like bees and wasps out.The great negative here is that while it does come with a single serve package of free nectar powered mix, it is artificially colored red, which if latest research is to be believed, does not attract birds, and simply adds artificial color to their diet. The glass reservoir is easy to clean, and better than a plastic reservoir, for long term use.And so far, local red throated hummingbirds seem to favor this feeder."
704,66,3,"Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end ""squirrel-be-gone"" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day."
1023,167,5,"Where I live, in a town house and a neighborhood, with a fence behind us with a shooting range beyond that. Deer... don't really exist in the area to any great extent.What we do have, however, is squirrels. My fiance likes to feed the birds. It took about 3 months, but sure enough, the squirrels found the feeder. We suffered through this humiliation as nothing seemed to work.Amazon Vine offered this to me to try out, so I did. And we are fairly happy with it.The battery powered sprayer means no more cramped hands... which is really nice.I personally don't love the way it smells when it is applied, but the results speak for themselves and after it dries, I smell nothing.And the best part? After spraying the area around the feeder, the squirrels came around a little, but they really don't seem to like to hang out anymore. They sometimes brave the odor, but usually they just pass on by. It helps that the neighbors have feeders as well... so they have somewhere else to check for food. I would tell them about this stuff, but hey, all's fair in love, war and squirrels!Worth it for me."
1542,553,4,"Each spring, my roses get an orange growth on the underside of their leaves.  It appears soon after the first roses are mature enough to cut for bouquets.  If we can defeat this first onslaught of the fungus, the roses are healthy for the remainder of the year.  Safer 3 in 1 spray is effective when used on a small area.  If I am diligent and catch the rust in its beginning stages, so I only need to spray a few leaves, I love this product.  However, if the fungus gets away from me and an entire bush is affected, it is next to impossible to spray all the leaves on both sides to the point of run-off with this spray bottle.  At that point the gardener has to come in with his industrial sprayer and get down to business.  There is little scent to the Safer 3 in 1, so it isn't obnoxious to use.  But it does leave a very slight flavor in my mouth for several hours afterward, which tells me I have breathed in more fumes than I realized.  It defeats small bits of rose rust, and whiteflies hate it.  It definitely gets put to good use in targeted areas of my garden."
1416,787,3,"Wow.  This Trimmer is excellent!!  Not flawless, but excellent. I own a Black & Decker model.  Standard model, non-adjustable height.  Can convert easily from edger to trimmer.  But this one by Toro, man it is great.  It swivels with a push of a button.  Only one way because it uses a spring action.  Again.  Only one way.  Battery is a 24 volt lithium battery.  Comes with a charger, battery all you need to get it going.I like the telescoping adjustment for length.  It comes with a power save mode, which is basically just a string trimmer adjustment.  Supposedly you save power if the string is shorter than longer.  I guess.  I keep in long.The edging feature is different.  You press the button and it turns into edging position and has a wheel where you can push from behind to edge.  I found this a bit difficult to get used to since you can't see where you are going and sometimes it wiggles.  Great concept, but there is a learning curve.  I guess I have to get used to it.The other thing I feel is a bit lacking is the string length adjustment.  You have to stop the device.  Wait until you hear a ""click"" and then start it up again.  This can get a bit frustrating when the string starts to shorten from use.One thing I would like to see is a ""guide"" to know where to keep the edger straight when edging.  I like edging from the side as opposed to the rear.  That is the only issue with this trimmer.I like the battery because it has a button that you can press to see the power level.  Very nice feature.The trimmer is light so it is not cumbersome to use over a length of time.  I do recommend this unit.  Just remember the learning curve with using the edger."
770,684,5,The range is great and the temps seem pretty accurate. It's a great tool when you're doing some all day smoking.
1238,297,4,The worst part of this is the awful nasty smell.  Do not hang it near your house or if you plan on eating outside put it far far away.  I hung it outside of my garage-I just could not stand the smell. I went and checked it several times every hour or so to see how it was doing and it was doing great.  I had several dozen flys/bugs in it after just a few hours.Great smelling if you are a fly!  Lol
1121,821,4,"UPDATE: It caught a mouse! Had to have been a clean kill. I disposed of it outside easily without having to touch the mouse. I'm upping the stars by one because the design does actually work. You just have to be careful when setting it not to breathe on it...I really like the design of this trap in theory, the way you can place it against the wall, the fact that you can wash it and reuse it, and also that it won't ""bite"" human fingers if they are stuck in the trap. However, I had immediate problems with the trap. Once set, it seems to spring open all by itself. After the first night, I found one of the traps sprung open but the trap itself had not moved. I thought ""Oh! Crafty mouse!"" But then, when I tried to reset it, it kept popping open and the three trap ""lids"" wouldn't stay closed. I finally got it set, and then while I was standing there looking at it from above, one of the traps popped open again. Am I doing something wrong here?I know we have mice because I see the droppings, but I've never seen them in action. I don't know what size they are, but I expect they are field mice because I've seen a dead one outside. Tiny mice, so they ought to be killed by this trap. But note that the instructions say, ""For only a couple of mice, a dozen traps are not too many."" Are you kidding me? At ten bucks a trap, I think I'd rather just live with the mice or poison them and put up with the smell of them dying in the walls. Even if they are considering one trap as three, that's still a lot of money compared to the cheaper alternatives."

1120,338,4,"Having had a large oak taken down and left with a large pile of 17 - 20"" pieces to chop, I figured a new splitting wedge would make life easier. My old wedge is of similar shape and design but with a blunter tip. For me the new wedge works no better than the old one. Not to say it doesn't work, but that I didn't need to buy a new one.This new wedge is more prone to pop out of the log than the older one and takes quite a bit of effort to drive into the wood with my maul. On one log section, I eventually gave up and attacked the piece with my new Fiskars X27 axe by slicing around the perimeter. As the diameter of the log shrunk, I was able to finally drive in the wedge and crack the remainder of the wood section in half.I have found that putting the wedge in the center of a log section, even one with a crack, doesn't work as well as off-centering the wedge. On less challenging sections of wood, I was able to drive the splitter much more easily and often separate the wood into three pieces.And so this wedge  works fairly well within limits; it's just not the heroic, wonder tool I was hoping for.UPDATE - After more use and experimentation I've found that my much older Oregon splitter is easier to drive, doesn't fly out at me, and works faster. This new splitter has quickly been relegated to reserve status."
0,198,5,Best leaf rake I ever owned. The 5ft lightweight aluminum handle is perfect for us &#34;mature&#34;  individuals who prefer things easy to use. The rake part adds another foot to the length and is two feet wide at the very tip end. The plastic rake part is attached to the aluminum pole with a single screw. That makes it a simple task if the rake part needs replacing. This garden tool makes raking almost a pleasure.Prime members can have this delivered to your door for just under 16 bucks. That is one heck of a deal for such a fine rake. This is a winner.
962,669,3,"I found these for like five bucks at Marshall's the day after I ordered these!  Anyhow, they are a nice set of scissors and have a heavy duty feel to them.  I like how you can easily take the scissors apart for cleaning, or using the blade as a knife.  It's a really handy pair of scissors, as it has all these other functions built-in, like a bottle opener.  I have a pair of Tradesman scissors which are even more heavy-duty, but this is a good pair to keep around to use in the kitchen, or even the garden."
1519,313,5,"This plant has been both more cold resistant and more pest resistant than the two dwarf cavendish banana plants growing in the same microclimate.  I bought the two cavendish plants at Home Depot with about eight leaves and about two feet high a week or two after I got this tiny nanner with four itsy bitsy leaves on it and they are all about the same size now.  We had two near-frosts that took a toll on the two others, but this plant never blinked at the cool weather.  So far so good.  It is now about three feet tall with no brown spots or blemishes of any kind, and no pest problems.  By comparison, the two dwarf cavendish plants always have at least a few leaves with brown spots on them no matter how often I care for them.  No fruit from any of them yet, but all things in their time. :)"
772,407,4,"I use this all the time for scooping mulch, compost & dirt. It is sturdy and rust free but I'd like it better if the scoop part was wider / bigger."
1496,527,5,"I've got three other feeders, one being very similar to this, but having a green glass bottle.  I use a solution of one part sugar to four parts boiled and cooled water and the hummingbirds prefer this feeder to the other ones I have.  I think it may be because this one has much more red color than the other three.  It's really easy to clean; the bottom part comes apart into two pieces so you can scrub the inside well and I use a toothbrush on the flowers.  The bottle stays clean with just a rinse every couple of days.  Sometimes I had a little salt and hot water and give it a good shake and rinse well.  If you let it go for a few days, you may need a bottle brush to clean the inside."
1308,92,4,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired, but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence, and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong, and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason, my set came with four extra metal brackets, and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets, which are metal, like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them, unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
847,939,4,This is a good feeder.  Like that it is glass and easy to fill and clean.I give it 4 stars for looks and functionality.I still prefer my Aspects Hummzinger feeders and the hummers like them better also.
358,933,5,"We get lots of hummingbirds here in NW Indiana thru the summer and truly enjoy watching them from our deck or our picture window depending on which feeder is busy.  The biggest problem we have always had is ants getting inside the feeder.  I have no idea if the hummers care, but it sure makes the glass look ugly and dirty.This feeder comes with what they term an ant moat that is supposed to keep them out.  It is simply a shallow dish at the top of the unit that you fill with water.  That will work well if you keep it full, but it does only hold a few ounces of water.  Any improvement is needed and welcome.These feeders always come with &#34;nectar mix&#34; and if you buy it, it is fairly expensive.  All it is is sugar and you can make your own by mixing sugar and water using parts water to one part sugar...being sure to boil the water to kill any microorganisms and not make our tiny friends ill."
168,958,2,"Original review: It's going to take at least a season outside to see how this cover performs, but, so far it'll do the trick. It's a lot lighter than my last cover, but that one was getting new rip after new rip, despite it's heft just by being on a sharp corner. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCNEWM/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1This Budge Industries grill cover fits my grill nicely and is easy to maneuver for me(a 5'3+ woman), it just seems like it could be too lightweight to really protect the grill from the elements. Only time will tell!UPDATE: This cover caught under the wheel just moving it to the side to reach something and ripped before I even knew it was stuck. Disappointing since it was an easier cover to remove and put on, but with this fabric type, I'm not surprised it tore so easily."
402,922,5,"I used to be a professional landscape designer and I know that if garden work is not easy, many people won't do it. When you have to drag out a can and measure and mix plant food, or struggle with putting a container on the end of a hose, sometimes the plants won't get fed in the proper time period. This food is easy! Flip the lid, shake and water in. One application lasts up to three months, if there is not too much rain to leach it out of the soil or pots. Nine percent Nitrogen, 18% Phosphate, 9% soluble potash, 20% sulfur. Feeds 135 square feet or 30 rose bushes. Great product for a homeowner with a small garden. Use as directed, do not over apply. We have used Miracle -Gro commercially for years with good results."
1536,739,3,"There were no instructions, but it was apparent how it fit together.  The back is one piece, the seat another, and then the two arms.  The pieces had to be strong-armed to match the screw holes up, and the screw heads get covered by your typical plastic cover that will likely fall off over time.It seems sturdy enough up to a certain weight, though by simply tightening a screw too much you can easily bend the frame, it's not a very thick aluminum.I do like the angle of the back and the depth of the seat.Overall, however, this seems like something you'd pick up at one of the big hardware stores for under a hundred dollars."
837,750,5,"I've used it about 3 times now and it is extremely powerful especially compared to the 18 Volt WORX that recently died after only approximately two and a half years.I don't know what the future holds for it, but thus far is perfect!!"
850,601,4,"now, don't get me wrong, I still use weed killer, but in our back yard, where are dog hangs out a lot, I didn't want nasty chemical sprays going down, so I got this.  it works pretty well and appears to be somewhat durable."

625,763,5,"I finally got tired of my husband repairing our older (in all fairness, nearly 10 yrs old) Black and Decker. The last time I used it, it happened to be trash day. Right after the string was swallowed into the spool--for the last time, it immediately joined the other trash. After reading the reviews here, I decided the odds of getting a ""good"" one of these (no problems with the spool feed) were in my favor. That, at least, seems to be the case. No problems whatsoever with the string/feed mechanism. It's heavy, but I manage. The adjustable grip enables a short 64 year old, non-athletic woman (me) to be able to use it effectively. I find a learning curve with this, but I'm really no expert on using trimmers anyway. In any case, if you need something for the bigger, tougher jobs (we have a light-weight trimmer for small, ""light-weight"" jobs), this seems to be a good choice. I've also used it in the edging position, and I really like that it etches the ground as it trims. Because it has the wheel, the weight is no concern while edging along paver stones and concrete driveway and sidewalk. This tool will be utilized all year long as we never have a time when grass doesn't grow. For the price (at least Amazon's), I doubt you can find anything comparable."
1065,936,4,"When I received this and opened the box I was hit with the most wonderful smell: peat (okay, so maybe I'm weird, but I love the smell of peat).  And that's pretty much what this product is: 85-95% peat (my bag is probably on the high end of that range).  There is also a little perlite, a *very small* amount of chemical fertilizers (.03-.03-.03), and wetting agents to make the peat absorb water easier.  For the people who complained about lots of sticks it's probably coming from the peat - if you buy a bag of peat you generally get a lot of naturally occurring debris.Still, it worked pretty well for me.  The fertilizers are light enough to give a small boost to seedlings without burning them.  I think I might have preferred that it have worm castings added, but that's just my preference.  The peat still took a while to absorb water so the wetting agents are pretty light as well, but it was definitely easier and quicker than plain peat.  And being so heavy on peat, it didn't dry out quickly.  Overall, a nice product for seed-starting or cuttings."
974,878,4,"I'm a fan of the Rat Zapper Ultra, and use it to zap mice in our home.  I already had a Rat Zapper Classic, and found it performed admirably, but was excited about the Ultra because of the extra kills you get from the batteries.  With the Classic I found I'd get a few mice, but then the juice would wear down quickly and I'd hear it go off but then not find anything within.  So, that's not cool.  But, with the Ultra, I don't have to change the batteries as often, and it's still nice and easy to kill & dispose of the critters.  The indicator light is also a nice plus.  Now, to be clear, this isn't perfect - cleaning it can be a pain when it gets, um, messy (mostly from food), and it does still miss some mice, but on the whole, it's better than a lot of other products out there, and is much cleaner / safer than snap traps or glue traps in my opinion.All in all, I like the Rat Trapper Ultra, and expect to use it for a long time to come."
1341,386,5,"Found an old Weber 22.5"" kettle grill that someone was tossing out and decided to take it home to see if she could be brought back to life.  This one had been abused and seen lots of work.  Aside from some cosmetic issues, she was missing the hook on the inside of the lid and the sweeper cleaner was just a rusty mess. The former owner had cut or twisted off the sweeper blades since the unit was frozen with rust.I bought this replacement sweeper knowing I'd fix it and waited for it to arrive before trying to remove the old one.  And, I'm glad I did.  I noted how this assembly goes together fitting into the Weber.  Very simple design using gravity and the sweeper handle at the bottom to hold the entire mechanism in place -  a thumbscrew holds the sweeper handle in place.  Remove the thumbscrew, pull out the sweeper handle and... voila!  The mechanism ""should"" just pop out!Did I mention that this old sweeper was a ball of rust?  Seriously.  It was so rusty that the thumbscrew was almost indistinguishable.I put the kettle upside down on a workbench and gave the mechanism an overnight soak of penetrating oil before working on it.  Just for yucks, I put a vise grip on the thumbscrew which of course promptly broke off.  I then used a hack saw to cut off the sweeper handle flush with the hexagonal ""bolt"" that extends out from the bottom of the grill.  Once the handle was cut away I used a hammer to easily tap the remaining fused mass of rust out of the grill.  This may sound a bit confusing, but really it isn't - reviewing how this thing goes together gave me an insight how to get the old one off.I also ""replaced"" the hook on the inside of the lid and bought a cover for the old gal.  The grill works great and it was fun to keep this from needlessly going to the landfill.My wife and I like to entertain and having a second kettle will be great to have when we need it."
398,188,5,"My yard is like a menagerie of wild animals.  So many birds we can't feed them all, squirrels, ducks, snapping turtles, humming birds but the ones I trap and get rid of are the chipmunks.  They dig everyplace and can do substantial damage if they get out of control.I trap them with this Havahart cage and take them to a very large park about 10 miles away.  I see this as the humane way of taking care of these critters.  I use a slice of apple tied to the trip plate and it works fine and last for several days if they don't come around.  Every once in a while I would catch a baby squirrel and let it go or maybe even a bird.I have used two of these cages and the first one worked flawlessly.  On the second one the trip setting lever was not bent properly out of the box and I had to re-align it to get it to trip easily and not jam partially open.  The second one is definitely more difficult to set.Last spring I caught 6 chipmunks in one day!  This cage is much too small to catch full size squirrels as the door only closes on their tail and will not lock and the squirrels are very strong and able to escape.Funny story, we went to the park to drop off a chipmunk and we always park in the same spot.  Three chipmunks ran up to the truck like they wanted to get in and my wife said that they just wanted a ride home.  Too bad fellows!"
1315,739,3,"I ordered this bench for my garden, I didn't get a bench, but two chairs which is perfectly fine.My complaint with the product is that the packing was dismal at best.  The two chairs were wrapped here and there with a bit of cellophane like product and placed in a box.  No filler, no padding, just two chairs plunked in a box.  When the box arrived it was badly damaged, one of the chair legs was poking out of it.  After opening the box I found one of the slats laying on the bottom of the box, a missing screw, and a missing top piece which is supposed to hold in the slat.The product is not made of anything too special, but it is definitely weather resistant, and washes quite easily.Can't say much for comfort, but since I'm using the chairs for more of a garden decor element that's fine.  I just sit in them to get the kinks out after weeding.If I hadn't gotten these for review I would have been very disappointed and would have immediately returned the chairs, mainly because of the terrible packaging."
108,613,5,This works just fine - bump feed seems reliable and does not overfeed. It is quite powerful and an ideal size for a small patch of lawn.

996,588,5,"I bought this to use on my Trex Deck since I was on my hands and knees scrubbing mold for hours. After using it for the first time this week, here are my initial thoughts:PROS- Easy to set up (from in the box to using it in less than 30 min)- Does a great job on the Trex Deck and rails; doesn't even require me to touch up afterwards- Very portable since it's relatively small and light- Hose and power cord are long- Compared with gas washers, this requires little maintenance and is much quieterCONS- Hose reel is worthless - don't use this!- Accessories holder doesn't do a great job of keeping everything togetherOVERALLI definitely recommend this. The cons are a small hassle but at the end of the day, I can clean what I need quickly and easily. I considered the 1500 PSI handheld model (AR Blue Clean AR118 1,500 PSI 1.5 GPM Hand Carry Electric Pressure Washer) and although I'm sure that would do the job as well, I like having the extra PSI for other things such as cleaning my concrete and house siding."
612,787,4,"This has decent power for a cordless, not great but good. Very lightweight and balanced. Cuts through grass easily and most weeds, even thick ones pretty well too if you take your time and go slow with the thicker weeds.Edging feature works really nice and was a breeze.I did about 30 minutes off trimming and edging and still have two bars left."
1565,854,4,"I bought this after buying a Greenworks mower (WHICH I LOVE!!!) - so was a bit disappointed in that the weight of this trimmer vs my Echo 2 cycle gas trimmer...not less and the balance is not near as good for me, i.e. it is not as comfortable to work with as the Echo.  Thankfully, I don't have a lot of trimming to do and I'm rural so can do a little at a time.BUT...the push button start and no gas/oil mix...it evens out.  I'd still rather go this route but maybe should have gone for the spendier trimmer by Greenworks."
966,849,2,"Yes, I know, it's not politically correct to point out that some squirrels are not quite as bright as others. But facts be facts. And to irate members of the SDL (Squirrel Defense League), I can only say, let nature take its course. The behavior of squirrels is what gives them a bad name, not inherent bias against them. We wouldn't try to keep them out if they weren't so greedy! But they insist on stealing all the other critters' food, even though the squirrels have more than enough for their fat little selves already.One has to wonder if they didn't have an insider on the design team for this very poorly designed bird feeder, because it's really a squirrel feeder. The top has no threads or snap-on feature to lock it down, so the squirrels just climb on top of the feeder and have their way with it. Plus the cheap plastic window is out of keeping with the otherwise solid steel construction. And most birds don't seem to want to use it, as almost all of them prefer the old school wood feeder we have a dozen feet away. The perches on this are small and round, hardly comfy for most of our flighty friends.Still, all they have to do is put some threads or a snap on top. And use some decent plastic for the windows! This stuff is like the plastic on top of folder files. This would only be worth its 28 buck price tag if those two things were rectified.Until then, this feeder is for the squirrels, not the birds."

1336,498,5,We bought the 22.5 WSM in april and tested it. First item we made was Prime rib (2 hours job) then pork ribs (5 hours job). This smoker runs like a machine. We filled the pan with water ignited the charcoals and you forget the smoker. Just wait until ready.Cleaning this week was easy afterwards and the smoker is ready to go again.Consuption of coals is moderade compared to the size. For both jobs we used about 16 pounds of coals only. This is not much compared with the the smoker was running 7 hours in total. We closed all vents after the food was ready and stopped the smoker. Good coals we re-used for the next job.We can warmly recommend this unit for trouble free smoking of food regardless if much or just a little. This smoker is worth every penny.
903,658,4,"I live in NYC and by the time I received these last year, the BBQ was packed away. So I was extremely happy when we got a batch of nice weather, the BBQ urge hit and I didnt have to go out to buy charcoal. These are made from coconut shells but but dont look much different from reg charcoal. They took a while to light but once they got going they stood lit longer. They get very hot, something i didnt expect so make sure you check your food. I liked how they smelled while they were cooking but was dismayed to realize when tasting the food that it didnt have that BBQ flavor I love. No coconut, no hint of anything.  Its the whole reason I use a coal grill so this was a big negative for me. It was like cooking on a gas grill....w/o the gas.  Maybe if I marinade my food w a lil smoke seasoning next time it might add that smoky flavor I'm looking for,  but I think I'll stick to reg charcoal. I really did like how clean they burned so if you are eco concious these are great. The price is a bit much for me as well but if you want better, you pay more."
317,48,5,"Hello. My name is Momster and I am a gadget lover. Oh, I am also lazy...I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler. Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that. But honestly, once you get everything figured out, you'll wonder why in the world you struggled so long without them...especially as you get older....it's no fun playing Twister to get at the spigot."
984,167,4,"The product works very well, just like many of the other reviewers have mentioned. We used to have deer coming to eat our plants and flowers quite often, almost on a daily basis. But with this repellent, we haven't had any issues.The one thing I didn't like was that product wasn't shipped well - the cover had come loose and there was some spillage when I removed the product from the packaging. So beware when opening - the cover may not be closed all the way."
884,701,5,"I think my beach house was built on an ant hill. I have had nummerous problems with all kinds of ants and critters in my house. I put these traps out about 2 weeks ago around the perimeter of my house. At first there was no difference. I would still find the occasioanl stray ant on my countertop or cruising along the carpeting. However, the past few days their appearances have been less and less. I am thinking that the Terro Ant Bait is finally taking effect and killing the little critters one by one...hurrah!! There still seems to be plenty of liquid in each of the 6 baits, so I hope that all ants will have the chance to drink the kool-aid and share it with their friends. The gift that keeps on giving. By the end of the summer I should be completely ant-free. I plan on buying the granular version of this product and spreading it around the house to reinforce the efficacy. I cannot stand to have bugs anywhere near me, and so far, this product has been among the best for keeping me sane."
501,433,4,"The overall design of this bird feeder is very nice. I found it easy to fill, works well with sunflower seeds (my preferred bird feed), and is very attractive. My main concern is the amount of plastic used, especially on high wear points such as the perch. I've never had a plastic bird feeder last for more than 2 years (and usually less than that) due to wear and tear from the rather large squirrel population in the area. I don't mind feeding them since they can be very entertaining to watch, but they do put a lot of wear on the feeders. The only feeders that have lasted for me are ones that are mainly made of metal. More costly up-front, but last much longer.The feeder tube is also plastic which is good for keeping the feeder weight down and ensuring that it won't break should it accidentally hit the ground during re-loads. But the plastic is so thin that I'm very concerned it will not hold up well to the weather, especially the winter. This is a feeder that I'll most likely bring in once the cold weather returns due to concerns about the plastic cracking in very cold weather.I can't give any feedback at the moment as to whether the clear plastic tubes stand up to sunlight without becoming yellowed or cloudy, a common issue with plastic feeders. I'll update this after the feeder has been out in the sun for a few months.I'll give it four stars, although 3.5 is a better assessment. It is attractive, and the ability to offer a drink plus food is a nice feature. At this price point I expect to see a lot of plastic, but I think the main stress points should be made of thicker material than this. Based on many years of using (and discarding) feeders, this seems to be too light-weight to last very long.Recommended, but with some reservations."

This year I forgot this chore and as they have in the past the ants set up shop in the dishwasher.

908,922,5,"With many pots and sections of my yard full of flowering plants, I go through a lot of plant food.Mostly, I rely on organic slow-release fertilizer formulated for the various plants (citrus, flowers, roses, etc.), These come in cardboard boxes and bags, which are more environment-friendly than this bulky plastic bottle.But there are certainly good uses for this product. Many people with container gardens or small patios have no place to store the sometimes-messy boxes and bags of fertilizer.  Plus, more attention needs to be paid when doling out appropriate portions from these bulkier containers. Novice gardeners will probably appreciate the more controlled fashion in which they can dispense the plant food.The contents are standard for promoting healthy blooms.Happy gardening!"
1544,47,5,"I've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand.  I've been through two different mauls, and this my friends, is the best I've used.  It's lighter, but it splits like a maul twice its weight.  I just wanted to try it out when I first got it, so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete.  All I can say is wow, I immediately went inside and ordered the 14"" and 8"" hatchets & fiskars sharpener.  I'm 6'4"" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet. I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design, it does not require the ""windup"" and force of the longer and heavier mauls.  Buy it."

Well, like the old adage, you get what you pay for.First, these are huge. If you happen to be a smaller sized woman then be prepared to simply swim in these things. They tend to be rather sturdy so will not easily conform to the shape of your hand or wrist whatsoever. To give a perspective, my pinky finger literally only goes half way up...the rest just wrinkles and bends backwards. As for dimensions around, I could fit BOTH my wrists into one single glove. Far too large for the average woman.Additionally, as others have pointed out, these are not truly rose gloves and will not provide the type of intensive protection most have come to expect.Given the price, they are still a decent value esp if the size fits. I did decide to keep them and use just for general labor, digging and non-precise labor as they are well built and sturdy."

1599,872,4,"Years ago (decades, actually), there were times I needed something to control the foam in my spa.  This was also the time that people used a mini-chemistry set to check for chlorine or bromine levels, pH, and total alkalinity.My techniques have evolved.  I've learned that water ""feel"", smell, and clarity are all the indicators I need to make adjustments.  And I haven't had a foam issue for, literally, 15 years.  But I recognize that if others use my spa, or if something gets spilled, or whatever, ""da foam"" can return.  So an antifoam product is good to have, just to keep on hand.For this test, I mixed dish detergent with water in a clear, tall glass, and got a good head of foam.  I added 3 drops of Orb-3 T422-000-1PT Pool and Spa Antifoam, and... nothing really happened.  This makes sense, because the agent weakens the bubbles, causing them to collapse, but the agent doesn't defy gravity and travel up the glass.  So my next test was to mix dish detergent with 3 drops of antifoamer, then add water.  What a difference!  First, overall, instead of a glass 3/4 full of foam, there was about an inch of foam.  The water was very opaque, and full of tiny, tiny bubbles that all disappeared in about 30 seconds, leaving behind clear water.  Those tiny bubbles reminded me of the foam in a pint of Guinness, which is not a bad drink when you are in the spa!So this product works against foam.  Remember, however, that foam is an indicator of something out of wack.  The best use of your antifoamer is never having to use it.  And if you do use it, and afterwards there are evil vapors and scum left behind, remember that an antifoamer doesn't remove what you put into the spa, it just breaks down the bubbles.  Consider the source of the organic substances that contribute to foam!"

Sulfur and manganese are among the other ingredients that  are beneficial to tomato plant growth.  So, although this product is labeled &#34;Pansy Food&#34; it contains ingredients that are helpful to other types of plants as well. My tomato plants are thriving after I treated them with this fertilizer.I plant pansy seed in October which is the time to do so  in this neck of the woods.

66,334,3,"I was excited for the Plant Sitter to work, but alas, it must have gotten distracted and focused on playing on its cell phone when it should have been tending to the plant. Alas, so hard to find good sitters these days. :)Really, though, it's a good idea, but just didn't work for us. Maybe it was operator error, but the thing really didn't come with a lot of instructions.We placed in to tend a tomato plant that we had in a pot about 14"" in diameter.As we checked on it, it seemed that the water level in the Plant Sitter container was going down, so it seems like it was watering, but it just wasn't watering enough, and the tomato plant really struggled.This may be the type of Sitter that needs a watchful eye, but then, what's the point?It could be used as a backup for watering if you're prone to forget to water everyone once and a while, but as a main source for watering on a long vacation, I'd think twice about, unless you test it really well before you leave and are confident that it provides enough water for the size of planter you have."
428,241,3,"Today is June 29th and I began this adventure on March 1st, 4 months ago and the production expectancy for this set.  The sprouting was slow, but the CS Rep from AeroGrow suggested I be patient.  He said they would really take off once they sprouted.  Well, they did and we were off to the races.  So far, 1 mini jalapeno and 1 purple super hot have bit the dust completely.  The second mini jalapeno grew huge but never produced a single pepper.  Two of the purple super hots are still alive, but have never even produced a flower either.  Both of the red fires are lush and have produced a total of 10 peppers so far.  Considering the cost of electricity, the kit, the extra nutrients which needed to be purchased because there are not enough included, the replacement light kit, and the hours upon hours of talking to, touching, fertilizing by movement and a tiny hand held fan (CSR's suggestion) These are the most expensive peppers I've ever consumed.  I'm thinking of transplanting these into my garden plot to see if they ever produce.  I have one more seed kit (herbs) which I'm going to give a try and then I'm going to give up on this, and I'm not going to buy another set of bulbs even though it's advised.  If you want alot of leaves which you do not consume, then this is the seed kit for you.  I, on the other hand, wanted something to use in the kitchen."

We bought this on the basis of great reviews and because it, along with the new Weber kettle we bought, cost about 1/2 what the Smokey Mountain smoker would have cost.  We also like the idea of not having to kneel down to tend it.First time, great results.  We ignored the suggestion of giving it a no-food run the first time and put some chicken pieces on, figuring we could always finish them in the oven if we failed with the charcoal.  No problem, the temperature stayed right around 225F.  Second time, our big pork roast took longer than the time we allowed, not the Smokenator's fault.  The Smokenator again performed exactly as the instructions predicted.  We just got hungry too soon.  Finished the meat in the microwave.Yes, we'd buy it again, but we probably won't have to.

1299,553,4,"I have the perfect test for comparing this spray with the typical stuff you find on the shelf at your local Lowe's/Home Depot, etc.I have a gardenia at the back of my house, in a fairly tough area for a gardenia, that is constantly plagued (especially this time of year (Spring) by white flies, disease, leaf drop, you name it.  So I have to almost constantly spray the things down with pesticides and fungicides.So I sprayed one of my suffering gardenias with the ""Less Safe"" brand (Immunox) and the other gardenia with this ""Safer Brand"" to see which would be more effective.  Fortunately, both showed noticeable results in a few days, as there were no white flies in either gardenia, and the black spot was much less prevalent in both, and I think less black spot on the one that was sprayed with this brand.  Both gardenias were so bad (before the first spraying) that a second spraying was necessary after a few days however.Not a huge difference between the results of the two visibly, but I would definitely give the nod to the gardenia that had been sprayed with Safer Brand (i.e. the gardenia sprayed with Safer Brand seemed to respond much better and as a result looked better).  Cannot speak at all to the chemicals (and their relative safety profiles) used in these as I am not in that field at all, so I will have to trust the mfr on that I guess.Overall, good stuff, would definitely recommend, and if it's competitive, price-wise with Immunox, I will definitely buy in the future."
1637,685,5,"There are lots of reviews here but I just have to chime in and add my 2 cents. I purchased 3 of these over two years ago from Amazon. Today is the first time I went around to change the batteries in all of them. You are supposed to do it every year but better late than never? I was surprised to find that the batteries I had first installed and have been running these two years are still 80% full as measured by my fancy battery tester. I changed them anyway. Performing this little maintenance chore reminded me of just how wonderful these devices have been in keeping my lawn healthy all these years and not one of them has broken down or leaked or has eaten batteries.My one small complaint is that they do reduce the effective diameter of your hose by restricting the flow a bit. Too bad they don't make a version that has a larger full-flow valve. It doesn't cut down the flow drastically if you are fortunate enough to have decent water pressure. However, if you have marginal water pressure then adding this timer may not be for you.Having said that, I do like this timer and it does the job for me."
123,904,5,"This review took a bit of time to write due to the need to test the results. I happened to have some hanging baskets in need of a bit of TLC since they were bought on the clearance rack at the local big box store. When this arrived I sprinkled some in, watered diligently for a few weeks and waited to see what would happen. Blooms all the way around! In fact, not only did my somewhat dubious looking hanging baskets of flowers fill out with new leaves and begin to bloom profusely but a few unknown hitch hikers draped down the sides and started to bloom as well. Additionally, I like the green factor of a more 'natural' type fertilizer even though this is only for flowers. Worked well in container/potted plants and resulted in significant leaf restoration as well as blooms."
678,337,5,"First let me say we go through A LOT of hummingbird solution. We drain five 48 ounce feeders a day at our house from Mid March through mid July. We also have two pairs that over-winter - so I always have at least one feeder up.I purchased my first Grand Master feeder from Amazon and,when I went to buy more last week I noticed that Amazon is not selling them because of some complaints - or whatever the verbiage was - so I ordered three more from another online source.I have been thrilled with these feeders. They are easier to fill, much easier to clean (you can get your whole hand in the opening) and I no longer need a bottle brush to clean them, plus I am not having to fill quite as frantically as I was because of the larger size. I was so puzzled by the fact that Amazon was not selling them that I started to think of what people might possibly have to say that wasn't good, and this is what I came up with:Most of us, if we use a larger sized hummingbird feeder, are accustomed to using the 32 ounce model that is a bottle with a narrow opening through which you fill the feeder. I used to use a funnel to do so. The bottle sets in the base. When carried outside in the upright position here is always a little leakage as you carry them out to the feeding station but that seems to happen with all of the hummer feeders that I have ever tried. With the 48 ounce feeder, the bottom is much wider; hence no need for a funnel and the ability to make cleaning easier. When you set the bottle back on the base, because of the larger opening there is more leakage. That's the only thing that I can think people might complain about.I have easily solved this issue  ( and used to to do the same thing with the 32 ounce models) by keeping the bottle upside down (standing on the top) after they are filled and replacing the bottom of the feeder (which I always cleaned at the same time as I refilled)  on the top and walking them outside in an upside down manner. Problem solved.For me, with the amount of food I go through, this feeder is such an improvement that I would never complain or return to the 32 ounce feeder, funnel and bottle brush ever again. I love this feeder, and with a bit of common sense it is no more 'drippy' than the smaller sized bottles."
778,229,3,"I had a problem with my radishes being eaten by Peter Cottontail.  I caught him 2-3 mornings in a row.  I put this out and he's still eating my radishes.  I used more.  I have maybe 6 radishes left.  (I had tried to get a row to go to seed because I wanted the seeds more than the radishes.)  So it was no help at all with Mr. Cottontail.  I've got a trap now, and it hasn't worked either.  Maybe he is just a smart rabbit.BUT my cucumbers are directly behind my radishes, and I let my chickens out once a day and usually they try to go over and nibble my vines and we have to redirect them.  They have not been at all interested in my cucumbers since I put out the Critter Ridder.  It seems to work on chickens.I have a feral cat that gets over there a lot.  I think he's stalking the rabbit.  It has not deterred him.I haven't had trouble with deer there.SO, I think it might or might not work, depending on your critter.  Deer netting is something I've used in the past, and it seems cheaper and more effective.  I ended up potting some of the radishes and moving them into the greenhouse so I could make sure to get my seeds."
1498,19,3,"Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better."

1299,508,1,"Literally the first time I used these shears on a small jasmine vine, one of the rivets that holds the blades together, popped out, never to be found again in the mess that is my mix of tall grass and mulch.  I tried to repair them, but noting I didn't have the right sized nuts and bolts, decided this was not one of those instances where I will just shrug off an inferior product, that I end up fixing myself (especially after the FIRST use!).So I sent a pic into Fiskars (online return/warranty system is very nice and easy FWIW), showing the problem.  I received no feedback for weeks (by this time, my jasmine vine was out of control of course), then one day received a box with a set of their lowest quality shears inside.  Not extendable, and they look like the cheapest shears I have ever seen.  I doubt they will last a season, with the obviously cheap plastic they used for the handles.Talk about a slap in the face.  My time is worth more than dealing with that kind of stuff, and I wish they would just lower their prices and forego the ""lifetime warranty!"" deal if that is how they roll.  I would never have purchased the shears they sent me, so basically I should have just bought another set (NOT Fiskars obviously) of shears when the originals broke.  Ah well, you live you learn.  Buyer beware on these, I see at least three other instances of this same problem happening in these reviews.UPDATE: To be fair, and as a credit to the company's customer service, I actually did contact them later to let them know that I wasn't happy about the switcheroo.  They promptly sent a replacement for the exact shears I originally bought.  Kudos for that!  Hopefully this pair will not fall apart when I start to use them."
1124,398,5,"I ordered the Q320 after exhaustive research and reading comments from owners, both at Amazon, HD, Lowe's etc.  Like others, I have had my share of the cheaper grills,  ones that rusted out, and frustrated us beyond believe at times.  The Webber  box showed up, weighing in at 84+ lbs.  One thing for sure, this thing is packed to prevent any damage; I have ordered generators that were not packed nearly as well.  After unpacking, laying everything out, the job begins.  I have to say the Webber Assembly Info is really poor - to say the least!  Follow the pictures, there is little written instruction....and pay close attention.  It took me about an hour to assemble.  I fired it up and it was super in every way.  We had ordered the Worthington 20lb tank, and the Webber brushes, scrapper, tongs, etc.  I cannot express my satisfaction enough to Webber for such a great product.  This will be the last grill I will ever need....thank you Webber."
217,268,5,"I bought this for my Weber Genesis Silver.  It fit perfectly over the grill.  Two things I really liked about this cover.  First, there were no vents like my old Weber cover.  Basically the vents defeated the purpose of a cover.  Dust would get in - especially during our dust storms out here in AZ.  Second, it's heavy and has an internal liner.  This keeps the bottom of the grill from flapping up and getting dust in that way.This is even cheaper than the Weber cover."

It is nice that the product does come with four AA batteries, a loss leader for main feature, the foil wrapped mosquito repellant.I do wish there was a way to close the Cutter mosquito repellant between uses, as I am afraid the product will leak out more quickly than it is needed, and I find this to be the only real design flaw for the consumer. Otherwise, this product is attractive and works as promised."
823,205,5,"I am very pleased with this flag. I live in an area where it is very warm in summer, sometimes close to 120 degrees. The other monthscan be real windy, so this flag takes a beating. The first one lasted about 18 months out in the weather day and night. It was still verycolorful and had not lost any of its color but one seam started to tear so I took it down and replaced with another of the same kind."
1193,223,5,"I have bought these from other sellers. Bad experience with other sellers. But not this one!!!!!Tips: If they take longer than 1 minute to absorb water. They are old stock. Happened with other seller.Some are bad stock with Fungus Gnat eggs mixed in while processing the pellets. YUCK Gnat larvae eating my seeds. Then they turn into Fungus gnat flies. Yuck yuck!  Not this seller!So basically, I in the future have learned my lesson and will remain loyal to this seller.No I am not making this up. You can see my other reviews on the bad ones."
1208,715,5,"This &#34;Motomco 22310 Tomcat Tier 1 Disposable Bait Station&#34; is used to attract and poison mice, sending them out of the house to die. I should note that we do not have these where children or pets are a concern, so they work well for my needs (your requirements may be different).We can see that critters have been nibbling at the bait in the units we set in our shop, home, and detached garage.Highly Recommended, with the caveats above.CFH"

251,0,4,"Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach."
1202,214,5,"I've used this to spray a lot of shrubs and trees.  It's a good size.  If it were bigger, it would be heavier than I'd like.I found that when this tank is completely full, one can't pump much pressure since there's nowhere for the air to go.  As it the level goes down, it gets easy to pump enough pressure into it.I like the spray handle.  It seems perfect for something this size.  I appreciate the low price at the time of my purchase."
1320,754,5,"I'm not sure what glorious benefits were promised to the fortunate soul who could ""build a better mousetrap"", but whatever it is, the inventor of Nooski's mouse trap is certainly deserving.  It's been done, ladies and gentlemen.  I present to you:  The Better Mousetrap.The concept is simple:  Place a high-tension rubber band around a circular opening.  Place bait just past circular opening.  Hair trigger above bait causes rubber band to deploy around mouse's neck.  Dead mouse.Since our house is such a warm, inviting place, I've had to experiment with a number of different mouse trap designs:  Trap-door style traps, no-see-um spin-style traps, and many different snap traps.  (I won't do glue traps as it seems just way too cruel.)  I like this design for a number of reasons:1)  No more snapped fingers.  With the rubber band providing most of the force, you'd have to actually stick your finger into the trap hole while loading it (a completely unnecessary maneuver) for it to fire on you.  I did have a rubber band zip past my left ear on my first load attempt, but no misfires since.2)  It's as humane a trap as I've found.  If death isn't instantaneous, it's pretty darn close.  About half the mice are still inside the trap when I find them and the rest have been less than 3"" away.  Since the rubber band can only deploy around the mouse's neck, you won't have the issue of a mouse suffering because of a trapped limp.3)  No empty trap.  Out of nearly 10 deployments, I've yet to find my bait missing with a still-loaded trap.  I've seen mice somehow eat the bait off snap and spin traps before.  Not so here.4)  Easy clean up.  If a mouse dies inside the trap, you simply pick up the trap by the pointy end and dump the mouse into whatever receptacle you have waiting.5)  Reusable.  Though one could argue that snap traps are reusable, there's no way I'm going to unload one -- I toss 'em, mouse attached.  Here, the only loss is a rubber band.I WILL be buying more of these when my rubber bands run out (which sadly, will be soon).  Three cheers to Nooski for the simple, yet innovative design that led to a better mousetrap.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
672,774,5,"I got this to replace another brand corded mower that has seen better days.This one is much lighter and more manageable. the previous one was a bit larger.since I have a relative small yard, this size is perfect for me. A &#34;TEST&#34; run shows that it fits my small yard needs perfectly. during the test, I changed the height of the mower several times to see the difference and it was a clean and even cut at all hights.The folding handle is great and allows me to put in in my storage shed and fold it up. The only thing to watch for when doing this is that the electrical cord connection needs to be moved to the outside so as to not pinch it in the folding process.both the mulch and bagging process work with no flaws. (previous old mower lost &#34;power&#34; to bag effectively)a price check of several home improvement stores shows that a similar product is a bit more expensive that the one on Amazon. And with prime free shipping, well, to me thats a bargan!power up and groom that lawn!"
1405,143,3,These were not as sharp as I had hoped.  They are better for indoor pruning or light outdoor pruning.
585,957,5,"This is a pretty cool set.  The vendor sent me a set of these skewers and mats to evaluate and review.  I loved them so much that I bought a second set so I'd have four of the skewers.First I have to confess that I haven't used the mats yet.  I haven't quite found the right use for them, plus I keep my grill pretty hot and these are only for use up to 500 degrees.  The skewers though, oh the skewers...I made a nice big set of kebabs for my family and quickly realized that I can't recall the last time I made kebabs.  Why not?  Because I've always had such horrible luck with them.  I have such a hard time turning the kebabs without just having the chunks of stuff twirl around on the skewers.  So the food cooks unevenly and a lot of the pieces even fall off.  That's no good at all.  But these skewers loop around on themselves to make a complete ring, which means that it's very simple to turn them over:  just grab the pointy end with your tongs and gently turn the whole business over (use a spatula to support the other end if you're worried about being too rough with them).These wire skewers are nice and long.  Each one is the equivalent of two or two and a half of the regular wooden skewers that we typically use.  So each one makes a perfect serving for one family member.I had a few fears with these loopy skewers:1) They'd be too hot to handle.2) They'd be too tough to clean.3) They'd be too unwieldy to store.I used tongs and a spatula to take everything off the grill.  Then I figured I'd need my heavy duty BBQ mitt to hold one end while I wrestled the kebabs off the lines, but by the time I got them into the kitchen and got down to business they had already cooled off.  Awesome!Then when it was time to do dishes I just soaped them up and used a sponge to scrub them.  They cleaned right up!When I was all done, I just coiled them up on themselves and they made a bundle about 6"" in diameter.  They fit in my BBQ cupboard just fine.Like I mentioned before, I got a set of these for free to evaluate, but I loved them so much that I bought another set so I'd have four for my family.  Adios wooden sticks!"
565,685,5,Very easy to set up all the option you just turn the dial and use the plus and minus buttons. The battery has lasted 6 months so far.

1442,553,3,"NOT THE PRODUCT FOR MEI am a weekend gardener, who doesn't know the difference between a pansy and a petunia.  I plant, I water, I fertilize, and I hope for the best.  Occasionally I even spray for bugs.  I was excited when I saw the bottle of Safer 3 in 1 Garden Spray because it is an organic product that claims to be not only an insecticide, but also a fungicide and a miticide.  However, after reading the instructions, I doubted whether this was the right product for me.  My first concern came when I read the label, which clearly stated that the product is ""gentle on most plants.""  Most plants?  That caused me to dig a little deeper.  The instructions state that 3 in 1 Garden Spray is not to be used on about twenty different plants, most of which I don't know if I have in my garden or not.  Then I read that the product is to be applied once a week.  Once a week?  My guess is that it will require at least two 32-ounce bottles to complete one application to my medium-sized garden.  At $12.50 per bottle, that's $25 per week.  Holy crapinoly.  That's when I realized that this is definitely not the product for me."

347,160,1,"Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.  The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the ""general questions"" section was closed, their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time.  I can't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase."

250,589,5,I have a relatively small yard for mowing and this is great! I will probably buy another one of these for my commercial property. NO GAS!!! It gets the job done as well as my expensive gas mowers and is simple to use. I like that it folds down to occupy less space as well. I definitely recommend buying this.
1635,731,4,"I love pressure cookers and have used them in cooking for about 40 years; I also formerly demonstrated several different brands in department and specialty cookware shops, so I was very eager to give the Emson pressure smoker a trial run.  In the hot smoke function, which cooks and smokes food at the same time - probably the most-used function - simply put a few smoking chips into a cup, cover the cup, pour in 1/2 cup water, layer the seasoned food onto the stacking racks, seal the cooker, set the time, and press ""Start.""  It really is that simple.  So far, I've cooked pork tenderloin, chicken drumsticks, and, using the cold smoke function, a salmon fillet. To my knowledge, this is the only stovetop appliance that will cold smoke food.  All the results were perfectly satisfactory.  This could be fun, so my next projects will be smoked hardboiled eggs, and smoked cheese.Details:  I didn't have any chips, so I've used the finely chopped wood chips I purchased for a Cameron stovetop smoker.  These worked fine, using about 1 tablespoon each time.  I followed the suggested times in the instruction booklet, except for the salmon.  I wanted smoked, lightly cooked salmon to place on a salad platter, and the instructed time would have produced a flakey fish suitable for mixing into pates.Reality checks:  While the pressure smoker does smoke food much faster than traditional outdoor smoking, the process is not nearly as fast as pressure cooking in a traditional pressure cooker.  The Emson instructions say to cook chicken pieces for 30 minutes, which produced a slightly overcooked, but tasty dinner.  A traditional pressure cooker takes ten minutes to cook chicken parts.  It may be possible to match the faster results by a traditional cooking method in the Emson smoker, omitting the chips, but the residual smoke odor would discourage me from cooking any recipe other than smoked food.More reality:  The capacity of the cooker is limited to approximately the amount of food for three or four people even with the layering of the racks.  But, the process is quick, so one could repeat the process for a bigger crowd.  The smoke odor fills the room; it remained for over a day, even though I am able to leave a door open to outside and ran the kitchen exhaust fan directly above the cooker while I was using it.  I washed the cooker and am storing it in the garage, but I still smell the smoke when I pass it, several days later.  The safety instructions do not spell out clearly enough the risk of burning oneself.  The user must pull off the pressure regulator to release the steam.  This sends steam shooting out.  I tried it first with a thick hot pad to protect my hand and quickly pulled back as the pad became saturated with steam.  I used a silicone mitt to remove the regulator with good results.  I still came away with my hair and clothes smelling like smoke.All in all, it's a well-made product that delivers as promised."
1206,214,5,Got this is last week have already used it for a few different things and it works just fine! Also a great deal cheaper on here compared to other retail stores so I'm definitely a very happy camper.Would buy again and definitely recommend!
396,854,5,"I am a middle aged mom/grandmother with about an acre yard to cut, mow and trim myself.  I was very impressed with this trimmer.  I've tried gas trimmers, electric weed trimmers and a small battery powered trimmer,Earthwise CST00012 18-Volt 12-Inch Cordless String Trimmer, prior to trying this unit.  I didn't like dealing with cords or mixing gas and oil and theEarthwise CST00012 18-Volt 12-Inch Cordless String Trimmerhad absolutely no power at all and died after hitting the first blade of grass!  That was not a problem with this Greenworks trimmer.The instructions for assembling this unit are about as clear as mud.  Eyeballing the picture on the box along with a lot of trial and error helped me get this thing together.  I placed the battery on the charger and within a couple of hours it was ready to use although it did take a while to try and figure out how to get the head of the trimmer in the direction I needed.I was in love with this unit from the first time I used it.  I used the trimmer around my house, mailbox, culverts at my driveway, and a drainage ditch that can't be accessed with my mower.  I was able to finish the entire yard with one charge.  It took a little over one hour and the cutting power was just as strong when I finished as it was when I began cutting.  I removed the battery and placed back on the charger and the recharge was complete in about an hours time.The only drawback for me it the unit is very heavy.  My arms were aching and jittery after use but that is the tradeoff for not having to deal with extension cords or gas and oil mixes, well worth it in my opinion."
272,323,5,Miracle-Gro has always been good and I got this because of the price and convenience. All one has to do is put one of the packets the box contains  into the Miracle-Gro Sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder) and one can feed the lilacs and everything else in sight in a relatively short time.
2,854,4,"I bought a 3 acre property that needed TLC. I like green products and do not own any gas-powered lawn tools. In choosing a weeder, I looked at B&D but I'd already purchased the Greenworks GMAX mower that uses the same GMAX batteres so I went with this one. This rechargeable electric tool only took a few minutes to assemble and was easy to maneuver (i'm a small woman),  I was pleasantly surprised at the power and battery life of this unit. I was able to cut through huge swatches of 3-4 foot weeds and  unkempt grass easily in preparation for mowing with my new GMAX mower (which by the way is uber-cool). It was fun!  I also really like that I can buy attachments from Ryobi or other brands normally made for gas tools but use them with my LiOn powered trimmer. The only minus was that the string stopped working about 1 1/2 batteries into the job and i had to fix it. But I can't imagine ever using anything that isn't rechargeable so if this is all I can complain about, I am ok with it! i am so impressed that I've decided to get other GMAX tools like the hedge trimmer."
1088,230,5,This is a wonderful shovel.  What I liked best about it is it has a step built on it so you can step down and dig into the dirt easily.  Worked great for pulling up big potted plants in my backyard.  Built very heavy duty
44,655,2,"Note: One of the 2 traps broke without catching a mouse and there have been many misses, but the other trap in the 2 pack finally did catch one, so I'll upgrade from 1 stars to 2 stars.  Still not thrilled with these seemingly cheaply made mousetraps, however.  My original review follows.Based on my experience, this device is more of a mouse feeding tray than a mousetrap.  It's been used for over 2 weeks, as of this writing, and it has not captured a mouse.The food/bait has been partially or entirely eaten at least 5 times but the trap has not managed to kill the hungry critters.  I am assuming that mice absolutely love this device, because it is a terrific source of cheese and peanut butter, available on demand, with little apparent risk of injury to the mouse.The trap snapped shut on my finger and it didn't hurt a bit.  Perhaps the is the reason that it's not catching any mice.The trap was triggered 4 or 5 times, but still no mouse.  There were a number of times where the trap was moved around by the mice but didn't even trigger.  Based on the fact that in my experience it did not catch a mouse, I can't see how it should be rated higher than 1 star.This trap is very lightweight and seems cheaply made and poorly constructed.  As metioned, the spring tension seems minimal and is apparently not up to the task.  From my perspective, this mousetrap is useless.I will continue to evaulate this trap and if results improve then I will update my review and increase the rating accordingly.  But a mousetrap than can't catch mice isn't going to do you a whole lot of good.Don't waste your money on this one.  Buy a bigger and better mousetrap.  Specifically, I would recommend the Ortho 0321210 Home Defense Max Secure-Kill Rat Trap - 1 Pack which I have also reviewed here at Amazon.  This trap is larger, features far better construction and has a spring offering a much higher level of tension.  You would not want to get your finger caught in the Ortho 0321210 trap and I have given that mousetrap a 5 star rating.I've seen some favorable reviews here, but I can't share their positive feelings about this product.  It is not recommended."
1428,146,2,"To call this &#34;spill proof&#34; is ridiculous! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine. Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout, thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister, and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work. I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead. If I can find a replacement cap at least I won't have completely wasted 20 bucks. Not recommendedPros: will hold 5 gallons, does have 2 handles, is fairly stableCons: the nozzle is a waste of time, there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place"
1088,764,5,I have used the blower portion of this devise to clear my side walk of grass and leaves.  I has enough power to easily do that.  It really is not that loud plus holds it charge for a long period of time.  I would recommend this over gas or plug in version.
610,420,5,I bought two of these to fend off the multitude of squirrels that attack our feeders and empty the seed overnight. They seem to be doing the job so far. I hope they continue to work. I will update should it changes. Great product so far.
430,912,4,"I have been a weber customer for many years now. I tried other cheaper brands like Char-broil and Char-king, other similar cheap models and have always regretted it. Burners crack and break, the housing rusts through, etc.I have had an older model of the weber Q grill for the past 3 years, it has sat on my deck with a weber cover over it and yes looks great still.I actually got two different weber grills, both reviews are below.--------So now the review for this smaller portable version of the grill. It is made very similar to the larger model except it's about 1/3 the size. The lid is constructed out of the same material, the grates are heavy duty and everything about this grill is just smaller then the larger model.The build quality is excellent. When taking the portable grill out of the box its nearly assembled. All I had to do was put the lid on and attach the handle. Then you slide the grease tray in the bottom, attach your propane and you are ready to go.The grill lights very easily with the built in igniter. Simply turn the gas on, push the igniter button and flame. It cooks evenly and distributes heat well. What I don't like about this small grill is the lack of a thermometer. In the larger ""Q"" grill it includes a thermometer in the lid, this small portable one has lost that feature.All in all it's a great grill, it is built very well, nearly assembled when it arrives, very portable and looks great.  I would recommend this grill if you are looking for a portable one. This grill would get 4 stars.-------The larger model grill with the stand arrived packaged very well and had zero damage. Assembly was fairly easy, however one of the screws refused to go in, it got stock and stripped pretty bad. I saw another reviewer with similar issues so I have to question the quality control of the build.Now, even with one screw not in the grill still sits on the stand pretty solid thanks to the 11 other screws used to hold it together. The stand was ""easy"" to put together, although it sure would have been nice if they had labeled the parts or had you know... words in the directions. I actually installed parts of the stand backwards and didn't realize until after I had it nearly done. The directions are mainly just pictures so I got confused. A little sticker like ""A"" or ""Front"" to help indicate what part is what would be awesome.Now once the stand is assembled the grill pops on easily, you screw it in, attach the lid, the temp gauge and the handle/light and you are ready to cook. The grates are heavy duty, the grill is able to be moved with little trouble and I love it. My old ""Q"" grill similar to this said ""WEBER"" along the top on the lid. This grill is nearly identical but instead of ""WEBER"" it now has the ""Q"" logo printed in the metal.Overall I love this grill, I wish assembly was a bit more clear, but it was easy to resolve my issues.  If you are looking for a outdoor grill the larger model with the stand and collapsible tables is an awesome one, like I said I had an older model on my patio with the basic weber cover over it for years and it still works perfect."
613,777,3,"This oughta be a nice thing.  The idea is good and more than good.  I sit in the migration lanes for more kinds of birds than you can swing a cat at.Big boids, dozens o' little gold finches and everything.  Even escaped convicts from the Parrot Penitentiary Plenary Aviary over on Seventh Street.  Every time there is a jail break, they come on the lamb.  Which I also serve to them, mostly fat and grizzle.But they do not play nice.  Crack corn and all.So I figure this tower is my best bet to keep them apart for the small seed and the big feed. Yes, the feeder is attractive..But I hoped for practical function.My hopes are dashed as the aves eat everything scattering what they don't want to the ground. I find this is too much a bother to maintain.  Just a speck of non Chinese engineering might have done it between the upper and lower chambers so the feed does not come crashing down.  But that would have reduced the profit by a quarter, I guess.Having your birds feed by size is a good idea.  Using flimsy  material in a weakly engineered body is only marginal. I gave a third star because you can be careful and happy."
638,878,5,"Killing mice is always gross, but we get them under our kitchen cabinet (who knows how they come in) every year. This is about the size of a shoe box and works on batteries with little 'dead mouse contact'. Still takes a while to catch them, but works well."
219,754,2,"Interesting concept, design and execution on this ""Nooski 300000798 Mouse Trap With 10 Rings.""Once one gets the hang of setting trap, it does work, but we have to give this one an overall ""thumbs down"" because the very premise...death by strangulation...is a faulty one. Why?1) It's less humane than an instant death by broken neck (and while the cheaper-by-the-dozen wooden-spring traps may lead to some ""poorly-executed"" executions, there are some very good, strong traps available that can be counted on to provide a much more humane kill (for example, theSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness).2) Some mice (like the last one we caught) can endure more than others, and can travel to other locations before they actually succumb...not fair to the mouse, and a ticking time bomb of stinking death to the homeowner.3) Even if the user is OK with this asphyxiation method...there is the need to buy more razor blades (errr...nooses)...while a spring trap just keeps on giving (or taking away...depending on your perspective).The only practical uses for this system would be either outdoors (and why go after mice outdoors...that's where they belong)...or in an enclosed area like a drawer that they can squeeze into when they are healthy (but that's entrapment)...and still, the death may be painfully slow.This is one of those products that someone thought about too much, in our humble estimation. Better than a glue trap (but those should be against the law anyway...they are dangerous to crawling babies & small pets). Spring traps (well-built) are better. And a cat is even better...adopt one today and solve your problems and provide a home at the same time ;-)"
568,229,4,"I've tried using assorted repellents like this for a while, always with mixed success. It's mixed enough for me to somewhat suspect more of a placebo effect--I want it to work so I think I notice more effect than it has.However, that being the case, there is enough of a indicator it has an influence in keeping away pests. But, I've found that if I try to use this as a complete solution, I'm both disappointed and quickly run out.  For me it works best with more of a targeted approach, using it where I particularly don't want pests to be or to go through--gaps in fences, openings between brush.  I have to be careful because I likewise don't want to use this where I or my family want to be.Mostly, I find it's helpful to keep our yard a relatively unfriendly place--so that we don't get overrun.  I've noticed a decrease in critter activity, so for that I keep using it."
1639,832,3,"32 ounce Deer/Rabbit RepellentI use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using a deer/rabbit repellent.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so I've seen the footage of the deer going to the bushes & walking away.  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain &#34;resistant&#34; & it did last through a couple rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it  although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 30-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You also need to reapply to any new growth because it will not have the nasty flavor on it to deter the deer/rabbits from snacking.It does have an odor until it dries but it is less noticeable than similar products I've used.  It's not very offensive; just a cinnamon/clove scent with the rotten eggs/vinegar.This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering  the ingredients are not unusual.  Using this with a hose is also kind of messy & maybe more wasteful than other products that don't require a hose.  I think the &#34;concentrate&#34; form would be a better choice.  However, if you use the concentrate, you need to run fresh water through the sprayer after using it or you will get clogs from the &#34;rain resistant&#34; ingredients.  So both versions have their problems."

1144,820,5,This was easy to assemble and it looks like a great product. It is assembled by screwing in a three inch bolt that holds the legs together to form a base. The top ring on the wire mesh simple screws into the metal at the top. I had the whole thing unpacked and assembled in ten minutes. It has several holes in the bottom basin and the instructions say to add several inches of sand. But obviously the sand would run out. Instead it seem like it would be best if you added gravel about the size of your fingernail. I have no idea why the manufacturer suggested adding sand. It has been too cold to barbecue here so I will give an update how it works with a fire as soon as the weather warms up.
1043,669,5,"Chances are that you are aware of, maybe even familiar with any number of multiple purpose tools based upon a pocket knife (Wenger Swiss Army Knife) or a pair of pliers (Leatherman Multi Purpose Tool), but have you ever seen one based upon a pair scissors?Me neither.Of course, the mere fact that you've bundled a bunch of tools into one package means nothing.  The question is, ""Do they work?""With a single exception, yes.  That exception is the Tape Cutter on the plastic Blade Sheath, which cannot cut through more than a single layer of packing tape.  If you must regularly open packages sealed by the careful (or the paranoid!), you will have to use some sort of knife blade, leaving a useless but sharp-enough-to-hurt plastic projection on the blade sheath with which you can accidentally stab yourself.As for the basic function of the scissors themselves, it is excellent overall.  The ergonomics I found slightly inferior to that of the single purposeScotch Precision Ultra Edge Non-Stick Scissor, 8-Inch, Brown with Assorted Accent Colors (Dot Color Will Vary) (1468TUNS-MIX)but not by much.The Scotch scissors stay on my desk.  The Fiskars Multi-Purpose Scissors stay in my car."
562,380,5,Perfect for indirect or direct grilling.  You cannot go wrong with the purchase and works like a charm.  Weber makes some really good stuff!
152,261,5,If you shop around you will see that with prime this price is hard to beat.  I like using mesquite while smoking and when I want a little more tang in the smoke flavor.
1217,91,5,This kit is a great value and super easy to use. I love that they include a little packet of info on suggested Ph values for certain plants and veggies. Awesome!!!
1252,106,5,"I had purchased a different yard combo about 2 month before and they where a piece af junk.  All the stuff ran for about 1 minute and then started running out of power.  The hedgers broke and I couldnt get them replaced.I wanted a set of these yard tools so I bought the Black and Decker set.  Yes the set was about 80.00 more and had less voltage but I was deturmined to get a cordless yard set.  When I received them the first thing I noticed was the construction was a lot better.  I charges them up over night and used the handy storage rack.  In the morning I got out the hedgers and trimmed up all my hedges on 1 battery then used the same battery and used the trimmer and then the blower all on the same battery.  WOW  The trimmers had more power then I expected, same with the blower.  I am very pleased with this set.  I recommend this set to anyone who is in the market for a cordless yard combo."
237,241,5,"So far, I've grown lettuce and gourmet herbs in the Aerogarden. The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up."
1415,697,5,"This plant stand is very attractive and sturdy!  It is solid enough to hold even heavy ceramic, pottery or concrete pots. I got this to use outdoors but it is so nice that I am currently using it indoors.  Definitely a good buy and highly recommended."
652,251,5,"If you are looking for a non-chemical way of dealing with bugs, Diatomaceous Earth ( or DE) is an easy way to kill them without harming anyone in your family or your pets. To your touch, DE feels like coarse sand, but to insects and slugs, it is like crawling thru broken glass. It will cut them and lead to dehydration and death.Since there are no chemical components, there is nothing for the insects to adapt to. And with no liquid component, you can puff it around electrical outlets without fear of shorting anything out. In fact DE works better in cracks and narrow access points because the insects will have to force their way thru it.DE is also great for your garden as you can use it on your crops without risk to you or your family. Puff it around the base of your tomatoes to stop cutworms and if you have slugs, fill a saucer with beer and surround it with DE. You will get them coming and going."
1068,3,4,"There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair."
1169,215,2,"It does work and works great when it works, but having to stop and unstick the line from itself is a pain you know where.

1255,534,2,I wasn't aware it only held niger seed.  None of the birds that come to my feeders eat niger including the American Goldfinches. The other problem was for it to work the squirrels had to come from the top.  Mine all come from below.
309,612,3,The Karcher Window Vac is great if you are cleaning windows that are not so dirty or Bathroom Tile or Tubs you want to keep dry.. This Vac just picks up the excess water left behind by cleaning. I really dont see the need to use something else to finsh the job. This works great for simple cleaning.
854,272,4,"UPDATE MAY 2014:  This winter the squirrels not only found out how to get around the baffle, but they regularly emptied this feeder.  They shimmied up the pole and leaped to the feeder, grabbing the metal mesh so tightly with their claws that they warped the mesh a little.  I still like it as a feeder and the birds are returning to Minnesota so perhaps they will get a chance to eat the seed and not have it all go to the squirrels.  And I will renew my efforts to keep the squirrels away from this feeder.I hadn't had a bird feeder in my yard for many years so I assumed it would take some time for the birds to discover this. I didn't expect that squirrels would find it the very next morning and be eating from it before the birds even knew it was there!I have my bird feeder hanging from a tall metal shepherd's hook.  The very first morning after I filled it with black oil sunflower seeds and hung it, I saw a squirrel shimmy up the hook and down onto the feeder.  At first it ate the seed out while hanging upside down over the top edge, but then it perched on the bottom edge and daintily picked out sunflower seeds with its teeth or claws.The good news is that the design doesn't allow the squirrels to dump a whole pile of seed on the ground or eat the seed really quickly. And they can't chew open the metal to destroy the bird feeder.I added a domed baffle to keep the squirrels away and so far that is working, but when winter comes and food is scarce, I suspect the squirrels will figure out how to get to the seed again.  In the mean time, Mr. & Mrs. Cardinal enjoy the seeds as well as some finches.This is easy to fill and the metal mesh design keeps the seed from falling out and messing up the ground beneath the feeder.  I like this bird feeder!"
1015,918,5,"I USE DEET SO THE BUGS WON'T EAT.It goes on wet - but it does dry quickly and is transparent to the wearer.  It is perfect for casual outdoor festivities when you don't want to look like you've been sprayed with diesel fuel.The Cutter Backwoods Dry 25% can be applied generously with no side effects - and it works.  The biggest negative might be the cost which is rather expensive.  However, when considering the consequences of not using adequate protection against mosquito viruses, cost is not a factor.If you are working outdoors and sweat profusely like some people I know, the longer lasting and stronger the better - as long as your skin will tolerate it.One problem I've had when I spray my face is DEET running into my eyes carried by perspiration.  I spray a Terry Cloth head band with Permethrin and wear a broad brim hat treated the same.  That seems to work better for me anyway.I've used most every mosquito repellant there is.  Some are better than others, however, even with the best, if you miss a spot, the little blood-suckin' buggers will find it.I spend a good deal of time outdoors during the summer months - and in Georgia - mosquito repellant is a necessity.For years, I have used the 40% Deet formula advertised for those who enjoy living in swamps and jungles.100% Deet causes a burning sensation on my skin.  It doesn't blister or cause a rash but it is uncomfortable.Clinical studies have proven that some people have an allergy to 100% Deet.I have an old military buddy in Maine who had to go to the hospital because he used too much 100% Deet on a fishing trip.As if West Nile Virus was not bad enough, in 2014, we have a new mosquito-borne Chikungunya Virus to worry about in the USA.  There is no vaccine and no cure.  It can last for 3 years and the joint pain can be excruciating.My formula is simple.  I apply a liberal amount of Permethrin to my clothing until damp. Sawyer Permethrin will last for several washings.  Don't worry if it accidentally contacts your skin.  It is harmless to your skin but it does lose its effectiveness.Next, I spray every bit of exposed skin with Deet repellant.  My face, ears, and neck especially appreciate the gentle kindness shown by Cutter Dry Backwoods 25%.Okay, maybe I do spray twice as much 25% as I do the 40%, but it feels twice as good after it dries.Auto makers use crash test dummies to determine the safety of their cars.I need a dummy other than myself that I can sit out in the back yard and fill will poison fake plasma and CO2 and let the mosquitoes suck on him until they die.Wouldn't that be better than a $350.00 propane mosquito trap that's only 50% effective?"
357,761,3,"We've never had any major mole (shrew) or gopher (rodent) infestations at my property for over thirteen years.  However, after my neighbor completed plowed (!) his backyard lawn this March, we've had many large dirt mounds appear in our backyard and numerous smaller dirt mounds in our front yard.  I decided to take action before my lawns become completely mutilated.  I tried many different methods includingThe Giant Destroyer Gas Bomb,Yard Butler Gba1 Garden Gopher And Mole Bait Applicatorwith Bonide Moletox 1 Lb.  Those tactics seemed to have worked for about one or two weeks when no new dirt mounds appeared but the following week I found large 20+ inch diameter circular dirt mounds; as if some larger animals dug up the dead carcasses of the moles or gophers.  To my dismay, I probed several new tunnels around the new dirt mounds which indicated the moles or gophers were still alive.  Time to bring out the big gun, the Sweeney Deadset Mole Trap.What's so good about this trap:>Easy to set up and activate once the main tunnel is found.>A lethal trap; if a mole or gopher sets off the trap, it is instantly skewered by six 3.5 inch metal spikes.>Easy to see the handle when the critters have triggered the trap.Problems encountered:>After one week, the trap was triggered but no dead mole/gopher.>With only one trap, it's easy for the wily moles/gophers to go around the trap and dig new tunnels.Lessons learned:It takes time and effort to properly locate the main, active tunnels and then PERSISTENTLY attack the moles/gophers to eradicate them.  Repellents are ineffective because the critters simply dig other parts of the yard.  I've learned that a combination of the correct toxic baits and multiple traps should result in a higher success rate.  By the looks of my yard, there must be colonies of moles/gophers rather than individuals.  I will execute my new tactics and hopefully won't have to resort to Operation Clear Yard (Napalm); too much collateral/property damage.  If all else fails, it's time to call the pro. exterminators."
431,208,3,"I have used it on one area of my yard where the grass is a bit unhappy. I have clay soil and compaction is indeed a problem. The tool works as advertised but1) make sure the soil is moist otherwise, at least in my clay, it was quite difficult to drive through. Here's where I wish the foot rest was a bit wider so I can place both feet on when pressing down2) you're up for quite a bit of sweat as, even when the soil is moist, it does take quite a few &#34;diggings&#34; to cover even a small areaI have not yet figured out if it's OK to just leave the little soil pellets (that are the byproduct of using the tool) just on the grass. My 3 year old son warned me to watch out about walking on the goose poop. We'll that's pretty much what they look like. In about 3 weeks since I've used the aerator the pellets are still visible on the grass."
381,783,5,"I bought this to hold the soaker hose down near my newly planted Evergreens. They did and still doing a great job. I have no problems of them breaking or cracking and we have seen 95F - 8F temperatures within last year. I have it for almost 2 years and couldn't ask of anything better. Also, I never had any problems with them breaking down when hammering down."
10,140,3,"To start with I do a lot of gardening. I have over 15 species of fruit tree in my yard, a 1000 sq ft garden, and also have a wide diversity of flowering plants in my yard to promote species diversity, attract beneficial insects, and, of course, for ascetic appeal.I use this humidity dome for both cuttings and seed starting. To cut to the chase the product does indeed work as intended with some caveats.Lets start with the heat mat. The heat mat itself works as intended. It keeps an even and warm temperature, but the diagram says to place it under the hot house, so the perfectly heated mat sits below not one, but two pieces of plastic with air in between them. Plastic is not a good conductor of heat, so the mat becomes far less effective if used as indicated. For myself I have a fluorescent tube light hanging a food above the humidity dome, so the heat inside stays a nice 85 degrees Farenheit.The dome itself has 3 vents. 1 at the top, and one on each side. Even with a number of adjustments airflow is stagnant. I open the dome and let a fan sit on it for a few seconds in the morning and evening to prevent stagnant air accumulation.Also it comes with a very, very small sample of Clonex, which is inconveniently placed in a package that makes dipping cuttings quite difficult. I get the product placement thing, but they didn't plan that one out too well.I'd rather pay less and skip the Clonex. I do however own and use Clonex religiously as I have found it to be the most effective rotting gel around. I just don't want a messy and small sample pack of it.I decided on 3 stars because all my cuttings and seedlings have done quite well, however, they also needed regular attention. An ideal humidity dome would require far less attention. on top of that the instructions tell you to place the heat mat in a spot that reduces its effectiveness."

95,258,5,THis is the chainsaw that always starts!  I gave away my gas chainsaws. It was the first Black and Decker 18volt tool I purchased. I Love this because I can get a lot done trimming around the farm. I have the alligator lopper and some others that I have purchased so I have batteries for extended use but the chainsaw and I usually run down and need recharging at the same time so it works well. I highly recommend this because my friends are buying them for their husbands because they are always borrowing mine for cleaning up their property.
1663,863,4,"Word of warning from the start: read and re-read the description. The description mentions &#34;Get up to 70 minutes of run time with the G-MAX 40-volt high-capacity 4 Ah and low capacity 2 Ah Li-Ion Batteries (included with purchase)&#34; which I didn't take as it includes one of each capacity battery. You get one of each which I was not exactly happy about. Additionally, extra 4 AHr batteries cost $149.99 list.On to the real stuff.I started looking at this when considering the various cordless electric mowers that are available. I like it better than the lead-acid battery based cordless mowers due to the size and weight of the batteries and the maintenance required for them. Our gas powered mower was getting annoying with starter cord breaks, oil and gas maintenance, and the self-propelled portion was starting to wear out. It was important to me to go green and make things simpler than gas powered.ProsOut of the box, this was so easy to set up. There was even a slight charge on the batteries to try it out (still, fully charge before use). It said &#34;team lift&#34; on the box but it wasn't that heavy. No tools were need to get this prepped for action.The first thing I noticed was the &#34;push the button, pull a lever and mow&#34; simplicity. There was no priming, no pulling the a starter, possibly multiple times, and no flooding. It just turned on and I was ready to go.Next thing I noticed was how light it really is. Coming off the weight of a heavy, self-propelled (weakly), all metal mower going to this largely plastic one was a gift. I didn't even notice it wasn't self-propelled. My initial thought was that it could easily have been built by Fisher-Price since it reminded me of my son's toy from so many years ago. Pushing it around is very easy.This thing is super quiet. Even more fun, it sounds like a bumblebee compared to the gas powered monstrosity I had previously. I even had a neighbor approach me after a mowing once with concerns that I was &#34;losing it&#34; thinking that, with my headphones on, I was pushing around a mower that wasn't running. I confirmed my sanity and explained the battery powered mower really does save your hearing.ConsI saw several references to uneven cuts and I would have to agree. Although some speculate that it is because the blades don't overlap, I think it is because of the mostly solid bottom of the deck. Most unevenness I found has been when dealing with dandelions that are so much longer than the rest of the grass. They tend to be missed if off to the side or dead center. There will also be some missed blades of grass on each pass, but I'm not meticulous about my lawn so it isn't an issue.There are quirks, too. I had the mower quit twice when it transitioned between batteries (the control circuitry uses one battery then switches when it runs out). Granted, it was early on and since then, I have only had it slow some, then kick in with the second battery.I also noticed that it adjusts the blade speed when the grass gets thicker. This is a great idea to maintain an even cut, except there is a time lag when you hit a change in the lawn. I have started working the system so that when I hit thicker lawn, I slow a little while the motor controller spools up the rpm's to handle the load. Minor issue, but the alternative is to have a machine that is psychic.The amount of time off full charge is a little less than advertised. It could be a smooth, even lawn that it was tested on so my irregular lawn might be what cuts the time down. I don't have a huge lawn, but it takes multiple sessions to mow it. Inconvenient, but I also don't get tired. If the weather cooperates, I get it done all in one day. Other times, it takes a couple.Overall, I am quite happy with this mower. I wish it had (2) 4 AHr  batteries instead of (1) 4 AHr and (1) 2 AHr. I also wish the motor controller was more responsive to changes in lawn resistance and better at the transition between batteries.None of this would prevent me from buying it again."
306,875,5,Nice grill brush.  I love the long handle so I can hold it with two hands; sometimes you need to put a little force to remove tougher grime and crust.  You can also use the two corners to get in to the harder to reach places of the grill.Seems to made of superior quality.  You can hang it trough the leather loop on the tip of the handle.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.
122,856,5,"This Sweeper is great for those small jobs like blowing out your garage, deck or pool areas.It's also great for driveways and sidewalks.It's very light compared to the previous model I owned.With the 36 volt Lithium battery you get a great long lasting charge.I've used a 16 volt sweeper before and the charge always died before the job was done.I'm very please with this sweeper. I think it will serve me for many years to come."

1286,566,3,"The handle has a nicely contoured, solid wood grip that's comfortable to the hand. The durable hoe blade, measuring roughly 2 "" x 3 "", is thick enough to resist any bending - its weld to the arm looks nice, too. However; the reinforcing sheath which is supposed to surround the hoe's wooden handle where it holds the metal arm contributes nothing to the structure of the tool, as it just rattles around loosely, unconnected to anything, as seen in the photo I've uploaded.Perhaps I got a stick that was lathed just a hair too much to where the sleeve can't squeeze the handle, so perhaps I can stuff split, half-toothpicks underneath the sleeve and press it down over them so it might hold in place. It's not such a major concern since this tool is most suitable to scraping about in small areas of loose, already workable soil in which impact breakage is not an issue.It's a handsome looking tool, with thick, durable parts. There is a leather loop for hanging attached to the hole in the handle. It's decent, but with the one small flaw with the sleeve which keeps me from giving it five stars. The quality is still far better than any of the inexpensive hand tools you can find."
122,946,5,The Black and Decker LST420 20-volt Max Lithium High Performance Trimmer and Edger is a great trimmer.It easy to set up out of the box. I have a small lawn and found that it was more than powerful enough for me.I usually got at least 20+ minutes from a full charge. The 2 batteries come in handy. I think this is a great value for the price.
390,364,5,"I'm pleased with this gas can, and so far it hasn't leaked. It also seems to be more vapor tight than my old can because I can't smell gasoline in my storage shed the way I used to with the old can."
1662,869,4,"We filled this up after it was charged and promptly got hosed down and the toddlers freaked out, lol.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT AWAY FROM YOU.  I know that is a stupid thing to overlook, but I thought I'd just remind people out there who also may be under-slept.I love how we don't have to keep the hose on with this sprinkler! The solar works great keeping it charged.It has a good motion sensor, but it does not spray the item it detects, it just hoses down the ""hot zone"" you set up. This is fine, but just good to know.  It would cost much more if it had that kind of sensor capability.This is so much better than buying fencing or using some kind of chemical deterrent.  Our area is raised garden boxes so it is easy to set the hot zone to keep birds off our tomatoes and veggies.  We have it on a lift to sense the birds easier.  We fill it up every weekend, takes a second and is good for days.It's about fifty bucks more than what I would be willing to pay to replace it if it were stolen or broke."
1281,932,5,"We got this model and the flat-flower model at the same time for testing. We have had hummingbirds at this house for 18 years and every year they come back for more. So we've tried pretty much every feeder model out there over the years. This one is absolutely perfect.I have this one on the front window, at my office. I'm in there all day every day so I can see clearly what the hummingbirds are up to. They adore this! For the first time ever, one of the females has set herself up at a watch-station in the bush immediately under the feeder and guards it zealously. That's loyalty for you! When she's away the others quickly zip in to grab their share.Yes, we do have others in the yard for the others :).It's very easy to clean and fill. I love how the large mouth means the air bubbles that come up during feeding are small, not large. The older style feeders would scare the hummingbirds temporarily when they burbled. This one doesn't phase them at all.Some reviewers talked about leaking. I have this one on a metal hanger attached to the house, and it's right against the window. So there's no breeze in there at all. It doesn't leak, but it's also not very breezy there. I can report that the other similar model is in the back yard where it is fairly breezy and it doesn't leak either.The ant guard works wonderfully.All in all, we love this, and the hummingbirds love it. Especially that zealous female :).I received a review copy of this unit."
0,433,5,"This is a nice idea to have both food and water available in the same vicinity. It also makes a nice appearance hanging in the yard. Yes, as some have pointed out, it is made of cheap material and will probably not weather well. But it is not likely that the birds will complain when the hanger tarnishes and the plastic gets scratched. For a relatively low price this brings a lot of pleasure to the feathered ones and to those of us who watch them."
881,844,4,"After trying many repellents over the years that never worked, I gave this a try and was very pleased with the results. The repellent in this works by hiding the CO2 we breathe with the citronella smell so the mosquitos can't detect you and therefore, don't decide it's time for a feast! I used this several times at night when the mosquitos are the worst for several hours and only had one bite versus 10-15 like I'd normally get. So it's not 100% perfect at repelling but it definitely works! The fan inside the lantern is very quiet and there's an on/off push tab on the bottom to power it. It actually came with the 4 batteries it needed so that was another bonus.Now to the reasons I gave it 4 stars:1. The box indicates that the cartridge it comes with lasts 3 months but when you read the fine print, it says if you use it a lot throw it out after 2 weeks of use.2. The light in the lantern is pretty but very dim so the light part is useless especially if you are taking this camping.3. My biggest complaint is that the little container of repellent is not resealable so if you want to store it for later use, you can't.Overall, this product is highly effective and I'd definitely recommend it over other citronella candles and similar products."
1510,167,4,"If you have unwanted guests munching on your garden. The does a great job at keeping away the unwanted guests. Also it is nice that I don't have to go trigger happy and drench the entire garden. It works good, and I would recommend it."
137,167,5,"This was so simple to use, comes with batteries installed in handle, shake it up and spray away. I have animal cameras in my yard so I know this really worked on the rabbits, I sprayed the base of my fruit trees, the edge of my whole yard at the base of the fence (1/2 acre) and the garden.The rabbits which were everywhere this year for some reason, they left, I did not see a rabbit for over two weeks after spraying, a squirrel who had just built a huge winter nest also left. I have not seen a deer in months so I can't say how it works on them yet, but the farmers should be pulling in the crops soon and than the deer start to come out more. Have to update on them later. I also get raccoons, opossum, skunk, ground hogs, and fox. After spraying they seem very interested and do a lot of sniffing around the sprayed plants, but have not eaten anything so I guess its working on them to. Nice my late season radish, lettuce, spinach, and peas are still there every morning. I do think it washed off a bit in the rain because over the last few days I noticed rabbits in the yard again. No problem as the one container is still 3/4 full. I will spray again. I like this stuff."
475,658,5,This is a great way to recycle coconut shells! Make charcoal biquettes out of them. I used these in my good ol' grill and they worked like a charm. The  Porterhouse steaks I cooked tasted great! Gonna try chicken breasts text time... Very recommened by this man!
758,201,5,This works very well for spraying the garden with insect soap.  I wouldn't be without one.  This one I purchased for my daughter because mine works so well.
404,666,5,As we had just move into our new home; we needed something to cook with outside.  We purchased a charcoal grill which lasted a little over a year.  We have a nice large cooking unfinished patio; so I decided that a natural gas grill was the only way to go.  It is so nice not to run out of gas in the middle of a big cookout or the mess of disposing of the remains of a charcoal ashes.  It takes about 10 minutes to preheat and after that the fun begins.  We use a Weber rotisserie and several other small accessories.  The smoke box we use is on the small side because we do not like a heavy smoke flavor.  Cleanup is a breeze and takes about 6 to 10 minutes.  As we live in Florida we keep the grills oiled with Weber oil that also prevents meat from sticking to the grill.  A minor tip is always wrap sweet potatoes in foil.  My DGD failed to do so and it took about 15 minutes to clean her mess up.Getting the gas connected from the house to the outside of the patio was my biggest problem because of my grill location.  I did all the digging and the gas man install the pipe and inspected all of the connections.We have had several cookouts as I like to use MY grill.  It is very easy to adjust the menu and items selected for as many come to eat.  My favorite is a large beef roast (6 to 8 pounds) with grilled vegetables.  The meat is cooked to everyone's liking from rare to well done as you do the slicing.
234,792,3,"It does okay for the small finches, but I keep having to go out and tip it a little to get the water to come out, I tip it too much and it just runs out, it doesn't self refill. But when the water is there, it works great. I don't see this problem with the other reviewers so maybe it's just an issue with the one I have. I have it on the deck too, so all the birds can use it, not the just the very small ones as hanging it would make it impossible for the larger birds like the doves to drink. They do use it when I remember to tip it so that it can refill, so it is useable, just not self refilling."
963,351,5,"I received this bird feeder one day before we got a snowstorm, so we had cause to put it in the yard immediately. Almost as soon as it went into the yard it quickly became the most popular feeder in the yard. Weathering the storm the next day really showed this feeder's strengths.This feeder is marketed as a squirrel-proof feeder. It's not, exactly - too much plastic instead of metal so a squirrel can gnaw through it in time. I would call this feeder more ""squirrel-resistant"". That said, being squirrel-resistant is actually not this feeder's strength though it is a big positive. The way this feeder's anti-squirrel strategy is implemented is by spring-mounting the wire sheath on which the feeding ports are mounted. When a squirrel gets on the feeder, its own weight works against it and the wire sheath slides down, closing the feeding ports. It does work, though the enterprising squirrel may find ways around this depending on how the feeder is hung.Adjusting the sensitivity of the sliding mechanism is easy. The springs that control the tension can be moved to increase or decrease the tension with one hand in about 5 seconds (if you're slow). This is nice - it does not require disassembly or special tools.Though this is a squirrel-deterrent feeder, that is not where this feeder's strengths lie. This feeder has two very good features that make it better than a lot of other feeders of its type.First, this feeder has six feeding ports, and each has a short perch that is suitable for small songbirds and very awkward for larger birds like grackles. We have more troubles with grackles than squirrels and as such this feeder is already doing well in comparison to the other feeders we own. Second - and this is very important - the feeding ports are designed to avoid giving up all of the seed in heavy wind. In the middle of a storm, it is not unusual to see all of the seed blown out of a feeder in a short period of time, requiring more frequent refills.The biggest evidence that this feeder is well-designed is how it attracts the songbirds. This is by far the busiest feeder in the yard now. With no squirrels or grackles chasing off the other birds and no wind blowing all of the seed out on the ground, this is a feeder that allows us to watch birds instead of continuously refilling the feeder.I am very pleased with this feeder and heartily recommend it. With this feeder in the yard, you will spend more time birdwatching and less time maintaining the feeder."
1567,166,4,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder, and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault, I hung it too close to the house, but it's all I've got, really. So I watch the squirrels, who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic, so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it, which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price, it's a terrific feeder!"
1614,403,4,"This fire ring comes in a box in four pieces( the quarters of the steel ring) and a small bage of parts ( nuts and bolts for attaching the ring quarters) and two semi-useful little wrenches. If you have ever put together Ikea furniture than you will be fine at putting this together, takes less than ten minutes. I would recommend wearing a pair of gardening loves as the nuts and bolts are a bit greasy. I had a slight case of mechanics hands afterward.It's been continuously rainy this month so I haven't gotten to have a fire yet, the wood is kept outside and is still wet. I'm a bit worried how the black matte finish will hold up down in a fire so I'm thinking of building the fire ring up with a few courses of block and than having this as a decorative piece at the top so it's not getting licked directly by flame. The cut out horses are so nice it would be a shame to ruin them."
1038,955,4,"When I was asked to try out this lamp I was really excited since I thought that it would be good for more uses than just grilling...and I was correct.My only issue with using it for other things is the short amount of time you get from the batteries.  More on this later.Yes this is a great lamp for grilling as everyone has pointed out - but it is also a good thing to keep in your car  to aid you if you ever get a flat tire.  It makes a perfect lamp to attach to you headboard and read by.  It is perfect to attach near your entrance door for those nights that you forgot to turn on the outside light and are fumbling with your keys and packages. It is better than walking though the dark with a flashlight since women can simply attach it to their purse handle (if it is thick enough) A simple tap turns this very bright; almost flood-light like lamp on.It is good if you need a concentrated beam of light when you are working on some household projects.  The head moves up and down, but does not swivel, but it can still help when you need both hands to handle tools and a flashlight won't cut it.Unfortunately for some of these uses the batteries don't last long enough.  Which is okay if you use rechargeable batteries and leave the battery cover off to make it easier to change them out.I experimented and found that I had gotten about 3 hours of non-stop light - this is perfect when used for its intended purpose - but not quite long enough for reading.  Too bad that it is not rechargeable!So all in all this is a great product to use for what it was meant to do, but is also good to have as a back up light in case of power outages.Sample sent for testing and reviewing purposes.i"
981,329,5,"This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )"
1423,392,3,"This could have been a great accessory, but it's awkward to use. First, the build quality is very good. Assembly is simple, but, once again, Weber provides NO written instructions. Unlike their grills, however, this thing is hard to screw up. I find the size useful. You can put a stack of plates and a few condiments and have room to spare. I find the hooks useless unless your utensils have lanyards.I've taken two stars away for two reasons. First, it attaches to a grill that has WHEELS, which implies movement. It's awkward moving the grill with table attached. So you detach it. Here's why it lost another star. If it's detachable it should have folding legs so it's stowable.Awkward to use, awkward to store. Otherwise, works well. Three stars."
708,95,5,"I bought a Suncast SS1000 Storage Seat to place out back to hold the bags of dog treats I always have out there. I had considered getting a plastic storage bin to keep birds and rain out of the treats but this is a much nicer solution!It's roomy enough to hold at least three 5 to 10 lb bags of dog biscuits, and it keeps them nice and dry and safe from other critters.It require no tools to assemble, and went together in less than a minute. The lid is hinged and lifts easily, and when closed it slightly overlaps the base to keep rain out.I have a Suncast deck box which has stood up to the elements for a couple years now and still looks great (no easy trick here in the Arizona desert) so there's no doubt this storage seat will do the same.Although I use mine for dog treats, you could easily use it to store garden tools, a hose, toys, pool supplies, or anything you'd like.I'm pleased with it and give it two thumbs up."
1209,222,5,"I had some of these that I bought in case  I ever needed them. They were easy to toss in a drawer in the greenhouse and were ready to go when I did need them. They are an effective way to start seeds.Just don't allow the seeds to bury themselves so far down in the material that they can never find their way to the light of day. That's true no matter what kind of seed-starting material you use, of course."
1281,939,5,"I'm sitting on my back porch watching hummingbirds sip from this feeder at this very second while I write this review. They absolutely adore it.We've been feeding hummingbirds at this house for 18 years now and we have tried pretty much everything over those years. If you've seen a style of hummingbird feeder, we've probably played with it. Right now we have probably twelve different old hummingbird feeders in a bin by the shed that I keep for who knows what reason. Out of all the styles, this is the one we're using now and we (and they) love it.It's quite easy to fill. The wide mouth means the liquid goes in easily. When they drink it doesn't create a large &#34;air bubble&#34; that temporarily scares them off. We have this on a double shepherd's crook in our back yard so it's not &#34;super stable&#34; by any stretch - and it doesn't leak at all. The ant water trap at the top works just the way it should and we just refill that each morning when we put it out.I'm surprised by people who complain that they have to fill the water each day - aren't you refilling your feeder each day? Or bringing it in at night? If we don't bring ours in, raccoons climb right up and drink from it :). And we like to give our hummingbirds fresh nectar each day - sugar-water in the sun is not an eternally fresh item.I'm not sure what to say to those who have a leaky unit. We haven't had any leaking at all and, as mentioned, it's hanging in a breezy location. Maybe it's something about how tightly we screw it. Part of what keeps a feeder from leaking is the vacuum that forms.In any case, our hummingbirds adore it, we love it, and this is our new favorite for the back yard.I was offered a free sample for review."
1413,777,4,"This is an attractive, fairly large feeder. It says you can use 2 kinds of feed, but I just have mixed seed in it. (I have the Perky-Pet Grandview feeder next to it, filled with sunflower seed.) It's made of metal, with a pretty dark copper color. My wild little friends like it fine. My only complaint is the soft braided hanging wire. If it was more rigid towards the top, it would be much easier to hang."
1117,820,3,"This fire pit comes with all you see in the picture, plus a tool so you can lift the lid once the fire is lit a vinyl cover to protect it.  So assembly is easy, if you do it the right way the first time, lol.  My husband is great at assembly required projects and has even built many wonderful things from scratch.  My husband looked at the pieces and said ""this doesn't make sense"" they way they have the bolt, screw, and washer connect to the bowl so he put it together the way he thought it should be, and it was wobbly.  Then, he figured out the legs have to be on a certain side for the base to fit so that it has a stable base.  So, he took it apart and put it back together, and it holds together fine.  Unlike other reviewers, it hasn't moved on its own or made noise, despite recent bad weather so ours seems stable.  I agree with one reviewer being puzzled by the suggestion of sand at the bottom of the bowl, when it has holes in the bowl.  We put tiny stones.  Perhaps they don't want you to put a fire directly in the fire pit, but that seems to me to defeat the purpose for some people to have to buy extra things for it to be safe. We already had the tiny stones. When I read about not putting it on the deck and then what they said about sand, it made me wonder if they said those things so people can't sue them, lol.  We got it for free because I review for Amazon vine, so can't speak whether it is worth the cost, but those that paid for it seem to think not.  It looks great, but of course you want to be able to use a fire pit safely.  I will send updates if anything happens to the product after we have used it more times.So to recap for us it is stable, looks great, and is usable."
1366,754,3,"The Nooski is an awesome mouse trap.  I purchased one last year when I noticed some droppings in my kitchen.  After setting it up with peanut butter, it caught the mouse very quickly with no mess or gore and I haven't had issues since then.  The mouse died quickly.  I walked out of the room and back in shortly after to find the mouse completely dead, so it couldn't have taken long.Loading the Nooski is a bit confusing at first, but very easy once you understand.  If you are having trouble, there are videos on Youtube showing how to put the band on.  Once loaded, the band is visible from outside the trap, so you can check and make sure it hasn't sprung on its own.  It is large enough to not hurt you if it snaps around your finger.With all of my praise, I unfortunately have decided to give the Nooski three stars because is is so flimsy.  It is very easy to shatter the thin plastic, even if you are being careful.  I do think it is worth it regardless, but make sure to tell anyone who handles it to use a lot of care, and be prepared to buy another before you use those 10 included bands.  If the Nooski is remade with sturdier plastic and perhaps tighter bands to ensure the immediate death of smaller rodents, it will be a 5-star product.  Even as it is, I prefer it over spring traps."
1273,713,5,"I have been using this bait for years. I purchase big containers from a pest control company and use either small bait traps that were purchased on-line or bigger traps that are on a concrete block and purchased from the local branch of a national pest control company. Mice don't bother with the bait much during the summer, but like it in the other seasons. It has worked well for me in my country home. I have never had any problem with decaying mouse odors. I also use traps (I like JT Eaton 409BULK Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap, For Solid or Liquid Bait (Pack of 24) ). The combination works well for me. I never have had my dogs or any neighbor dogs show any interest in the bait, but something strong at night (raccoons?) have messed with them a few times.The refillable holders I have been using require a metal key to open.  I tend to misplace the key.  This has latch that you push to open.  It was a little tricky (maybe I should have read the instructions), but is easier than finding that key.  The top is clear.  I am not sure why it has the lip on the side as I can't think of anything I would hang it over.  Mice like to run along walls and that is where I put it.This is a tier 1 station, meaning it is made to be weather resistant and so can go outside."
1683,592,5,i have a yard that is populated with plenty of fire ants and carpenter ants. i am using terro ant bait to try to lower their numbers and to keep them under control. it is working okay so far. it is very easy to use. the plastic container is a shaker and makes it easy to apply the granules to mounds of ants. it is a slow kill product so the workers take the granules they collect down into the mound to share. i can see some good results. so far i am happy with this product. thank you!
1407,241,4,"We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too."
1158,894,5,"As a little background, we live in the country, we have an acre of land, we garden and my husband works with the local land trust clearing trails.  We have a lot of experience with garden tools and have learned to look for the Fiskars brand when we shop for tools.  This Quantum Hand Pruner is lightweight, preforms smoothly and should last pretty much for the rest of our lives.  It comes with a plastic blade cover, which is a nice touch, but we keep it in a leather sheath so we didn't use it."
1434,874,5,"I was interested in trying these because I wasn't sure I would actually use all of the types of veggies included so I wanted to just grow a small amount to start and help me plan for future gardens.  These little packets were perfect for that purpose.  I was able to try a nice variety of lettuce, herbs and tomatoes as well as beans, peas and cucumber.I really appreciated that the seeds were non-GMO, which is important to me and difficult to find.The packets were simple and easy to pop into a small container and they yield wasn't so much that they overgrew the container I planted them in.  I didn't have to go back and dig them up for spacing later, it was already planned for with each packet.If you're interested in growing a small garden for whatever reason (small space or just want samples like I did) this is perfect.  All you need is the containers and the dirt, everything else is done for you.  It would be great for growing a small garden on a balcony or patio.  I will buy these again and give them to my daughter for her apartment as she loves to garden & cook with fresh veggies."

245,634,4,"After reading reviews & doing homework before purchasing this umbrella screen...some reviews helped out alot in telling how & what to look out for... so I was very skeptical at first, but I figured I would'nt lose out too much because of price.As mentioned before, throw out the little sheet of paper ( supposed to be manual directions of how to install ). This is useless, you have to install by trial & error.First: I purchased a 8ft. umbrella because I did not want to go thru headache of 9ft. being to big... good thing I did, this screen just fits the 8ft. umbrella perfectly, if I had a 9ft. the screen bottom would'nt even touch the ground.The screen came in perfect condition, no holes or tears.In our case as mentioned in reviews, we had to first put screen over umbrella partially opened, & while the whole umbrella was lowered on ground... just draw in the string adjuster... then start opening umbrella slowly being careful not to tear screen because screen is very cheap & lightweight... we then put the umbrella on stand on table... then opened umbrella up rest of way... best with 2 people, 1 on inside, other out, then you can modify screen evenly adjusting all the way around. The person outside might have to stand on a chair or some type of platform to draw & tie string adjuster.  Be careful zipping & unzipping, take your time ( again this is cheap material ).We did fill in tube at bottom with water, & do not fill tube all the way, as soon as water reaches all the way around, stop. do the same with adjusting & positioning tube as you fill. BINGO... you are done.We have had this up for a few days, no leaks, keeps insects out... so far it works. Don't no for sure what we will do when a bad storm comes, because I can tell it will be a little difficult bringing down & back up.. as read before, we might have to velcro strips around screen to keep in position.I would recommend this product because its a cheap way of providing comfort without dealing with insects... just do your homework before purchasing."
1458,685,3,"I purchased this in August, 2013.The timer was accurate and weather-proof.  It work well for that season and I moved it indoor for winter dry storage.  This weekend I pulled it out to ready the yard for the season.  During the storage it somehow sprang a leak.  I am planning to request a repair under Orbit's warranty as it is supposed to be a 5-year warranty.  We'll see how that goes.  Perhaps other uses did not experience this problem."
116,263,5,"I recently purchased the Toro 51599 Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum and have been using it through the fall ""leaf season"".  Below are my pro's and con's.Pro's:-  The air blast from the blower and the suction while vacuuming/mulching is very strong, and the variable speed for the fan is a great feature.  I've found that I need a lot less air when blowing leafs from hard surfaces and more air when dealing with damp leaves, so the ability to variably adjust the fan speed is a strong point-  Its reasonably light weight and requires little to no maintenance when compared to a gas-powered blower-  As advertised, it converts from a blower to a vacuum/mulcher in a matter of seconds-  It's a very good mulcher, although the description is wrong when it says you can take 16 bags of leaves and mulch them into only 1 bag.  In typical conditions, you'll probably mulch what would have been 3 or 4 bags of leaves into 1 bag.  The metal impeller is a plus, too, as it's much less likely to shatter than plastic impellers on other units.Con's:-  Its loud, and when mulching dry leaves, throws off a fair amount of leaf dust.  Be sure to wear ear protection and a mask.  (Although this could be said of most, if not all blowers/vacs.)-  The leaf collection bag mounts directly onto the unit, so it's a bit uncomfortable/awkward when you put the bag's strap over your shoulders and mulch leaves.  A foot or two of hose would have made it a lot more comfortable to carry around.As an aside to the last point, I also bought the Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8 Foot Hose and the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket, thinking that it would make leaf collecting and mulching even easier.  However, I found that the basic setup that comes with this unit works better for me than using the hose and bucket (I'm a man and can handle carrying the bag around when mulching).  If you plan on mulching you may want to buy just the blower/vacuum and give it a try before spending money on the hose and bucket like I did.Overall, the Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impeller worked very well, and when you consider the price, it's an outstanding value.  In general, I find it to be a very efficient and effective leaf blower and leaf mulcher.  While it won't completely eliminate having to rake flowerbeds and tight areas, you can greatly reduce your time and effort collecting leaves."
922,924,2,"This is a mediocre feeder. It isn't sturdy on it's own, so make sure you hang it somewhere it can be leaned on for stability. Birds might or might not like that. The birds around here seem to not be big fans of it.In terms of how tight the seeds are keep -- that does provide a nice seal, so that the deer aren't attracted to it.If you have a small townhouse or a balcony in an apartment, this might work for you better than the regularly-sized big feeders."
1276,366,3,"This is a plastic container, not a can, and as over-priced as anything else but there's few alternatives to paying too much. I picked up two of these at a local store for about 19 bucks each but I have the same issues with them as others. The spout is too short to reach my vehicle's gas tank and though I use a funnel it's hard to hold both without spilling fuel. The spout is also not rigid enough to hold the can on the fill tank while you lift it and if you don't lift it you're not getting much gas. They also swell quite a bit when it's hot... as with most summers here in the desert... and though never kept in direct sunlight they do leak vapor and need to be vented often. I'm in a rural area and have purchased a few old metal gas cans at yard sales and they run circles around these things. Someone commented they like the screen to protect their generator but where are they getting gas that could be so dirty? I don't like storing gas but since I'm about 20 miles from a gas station and have lots of gas operated machinery there's not much else I can do so having cans that swell & leak are a concern... but that's just me. honestly... isn't 30 bucks (today's price here on Amazon) a little too much for a plastic gas container?"
784,761,2,"We have a Gazillion Gophers, and hoping this would work!So far it has not.This is fairly easy to use..Wet the area where the earth has a new hole, or where the gopher has pushed up the earth.Although this has still not worked for me!!I'm going to give this another try with putting  some fresh Green veggies leaves into the hole..I have to say this is big, and it is made very well.Gave it 2 stars for that.If this works, I will be back to add on to this review.."
1346,426,5,"This is the fifth inexpensive umbrella I have purchased on Amazon since 2007 so that's about one per year.  Usually the wind takes them out though the last one was just terrible - the canopy itself was attached poorly to the frame and the cord that lifted the umbrella broke after about 30 days (that item is no longer sold on Amazon).This one out of the box and in the table is great so far but I COMMIT to coming back to add to this review in a few months to comment on the durability.  It seems like anyone can put together a seemingly decent umbrella but how they perform longer-term is what I'm interested in when I purchase one.Here the pro's and con's so far:Pro's:- Nice crank, works with a satisfying ""click"" and is easy to turn- Good canopy, blocks the light, stitching is well-sewn, only one loose thread (cosmetic)- Center pole is standard sized... my last umbrella required a larger than normal hole (2.5"")Con's:- The supports for the umbrella are aluminum.  Some higher-end umbrellas (which admittedly at this price this is not!) use PVC/plastic which gives more in the wind.  I suspect these ""arms"" will be the weak link of this umbrellaOverall this is a screaming deal at $42 even if the thing only lasts one summer.  So far, so good, highly recommended!Update 7/8:  This umbrella survived 4th of July picnics and some pretty gusty winds... operation is still excellent and it's holding up well so far!UPDATE June 2014:  This umbrella is still going strong, works and looks GREAT!  I am very pleased with this umbrella."

196,246,5,"I was impressed when I felt how heavy this connector is.  I was worried when I couldn't get the on/off valves to budge.  They wouldn't move at all.  Before I gave up and sent it back, I got out a pair of pliers.  Success!  After they had been turned once using the pliers, I could then turn them by hand.  I like the grip that helps you to attach the connector to the faucet so the switches can stay facing out.  The fit was tight and there was no leaking.  I anticipate this connector will last for a very long time."
1373,665,3,"When a rat discovered the bird feeder, we decided to try this trap and see if we could relocate it.  It was a pretty good size, probably from the steady diet of bird seed, but it was still smaller than the rabbits that keep the yard trimmed.  There are also a half a dozen squirrels that hang around the feeder, but our goal was the rat.We baited this trap with peanut butter and put it directly under the bird feeder.  I was a little worried about finding a bird in there, but the birds weren't interested.The rabbits were interested, though.  I've lost track of the number of times I've seen a rabbit wedged into this trap.  Happily, even though the rabbits are almost too big to fit, they've never triggered the trap.  And watching them wriggle out backwards is hilarious.Nothing else has triggered the trap either.  After replacing the peanut butter about 6 times, I gently touched the trigger to be sure we had set it correctly.  We had--the doors snapped shut.Mechanically, it seems to work.  It is easy to set and easy to release.  It doesn't seem to require a lot of pressure to trigger the trap.  It is also apparently easy for the local rodents and rabbits to take the bait without triggering the trap.  It's a great idea, but it hasn't worked for us."

369,874,4,"I enjoy gardening.  I plant A LOT of different crops and when I have pest problems or nutrient problems, I feel comfortable enough to find answers online.  When something dies prematurely, I view it more of a learning experience and feel better prepared for the next planting season.This product is an interesting concept - I can't help but smile when I look at it.  Inside the foil packaging is a 14"" (L) x 8"" (W) x 2"" (H) cardboard container that opens up to display 18 ready to plant pods.  The literature is simple and tastefully done.  They include plant spacing (with a paper ruler), recipes, tips for growing, and websites for additional information.  You basically take the cover off of the biodegradable pods (there is more nutrient literature under each paper lid - I was unable to view this as my paper lids stuck together), push the pod into your soil, and then remember to water.  You could plant most of the pods indoors (close to a light source) or outdoors.  You could also plant in pots or right into ground that has been properly tilled.The variety of vegetable and herbs provided with this kit are the ""easy to grow"" varieties.  You'll receive Basil, Cilantro, Dill, several varieties of Lettuce and 2 different Tomatoes, a Snap Pea pod, Cucumber pod, and a Bush Bean pod.  Basically, you provide adequate water and it grows.  Each pod has Miracle-Gro plant food in the tip of the pod and at least 2 seeds in each pod.  If you get more than one seedling in each pod (and you probably will), you could carefully separate the seedling but for the novice gardener, it would be easier to simply pull out the weaker/smaller seedlings once the strongest seedling is at least 2"" high.  You're guaranteed to have a plant grow - They claim satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.  I suspect more information is available on-line to exercise the guarantee (there was nothing specific in the included literature).I couldn't help but think that kids would LOVE this product.  What a great Birthday present for the child who has a Spring Birthday - Seed Pods that just need pushed into soil and perhaps some small gardening tools.It's a cute product but if you're an experienced gardener - I rather doubt you'd see any economical benefit in this product.  Seeds are incredibly cheap and even if you were to plant each of the varieties in this kit with seedlings bought from a nursery, you'd likely pay less than what this kit costs (and the seedlings would produce a fruit/vegetable faster since it's weeks ahead of a newly planted pod)."
1376,954,5,"This pair of cooking gloves are useful for handing very hot items on the range, on the grill and in the oven. They are so much easier to use than regular oven mitts. So far, I have tried these in 450 degrees, 500 degree oven and using my broiler.What makes these gloves so special is that they grip my pan from the oven or one I remove from the stove, there is no slipping and it keeps the pot in my hand safely.So easy to clean as I just rinsed them out with hot water and let them dry in my dish drainer and they were good to go!Like these so well, I threw away all of my old oven mitts and potholders.These fit well and easy to use.Highly recommend this set.Cooking gloves provided for testing and review."
1480,272,5,"I adore this feeder.  First off, the bright red color is striking and really adds to the look of my garden.  I wouldn't mind if it came in a variety of colors.  The quality construction stands out as soon as you open the box.  It is solidly made out of metal. It is easy to fill and hang.  The birds seem attracted to this feeder more than the others I have.  It makes for a nice feeder for black oil sunflower seeds.  I haven't noticed the birds having trouble getting the seeds out as others have stated.  I don't believe, however, that it will hold the 15-20 birds at once, as advertised. So far, I highly recommend this feeder."
1367,91,5,"I wanted to test various parts of my garden soil to check the pH levels as well as the N, P, and K levels. This kit makes it a breeze. The pills are conveniently labeled and the instructions make it simple to understand what to do. The colored indicators make it easy to tell where your soil currently is at and the instructions give suggestions on how to adjust the levels should you need to."
299,644,3,"Started baiting this trap over a week ago, first with bacon and then with chicken bones.  To date, no catches.  When I first selected this trap, I had in mind the feral cats that often (almost nightly) visit our compost area.  You would think bacon and chicken would lure them in quickly, but alas...this has not happened yet.  If and when it does, I'll post an update to this review.That said, the trap is exactly as advertised.  You can easily set it with one or both doors open to catch the small varmits that are plaguing your property.  Engaging the trap is as simply as turning the handle position from one side to the other.  No fuss, no muss.If you're looking for a humane way to capture small animals and relocate them - this trap is exactly what you need.  Provided you can get the animals to enter it - I'm still waiting."
1249,674,5,"This is such a simple product, but thankfully they work. We had tiny little moths that seemed to come into our home from packaged grains that we purchased from the grocery store. Once we had them, they just seemed to multiply. I didn't want to use toxic sprays or cleaners in the pantry so I was happy to find these easy to use pantry pest traps. All you have to do is fold the traps into a triangle with the sticky stuff inside and open the little dot with the pheromone (a scent that attracts the moths) and drop it into the trap so it sticks on the side. Then just set the trap in an area where the moths are. You won't be able to smell the lure, but the moths will.It takes a week or so to trap all the moths, and each trap lasts for up to 3 months. I was surprised at how many moths it trapped. We also used one in the garage near the bags of bird seed and thistle. Moths seem to be attracted to that too and we caught a lot of them in there. Two thumbs up for a safe and effective product."
1369,167,4,"On July 4, I went out my front door to find a deer sitting in my beautiful pink lantana bush, which they are not supposed to eat.  Nevertheless, the deer have been mercilessly eating the flowers off this bush for the past several months.  As a test, I sprayed the Havahart on the lantana, a rose bush, and a cypress tree (deer rub antlers on these), these three plants being holdovers from my re-landscaping last September.  No smell...wonderful.  I decided to give everything a second spray the next day, just because.  On July 14, I checked the plants for additional deer damage and found none, despite the fact there are new blooms on everything.  So far, so good, and I will update this review for product effectiveness as time passes.Here are my comments about using the product.  Havahart really is odorless.  If you have ever used Liquid Fence, you will never forget what that product smells like; I gave LF up because I tired of my yard smelling like a sewer or something rotting, not to mention myself.  It is very difficult to get LF off your hands and clothing.  Havahart comes with explicit, and detailed, instructions, including to never put the sprayer in your mouth (lawyers).  Two things should have been included.  One, never mind the directions, the nozzle on the sprayer, as it comes, fully screwed in, will give a spray once the priming occurs.  If you want a stream, then you have to turn the nozzle a quarter turn.  This information will prevent you from getting the liquid all over yourself (which I did).  Second, for best results, you want to coat plants on a dead calm day, versus windy.  After each use, I would also recommend taking off the nozzle and rinsing both it and the other side it connects to with water to prevent clogging.For over 20 years I have been gardening in a deer infested area.  In my experience, the main deterrent that works, and is most cost effective, is fencing, at least six feet high.  After that, for open areas and if you want flowers, you have to do your homework and cultivate strictly proven deer resistant growth, such as oleander, daisies, lantana (usually), iris, and possibly azaleas (at least in California).  I had to completely redo my front yard in order to mostly persuade the deer to stop the munching.  The reason why deer resistant plants are so important is because Havahart, like all commercial deer repelling products, is expensive (not to mention the batteries), especially so if it comes ready to use and because it must be consistently, and perpetually, reapplied.  It is also costly to continually replant the items that the deer destroy.  If you persist in keeping plants that deer eat, in harm's way, then you are forced to continue paying for products such as Havahart.  Also, sooner or later, you are going to forget to reapply, or it rains, and the deer will prevail anyway.August 7 update:  Regarding the effectiveness of this product, it has been over a month since I applied Deer Off on two consecutive days to four plants in my front yard.  Everything is untouched.  I am really impressed, considering the activity these plants endured for the preceding six months.  However, I stand by my recommendations for fencing and hard line deer resistant landscape as the best defense against deer.  If you do not mind the endless expense and continuous hassle of spraying, then I certainly recommend this product."
592,3,5,"I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water. This nozzle is durable, easy to remove, and super strong!"
400,283,5,"I have used these traps for years now. You simply open the pheromone lure and drop it into the trap. They are pretty effective in luring the pantry moths, and once in the trap they stick to the adhesive. Although I have minimized my pantry moth problem greatly, I still have them appear every now and then, but to a much lesser degree. I don't know if it's possible to eradicate pantry moth infestations 100% but keep at it. I store any potential food sources for the moths in the freezer or in air-tight containers as much as possible."
442,722,4,"I am generally in the I-have-a-black-thumb camp, but this spring I decided to really give some plants a try.  I trotted to the nursery and promptly fell in love with a miniature citrus. I brought it home with a big ceramic pot with one little drainage hole in the middle.The nursery worker told me that they didn't recommend putting a layer of stones on the bottom of pots. So I plopped the poor tree in in this big pot with nothing but potting soil. The pot sits outside, sitting on a decomposed gravel area, which has a binder.  Though water does drain through the decomposed granite, I've been fretting (most unlike me) over the tiny drainage in this big pot.And then I got this durable pot filler disc. It really is neat. Dense enough to keep the soil on top but loose enough for easy drainage through it. Not biodegradable, in this case a good thing. And, according to the directions, when/if I change pots, I just pull the Garden Genius Pot Filler Disc out, rinse it under the hose, and it's good to go in the new pot.Though it was a mess to replant the citrus tree to add this disc on the bottom, I'm happy with how the disc appears to work. The size can be trimmed if needed.  The disc may not be suitable for a small (low depth) planter, though, as it is almost an inch deep, and it's harder to cut the disc lenghtwise.If, in the future, I find out that the disc was not a good idea, I'll amend my review."
1317,941,4,"I needed a small, easy to hide hose to water plants. This lightweight hose fit the bill perfectly.  Basically a tube enclosed in a fabric sleeve, this expands when the water is on and collapses when not in use making it very easy to store/tuck in a small hose basket.  I also like the metal fittings which hopefully will hold up much better than the plastic fittings that tend to come with a lot of hoses these days.  No issues connecting to outside faucets or connecting various attachments.However, if you need something with a lot of power you'll need a wider hose circumference than this.  My husband used it to clean off the deck and it didn't have as much pressure as our regular hose.  It did work a better when he took off the spray attachment - enough so that he didn't bother to drag out the regular hose."
1058,270,4,"As some reviewers have noted, this cover tends to run smaller than what is required to realistically cover a 44 inch fire pit.That being said, if you have one of the excellent Landmann 40 inch pits like we do this will work great for you and it is definitely priced right."
264,961,5,"I never knew that these existed and now that I have a set I wouldn't want to be without them.We had pulled pork which I made in the slow cooker today and I used the claws to lift the roast from the crock and to shred the meat for sandwiches. My crock is pretty deep and I struggled to get it out with the claws but once I had it on the serving platter I really like how the claws shredded the meat. This would make a great add-on gift for someone who likes to grill as you can lift the meat off the grill very easily with these claws. Would be a great stocking stuffer, too."
809,445,4,"This is a must have for the little Intex pools. Not only does it clean up all the dirt, it sucked up almost of the dead algae that the filter is just not strong enough for. Last year I ended up dumping my pool due to algae..this year the Aqua Broom was a lifesaver! My pool was clear within a day! Used for the Intex 15' by 48""Metal Frame pool. Thanks"
1582,524,5,"I got this for my parents, who are building a cabin in N.C. and already have several other hummingbird feeders hanging from the roof of their back porch.They say this feeder works very well and attracts hummingbirds. They actually have another that's almost identical, but without the yellow centers of the 'flowers' like this one has.For some reason, hummingbirds in their area prefer RED feeders. They also prefer RED / pink fluid in them. I think my parents are going to trash their older feeder and use this one in conjunction with another newer all-red feeder. I don't know why, but the hummingbirds just seem to like drinking red nectar from a red feeder.Not sure if this applied beyond the mountains in N.C. but it may be useful info, so I figured I'd pass it on.Anyway, this is a nice feeder and definitely works... if you're thinking of a) starting a hummingbird 'hobby' or b) supplementing / replacing your current feeder with this one, I recommend."
720,193,1,"For two days, I've giggled with glee upon seeing the unit's flashing red light of SUCCESS. That was until I kept coming up EMPTY and disappointed the bugger got a free meal. I've reset and refilled with a few dog kibble about 10 times and zapped NOTHING! I've been dry toweling the plates after every 3 entry and departures to avoid dirty build up that could impede the powerful, much desired RAT DEATH RAY.After attempting to access the Ratzpper.com website which is UNAVAILABLE, I called the 1888-DEAD-RAT several hours ago without a callback. Now those furry critters are catching a break until I get sturdy traps and toxic waste disposal gloves. I HATE mice, rats & most icky rodents and have no plans to continue running a fine dining establishment for them.This contraption is too blankity-blank expensive to be a bust. In case you haven't guessed it, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this thing!PS CALL Amazon Customer Service if purchased through them for a refund.UPDATE 1/22/2013A smart and pleasant Technical Support person from Raticator called with helpful hints. Having a moist cloth/paper towel leading to the front of the Ratzapper acts as a WELCOME MAT to a ""shocking experience"" when the critter makes contact with the metal plates inside. The Raticator company provides support temporarily for Ratzapper which is no longer produced. With that in mind, you need to consider that when getting a Ratzapper. Getting a refund and finding a consistently working pest eliminator is my goal."
415,341,4,"Love this product! Within 4 days, my yard was poop free. Easy to set up. Seems to work great!"
544,829,3,I like using but not anymore than my other ones.  I do like the shorter handle.  I'll keep using it though because it does work.Fast delivery.  I was very pleased.  Thank you.
1265,932,5,"Living in a cold part of the country and up in the mountains, I am yet to see my first hummingbird.  The feeder appears well-crafted.  The company that sells it on amazon has a map on its website where it places dots when people report hummingbird sightings &#8211; you can watch their northward march as they near your home."
1349,874,3,"It is difficult to accurately review this product as it was just received a few days ago.  The climate and temperatures in my area would not be conducive to planting the cool weather vegetables, particularly salad greens.Starting some of the other varieties of tomatoes could possibly yield a small harvest in early October, based upon harvest schedule.  However, based upon my own past experience, this is not likely.The herbs, dill, basil and cilantro would have a better chance of 'taking off' as they say in the garden world.The concept of the pods is a fun option, and could be a wonderful learning experience with a youngster.Most home gardeners, however, are looking to a plant system that would yield more than one plant of any variety (as seeds in these pods are to be thinned to the one strongest per plant).It would be beneficial if planting sticks identifying each pod were incorporated with this set.Cost wise...an expensive option, for a serious gardener."
538,577,4,"I had thought this would have been the right product for me to get rid of a couple troublesome mice that have been getting in my shed. Turns out that this is not the case.The hole where the mouse goes in is just too small for the breed of mice in my area. I was expecting to just go back out there after a couple days and be able to just dispose of the pesky rodents and go on about my business, unfortunately not the case. So I sat out there one day while working on some things and noticed a mouse trying to get into the trap but it couldn't fit it's head in the whole. It's not like we have rats out here or anything, just simple mice.Rather disappointing.While I did end up catching 2 others with the boxes and disposing of them I still had to deal with the larger one of the group with a normal trap. Too bad they couldn't have been a little more accommodating and made the traps a little more universal.I still rate them high though due to the fact that they are rather effective and clean up is extremely easy, just pick them up and toss them."
581,797,5,"We hung the bird feeder on an ornamental bracket outside the kitchen window about 10 days ago, a few feet away from another red plastic Perky Pets feeder that has been very popular with the local hummingbirds for a long time. They completely ignored the new blue one, so we switched positions with the red one. They still ignored it and kept going to the red one. Finally, after ~10 days we took down the red one and put the blue one in its place in the original position and they found it right away! So it doesn't appear to be the color that is off-putting after all.July 1st update - the hummers visit regularly now but usually only when the feeder is in the shade. They don't appear to like it when it's hot and sunny. Some hover in front of the feeder, sipping daintily; others perch on the edge slurping voraciously. I intend to bring back the red one now and see if they still visit both feeders.The antique blue glass is so much prettier than the red plastic container that I may eventually retire the red one completely and replace it with another glass feeder. It is quite sturdy and has a large capacity. To fill it you must invert and screw off the perch at the bottom and thoroughly rinse all parts before refilling with fresh nectar. We make ours from sugar and water (no food coloring) and they seem to like it as well as the mixes we've used previously. Do not turn it right side up until you are back outdoors, to prevent dribbling sticky nectar on the floor (it's a mess to clean up ! )The feeder provides us with an opportunity to watch the fascinating parade of hummingbirds from inside the kitchen window or outside while sitting in the yard. I have posted 3 images of hummingbirds enjoying the buffet at our new feeder."
1663,577,4,This is a great mouse trap because it is totally enclosed and you never have to see or deal with a dead mouse. You just pick up the trap and throw the whole thing away. I normally try to recycle but I am ok with not having to see/smell a dead mouse. This trap is easy to set and use.
1515,941,5,"This expanding hose is the handiest hose I've ever used - it's so easy to move around, and really delivers a lot of water. My neighbors commented on it so much, I decided to move it to the backyard, for fear of losing it! Just kidding, but everyone seemed to notice it and ask where they could get one like it, so it generated a lot of interest - especially when I was washing my car - a couple neighbors even wanted to try it out, turning the hose off, then on, just to see it grow! I couldn't get any help washing the car, tho!"
56,923,2,"Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet."
1270,490,4,"Just a couple of days ago, I was looking through some old boxes in my garage, and noticed something hopped out of one and darted away.""Great. I've got a mouse to deal with."" I thought.Without thinking too much about it, I mentioned (read: warned) my wife that there might be a mouse in the garage.""Don't you remember when I said it looked like mice had eaten all of those peanut butter bird feeders I made, and kept in the garage?"" In truth, I did remember this, but figured the unseasonably warm autumn had melted the peanut butter, or that it had otherwise mysteriously disappeared from my historically mouse-free garage.The next day, a scream filled my living room. My idiot dog brought in a freshly killed mouse for us all to enjoy.""Great. Now I've got many mice to deal with.""I went straight to the home improvement store. Not even Amazon Prime could bring justice fast enough. If there was a mouse-catching robot, I probably would have bought it. My objectives were:1) Must be safe enough to not snap my toddler or idiot dogs.2) Must not be a poison that would potentially leave mouse carcasses in old boxes.3) Must not terrify my wife and / or daughter upon ""use"".But apparently, these traps are the most advanced ones the store carried, next to some dopey ultrasonic thing that would most likely send the mice in to my house or shed if it worked well enough to annoy them out of my garage.Since peanut butter brought 'em, I figured peanut butter would bait 'em. And just hours later, my theory was proven correct. I was a bit concerned about the traps being potentially inhumane after reading many of the reviews, but to date, the mice have not complained."
254,868,5,"I am very pleased with this! I love finding quality items made in the USA and this one did not dissapoint. The 14"" is perfect for a cascading hanging plant like fuschia or ivy. I like the look of this, very natural and non-plastic. This was easy to put together and suprisingly light weight. Huge bonus, no leaks when watering!I will definitely be searching for more from this company in the future."
1617,789,4,"This fire pit looks great. I was afraid of the way the copper would look over time but it only gets prettier. It's simple but attractive.It does require some assembly, but nothing too difficult. The only issue is that it says to put sand in the bottom to distribute the heat more evenly but there is a hole in the bottom to allow the fire pit to drain so we were concerned the sand would just fall through. We skipped that step and it still works great. We've considered filling in the hole because we keep it covered anyway, but decided not to because it seems to work fine without the sand.We have the fire pit on our pool deck and it looks great. It is the perfect size. It comes with a poker/lid remover and a vinyl cover. The vinyl cover is good quality. The lid of fire pit really does do a great job of preventing sparks. Overall this is a great fire pit."
1279,918,5,"Cutter's Backwood Dry insect repellent sprays on wet but dries quickly.

17,859,4,"Usually I would say that packaging products together like this is gimmicky and silly, but in this case I think it is a really useful idea.  Getting everything your mower needs in a single package is very convenient and at the current price is even cost effective.  Just make sure you are getting the right kit for your model mower."
625,875,5,"I bought this for twice the current price to use on our new Weber grill. My husband normally does the grilling (and, yes, the cleaning), but I did use it once. It works very well so even though I paid a lot more for it, I don't regret it. To me, it's the right length and the handle has a reasonable comfortable grip. The bristles are firm, and the little pieces on the ends fit perfectly to get a close scrub on those stubborn pieces of burned-on food. It seems completely safe to use on the grill. We've had the flat-based brushes in the past but prefer this one."
1248,790,5,"I love watching the birds on my patio eating from this bird feeder. Even when the birds aren't around, this feeder looks like a really pretty lantern hanging down. It's easy to use and seems to be quite sturdy."
718,561,4,"The unit is good, better in many ways than the Flowtron unit I also have.The Worx unit shreds the leaves finer, seems quieter, lighter (or at least easier to carry) and better built. It seems to put out more dust than the Flowtron, but any unit will obviously put out enough dust to require eye protection and make mask use a good idea.Unfortunately there are a few small but really annoying, failures.1. Paper yard waste bags do NOT fit. I tried fitting several different types over the stand - no bags are wide enough to fit properly.2. It can't sit on a trash can. I'd prefer to do this but it is too narrow to sit atop any of my trash cans.I have been using a ""Contractor style"" garbage bag, thick and strong, to capture the shredded leaves. Fine for me as I dump the mulch in a compost bin or over my garden, but it'd be difficult to pour that into a yard waste bag for municipal pickup."
757,912,5,"I haven't used a Weber grill before, and so I was really impressed with the quality of this one.  First thing I noticed was how heavy it was - I had to really struggle just to get it off my doorstep.  Once I did get it inside, putting it together was very simple, screw on the lid handle and put the pins in at lid hinge set the grills down and your done.  I really like the fold out side trays, and the fact that everything folds in on itself very neatly for portability.  For this grill, I felt like it's strength was also a bit of con - it is so well built and sturdy, that it is almost too heavy to carry around.  Perhaps putting wheels on one end and making it where you could tilt it up and wheel it around would have been better.  In spite of it's weight, I still really love it and think it deserves 5 stars because it is so solid (nice thick lid, and sturdy thick grates) that it will likely last longer than me.  I don't expect I'll ever need to buy another camping grill.  I plan on purchasing the griddle insert before my next camping trip, because I love the idea that you can leave one grate in, and then put the griddle in where the other grate would be - eggs on the griddle and sausge on the grate, yum!"

1,712,5,My first thought about mealworms was EWWW!  I didn't care who was going to like them I did not want to be handling them.  Then I ordered these and they are really not bad at all to work with.  First of all they are freeze dried so no yuck factor.  The birds LOVE them... I have a bluebird that pecks on my window now whenever the dish is empty.  So.. your birds will love you!
505,298,4,"This unit works very well, and does so for mice as well. Slight nit-picking in that that LED only notifies for a 24 hour period of a kill. I keep this in my garage, and might not go in for 2-3 days. If there was a kill on the day after I was in, I wouldn't see the light blinking if it was a couple days later. It would've been just as easy to design this with a longer blinking ""Kill"" light. After all LED consumption is very minimal. But this doesn't affect the effectiveness, so it still gets 4 stars!Safe for kids it says on the site here. I guess it is safe in the sense that there are no poisons. The included instructions say to keep away from kids and pets. I imagine it would give a bit of a jolt if they stuck their hand/paw into the trap."
714,885,5,"Because I live in earthquake country, I love owning this GOAL ZERO NOMAD 7 ULTRA-LIGHT SOLAR PANEL.  I hope that I'll never REALLY need to use it, but it's a wonderful addition to my emergency-preparedness equipment and supplies.  When unfolded and placed on a window ledge with the solar panels facing bright sunlight, it charges my Android smartphone quickly (adding a 15% charge in about 30 minutes).The NOMAD 7 is very light in weight, and is suitable for backpacking.  The device does NOT store a charge--the panels must be unfolded and exposed to sunlight for it to operate to charge any device.  How fast it charges depends in part on how much sunlight is reaching the panels.  It works best in direct sunlight, but it also worked for me on partly cloudy days.The built-in power port has connectors for charging 12V devices (Sherpa and others) and USB devices (cellphones and others).  You will need to supply the USB cables to connect your USB devices.The literature says that the panel will charge cellphones,  iPods, and tablets.  It works well with my Android smartphone; however, an iPod Touch (4th gen) delivered a message that the solar panel was incompatible, and my Kindle Paperwhite (2nd gen) repeatedly froze after beginning to charge (requiring a full reboot to be operational again after each attempt).  So I would recommend using the NOMAD 7 with care (stay with the newly connected device) until you find out which of your devices are completely compatible.  But it's still a great piece of equipment to have on hand for charging cellphones in emergency situations."

You have to be patient, too!We are diligent about our composting:  We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn, many gardens, many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard.  So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material.  We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting:  It makes the turning and churning a breeze.  But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate, we still need an accelerator every once in a while--especially during colder months. And then sometimes our mix of ""green"" and ""brown"" material is not quite right.  Sometimes we just want compost fast--well, at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress.  We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting:  Even with our Mantis compost-maker, we still have compost makin's left over.  So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence.  We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8'x8'x8' triangle.  When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5' tall pile, it fell 1 1/2' within a week.  So, do not doubt that it works.  Also, you can simplify your composting efforts--it's not the most efficient way to go, but it is better than no composting at all."
423,912,5,I got my first Weber for my husband a couple years ago he always wanted one but I was turned off by the price. As it turns out they cost more because they are truly superior. All my other grills lasted about 2 years if we were lucky. We love this Gem one it is great to have an electric grill we use our gas for allot of outdoor cooking purposes and it sucks to take food outside only to realize you are low on gas not a problem with this Weber Q Series Portable Grill. It is a top quality grill cooks effectively and evenly.It comes in a very large boxassembly took about 15minwe got 5 nice size steaks on it (which cooked ridiculously fast)great portabilityno propane/no charcoal- no problemAnd of course it is made from top quality material heavy duty porcelain-enameled cast iron make no mistake you will have this for many years.I'm off to grill some steaks right now!!!I should mentioned the Weber 54060001 Q 2200 Liquid Propane Grill is just as good we have no complaints with either.
630,96,5,"We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However, my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them, leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard."
403,20,5,as advertised..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product. I've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and haven't ever been disappointed with the quality...... good product..........
1094,858,5,"This clever idea is pretty darn awesome!  First of all, the container rocks.  It comes apart and the top part becomes a really nice funnel and the bottom part can be used as a bucket or for whatever you need.  Then the little thing of oil and the filter are nice and handy to have around.  I keep it in my garage and I feel good knowing those things are there for when I'll need them."
1608,230,5,This is by far the finest made and most useful shovel I have ever used. I have been gardening for over 60 years and have never been more pleased. The extra width for placing your foot is especially helpful. It truly is The Greatest Shovel ever made.
838,374,5,"great to find a replacement for my weber, I thought when my old one rusted away, I'd have to get a new weber, but instead I got the replacement at a fraction of the cost of a new weber."
11,936,5,has a nice loomy feel and smells as it should...I have started a seed box and was excited to get and use this...I will report more as my flowers grow
1276,430,5,"I've been a diehard user of the Lightning Nuggets Firestarters 100 count that sells for about twenty five a box. I'm cheap and always looking for an alternative because the Lightning Nuggets are really too large for me and I didn't really want to cut a bunch in half on the scroll saw. These are small and the burn rate is pretty accurate in the 15 minute range. With these selling at around fifteen for a box of 144 that reduced my cost-per-start from a quarter to about a dime and that's better than if I cut what I have in half.If you don't care about some dirty hands and smoke then use some crumpled newspaper and a cheap lighter. I have an old Blaze King wood stove and when it's cold it's hard to get a good draft to draw the smoke up and out so these little smokeless lighters really work for me... and there's no newspaper delivery here.I wouldn't recommend these if you don't have some really dry kindling and logs. I use the Lightning Nuggets if I have some damp wood to get the extra burn time on the start. These come in 12 thin bricks that are scored with 12 starters that you must break off to use. They light easily, don't burn out and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat."
1149,904,3,"But.....it wasn't entirely clear HOW one was supposed to administer (and not administer) this plant food.  Sprinkling it on top of the pots/beds where pansies are planted, which appears to be the preferred method of administration, has its clear downsides:  the squirrels and birds had a virtual field day nibbling on the stuff.  I will try mixing the food with soil rather than sprinkling it on top next time.  But....I'm guessing that the birds and squirrels won't be deterred."
41,565,5,"This is a great product.  Built well, very sturdy and fairly weighty, not bendable.  The bronze finish and design on it are very attractive with my green windowbox in it.  I think it would look even better using a terracotta color planterbox or individual pots.  It is adjustable and expandable.  Our deck railings are fairly wide and also have the boarding that the individual vertical posts/sticks/whatever they're called, are nailed on to.  This planter holder has a strong metal brace that fits down against that boarding, making it have an even better ""grip/support"".  No tilting forward, holds the box or pots up evenly.  The brackets going over the actual railing are connected to the holders own brackets by screws facing upright, so there is no actual putting anything into your railing.  My description is probably making this sound hard to assemble but it really isn't!  Enjoy! These are nice!"
1306,792,2,"My Perky Pet Water cooler is too small for all but the smallest of birds to sit on the ledge while drinking.  There is no stabilization so it swings back and forth as soon as a bird does land on it, consequently the bird flies off because it's swinging.  You have to take it completely down to fill and then screw off the bottom which is where the birds poop is. I wouldn't recommend this product just because you have to get it down from the tree, and then touch bird excrement and then the birds don't use it anyway because it sways and is just too small. Mine did not come with a hook to hang it so you'll have to find your own S hook or string to hand it with."
64,285,5,"CobraCo's hand-hammered copper fire pit will be an attractive addition to nearly any outdoor setting. The copper color of the fire tub is warm and inviting. It's hand-hammered and uncoated, which gives the tub a rustic appearance that fits with the outdoors. As a result, the tub will discolor and weather naturally over time. After just our first fire it lost the copper color and took on a darker appearance with some spots of copper showing through. Also, after only the first use, the screen cover started rusting - a natural process I'm sure, but thought buyers would want to know.As a family who enjoys frequently roasting marshmallows, reading stories, talking, and entertaining around an outdoor fire, this fire pit is a great addition for gathering people around an outdoor hearth. The pit's design and look will complement most any decor. The pit is deep enough to hold a good amount of wood.No assembly is required. The pit must be used over a non-flammable surface such as slate, tile, brick, or stone. It measures 30 inches wide by 19 inches high with the cover. The set includes a sturdy stand, the fire pit, a screen cover, and a protective vinyl cover."
1539,286,2,Some time ago I wrote a glowing review about this seed but the last batch was sub-par at best. There was almost no sunflower in the mix and the sunflower seeds that were there were small and dried up. The main ingredient was millet. I'm very disappointed.
1077,287,5,"I use this cart a lot more than I thought I would.  I typically buy a lot of products at a nationwide wholesale club (Sams), and I use this cart to wheel all the food and etc in from the driveway to the kitchen.  It works great.I also posted a picture of us using the cart during an extensive shower repair, and it hauled broken concrete just fine.I had my doubts about the dumping mechanism, but it works well. The back wheels ""scoot"" forward, and I was worried that they would not when I was using it on uneven terrain.  But it works fine.I have played with the reversible handle, but haven't actually used it.  its an interesting design, the handle is on a pivot and spins.  At the top you pull it by hand, remove 2 cotter pins and spin it 180 and it can be towed.  Haven't actually used that feature.The only thing I would add is something that kept the handle ""up"" because it falls too readily.I have used this cart in more ways than the average person (hauling goods, construction, and gardening).  And I can tell you that its really quite good.  Maybe its not perfect for you, but it will be good enough for most people.  Well worth the money."
684,98,4,"Inexpensive, this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial, ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price, it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside, readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading, but nothing specific.  That's probably okay, however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need."
1576,476,5,This seems to work great! The hummingbirds are enjoying the feeders with no ants thanks to this! I would recommend it to anyone with the Perky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
963,145,5,"We have several feeders on our property and every one has been plagued with greedy squirrels that monopolize the feeder and keep the birds away while they wipe out the seed. We have tried putting seed on the ground for the squirrels, greasing the mounting poles, and we even tried putting one feeder on a Twirl-a-Squirrel, and none of these tactics have worked. My wife found the Brome Squirrel Buster Plus here on Amazon and we decided to get one and give it a fair try. It has proven to be a very good feeder that's worth its weight in gold.This is a tube-style feeder that has six feeding ports on a spring-loaded, movable sleeve that slides down when sufficient weight is added. The idea is that the squirrel's own weight works against it and causes the sleeve to slide down, cutting off all access to the seed when a squirrel tries to steal from the feeder. The sensitivity is adjustable so that the weight can be tuned to help discourage other pests such as grackles.The sleeve is made of metal which is important. If it were plastic, a squirrel would quickly be able to chew through it and eventually reach the seed inside.It's not enough to simply rely on the sleeve to slide down. Squirrels are notoriously smart and would simply reach the ports by hanging upside down from the top of the feeder and helping themselves - except that this particular feeder is designed with a built-in baffle in the lid. It's not a traditional baffle that wobbles and moves; instead, the lid is shaped and painted such that there is no way to hang on to it while trying to reach down so squirrels simply fall off while trying.This is a well-constructed feeder that has a lot of thoughtful design features. As mentioned, the important parts (the sleeve and feeding ports as well as the baffle lid) are metal and are chew-resistant. The metal portions of this feeder have all been painted with what appears to be weather-resistant paint which will deter rust and corrosion (and it makes the feeder harder for a squirrel to hold on to). There are adjustable perches for each feeding port as well as an installable cardinal perch ring.We watched one very determined squirrel try to get the seed from the feeder and after trying for a while it gave up and dropped to the ground without success. The squirrel wasn't hurt, the feeder wasn't damaged, and all the seed was still there for the birds. This is exactly the result we hoped for. We still end up filling it frequently, but now the birds get all the seed, not the squirrels.This is a large feeder and it holds a lot of seed.The Brome Squirrel Buster Plus feeder is exactly the feeder we had hoped for. It is very well constructed, it holds a lot of seed and it keeps the squirrels out of that seed without hurting the squirrels. It is a little on the expensive side, but it's worth every penny and then some. With this feeder, you can get on to the business of feeding the birds without fattening up the squirrels in the process."
218,612,3,"I really don't enjoy cleaning windows or mirrors, which is why I ordered this product.  I thought it might make this chore a little more pleasant.I use white vinegar to clean mirrors and windows, with the usual technique of spray on, rub all over with a cloth to clean, dry with another cloth.  The Karcher Vac generally eliminates the rubbing step by combining it with the drying step.  However, I did find occasional areas that it did not completely clean, such as a few toothpaste splatters and a suction cup mark.  I have to keep a cloth with me anyway, to remove the more stubborn spots and dry again.I have to hand dry the final area where the squeegee was touching the glass each time I lifted it off, because it leaves behind a wet line.  Also, if anything gets stuck on the squeegee, even just a tiny bit of fuzz, this leaves behind a streak until you wipe the squeegee off with your cloth.The instructions tell you to take the squeegee part off, then take off the yellow plastic section between the squeegee and the handle area, to finally be able to remove the tank for emptying.  This is a tedious operation, not to mention unnecessary.  The hole and its rubber plug for emptying the tank are on the outside of the appliance, so you can just pull the rubber plug, turn the whole vac upside down over a sink, and it will drain.However,the rubber plug is difficult to remove, as are the squeegee and the other plastic part that must be removed to empty the tank according to the directions.  The product description claims this vac will make the chore easier for those with carpal tunnel or arthritis, but I think people with these issues would have some difficulty with these stiff components.This appliance is also rather large.  I don't have enough room under any of my sinks for it.  The squeegee is 11"" wide, and the appliance is 14"" tall, which makes it awkward to store on a shelf.  Plus the battery charger needs to be stored with it, taking up more shelf space.The lithium ion battery is lightweight, and does hold a charge for a long time.  However, it is not replaceable.  This is the reason I don't own a hand vac, I think it is wasteful to throw the whole thing away when the battery dies.  When the Karcher dies eventually, I won't be replacing it.  It's a novelty, but didn't make the job any easier for me, just different."
616,910,3,"Yes, this a larger than normal at home fire pit.  It has some decorative additions to it and comes with a top cage and also comes with a cover. It also is very easy to put together and did not take much time.  However, we have been disappointed on a couple of notes.  The edges are very sharp and although easy to put together, does not feel very long lasting.  The top cage does not rest very securely on the top, and the weather covering is USELESS! Ours did not even fit over the fire pit and when we first tried to even get it over each corner it ripped because it was so tight.  And although we did makeshift it to fit on, the fire pit is already rusting quite bad and we have only had it a month.  May be fun for this summer, but not sure it will last through another!"
344,349,3,"I thought this product would help me quickly plant the hundreds of bulbs I wanted to plant, and looked forward to using it to get the depth and width holes needed for my many different bulbs.Boy was I disappointed.First, I was trying to plant many of the bulbs in soil next to perennials, many of which had great root systems.  When I tried to drill next to the plants, to plant the bulbs, I destroyed the root system.  Not good.Second, I couldn't get this roto planter to drill deeply into the clay soil we have here; the roto planter would freeze while drilling.  My HAND bulb planter worked more effectively than this product did.  It also didn't work in soil that had any small rocks in it.Third, this roto planter's shaft is difficult to secure in a drill.Overall, I think this product is great for  ""perfect"" soil, but wouldn't suggest it for anything other than rock-free, clay-free, root-free soil."
261,325,2,"I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market. I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product. It leaks now and it is not that old, does not dispense evenly, I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking."
1683,895,5,i enjoy using my miracle gro feeder on all of my vegetable garden plants. i can give special treatment to my plants as needed. its fun to use and it works great. the results are great. i am very happy with this product. its a time saver. thank you.
960,928,4,"I figure that this review will take a few weeks to complete, as I want to wait until I see the final results before I settle on a rating.With that said I spread Lawn Restore over my lawn this past weekend. I live on a quarter acre, and I would say that the Lawn Restore covered about 75% of lawn. Luckily the conditions were perfect, and we've had showers off and on over the past 3 days, with rain continuing today. According to the instructions, the lawn should be kept wet for a least four days after application, so I should be good to go.I will update when I see any change or growth.Update 1: It's been two weeks since spreading Lawn Restore, and I have to say that my lawn seems to be growing very lush and thick where I fertilized. I also notice that I don't have any weeds popping up where I spread the Lawn Restore, but have scattered dandelions where I was unable to spread the fertilizer.I will post another update in a week or two.Update 2: This will be the final update. The Lawn Restore did a solid job in thickening up my lawn where there were patches. The grass is thicker, the lawn more full where I laid down the fertilizer. I will say that the dandelions have spread to the fertilized area, so I'm not sure if this is what you would want for a week repellant, but it worked great on thickening up my grass."
244,337,3,"Who can resist the tiny delicate hummingbird?  I love seeing them in gardens at flowers such as coral bells, honeysuckle, columbine, delphinium, trumpet vine and other plants that tend to have a bell like blossom.  This feeder when filled with a syrupy liquid will attract the lovely creatures too but it is a bit of a pain to put together and if the user is not very careful spills and leaks are a fact of life.  Holding forty-eight ounces this is the &#34;grand master&#34; of hummingbird feeders but I still prefer the old fashioned method of feeding them with flowers thus receiving the additional benefit of more beauty and color in my yard."
1366,912,5,"Electric grills are the shame of some urban meat eaters, but with the Q 2400, they can finally crawl out of the shadows and stand up proudly.  It may have a plug, but this is no dressed up griddle.  It is a grill and does what grills do.BUILDI have a Weber charcoal grill, and found the quality substantially better than most common brands.  The same applies to this portable size.  Everything is heavy duty and has a premium look.  The hinge is sturdy and should last for years without issue, and the lid could take a heavy beating without losing functionality.The grill surface is the same heavy porcelain-enameled cast iron that I have enjoyed on the bigger grill, which holds heat well and is easy to clean.  Speaking of that, a thorough cleaning is not too difficult and the drip pan uses the standard size, which means that you can buy disposable liners if you wish.FUNCTIONIt is a very strange feeling to warm up a grill without a charcoal chimney or tank of propane.  Instead, it only requires being plugged in for 20 minutes with the lid closed.  Make sure that your outdoor outlet can handle the 1560 Watt draw, which is similar to a space heater on high.  A standard circuit should be fine as long as nothing else (garden tools, etc.) is on it.  If you are going to break the rules and use an extension cord, make sure it is properly rated for the job.Adjusting the heat requires no airflow management.  Instead, it is all handled by twisting the knob.  Bring your own thermometer if you doubt the guidelines in the book, since one is not built into the lid.The moment of truth came when I dropped my first animal product onto the grill.  To my manly delight, it sizzled and smoked just like any other grill.  It also made beautiful grill marks.  I also was able to use wood chips similar to a propane grill to add some flavor.  The food was delicious, with a clean flavor unique to this type of grill, but still a distinctly &#34;grilled&#34; flavor.  I was worried, but it was able to stay very hot despite it being cold outside.SUMMARYThe rituals of grilling, particularly with charcoal, are absent with this unit, but beyond that psychological barrier, it delivers proper grilled food.  As with other Weber products, it is superior in durability and grill surface.  The only significant change I would prefer is a built-in thermometer."
94,376,5,"I used to own a Weber Q-100 but it was stolen.  I then purchased a Q-200 but I replaced it after several years with a Char-Broil TRU Infrared Grill2Go X200.  I wanted a cover for it and this one fit perfectly.  It keeps my grill dry, clean and free of dust.  I will buy another one when this one wears out."
593,487,5,Works just fine.  It's much heftier than the last one that cracked from living in the garage- I anticipate this one will hold together better.
564,189,4,"I got these to use around my garden, as I live in the country and we have frequent deer guests who love to munch on our corn seedlings, flowers and other garden plants. I placed the spikes as directed and put the lure liquid in as directed- the set up was easy. Just about anyone could set this up. After around 3 weeks, my plants are untouched by the deer. I saw one deer come up and then suddenly jump and take off, so I'm sure that it was the shock from the Havahart that sent him packing. Hopefully, it will keep working.One big warning with this (as stated on the packaging) is that if a small child happens upon these spikes they will get a shock as well. My niece, when we weren't watching got a bit too close and got a shock that upset her. So, if you have small children that like to wander or play out in your garden, I might advise against putting this anywhere they could wander into it."
1542,449,3,"Because I am such a big fan of the Safer Brand Pantry Moth Trap, I am trying this Clothes Moth Alert Trap for the Vine program to see if I have any moths that would ruin clothes.  I haven't seen any moths, but better safe than sorry.  The traps come two to a box.  Each trap is a tent shape, open at both ends, with sticky surfaces on the two inside walls.  The scented bait square is dropped through a hole in the bottom and sticks itself at the center of a side wall.  Moths can smell the scent, but humans cannot. After two weeks in my closet, the clothes moth trap didn't show any moth activity, so I placed it in the garage where I get pantry moths.  At the same time, I placed a new pantry moth trap in another spot of the garage.  Both brands are Safer.  Within a week the pantry moth trap has at least a dozen little moths stuck to the inside of the tent.  The clothes moth trap has none.  Does this mean the clothes moth trap is ineffective?  Not necessarily -- it could mean I don't have this type of moth.  The Safer moth traps are geared toward a specific moth, and you need to figure out what kind of moth you have in order to purchase the correct trap.  Based on my experience with pantry moths, I have confidence in the Safer brand and wouldn't hesitate to buy this product if I saw clothes moth activity.  While I give their pantry moth trap an enthusiastic 5 stars, the clothes moth trap remains unproven."
644,26,4,"I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18"" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."
1320,177,5,"It may be an odd way to start a review, but since it's the first impression (and it was a good one), I'll say that the carrying case on this unit is brilliant.  The shoulder strap, well-placed handle, and easy functioning zipper are all sturdy make transporting this portable paddock a snap.  Total weight is amazingly less than your standard camping tent.Set-up is also remarkably easy, even to the unitiated.  First timers might want to budget 30-45 minutes but after a time or two you should be able to secure the structure within 10-15 minutes (depending on your terrain).The fact that this operates on 2 ""D"" cell batteries is remarkable, making this kit truly portable.  The product description states it will operate for 30 days on those 2 ""D""s (amazing!).  I have not tested mine for nearly that long, but bringing a spare pair of batteries wouldn't be a hardship, I'm sure.I'd have some concerns about the integrity of this kit if you're trying to pen a ""spirited"" animal.  Make no mistake: this is no fence.  A more docile horse (or other animal) with electric fence training/experience will be safe and secure with this well-designed gear."
569,778,5,I am using this with a common wrought iron hanger under a tree in our yard. I am on a second course of bird seed and it is fun to see the smaller birds (mainly Finches) feed methodically.  Larger birds (Jays and Doves) attempt to feed but frequently can't support themselves and there is much flapping of wings and bird cries. It is easy to assemble and disassemble and is very attractive in our yard.

947,550,3,"Ahh summer time in South Carolina!  I love fresh produce and always keep some in the house year-round.  Of course every summer the fruit flies find their way to my home too.I usually keep a tiny jar (Baby Food) on the kitchen windowsill with red wine vinegar and soap to trap the little buggers.  It usually does the trick pretty well, but its not that attractive to look at.When I saw this little Apple shaped trap, I thought, oooh pretty!  That would dress up my kitchen window and serve a needed purpose as well.Upon its arrival, I opened the package and read the very simple instructions.  Just pull off the lid, discard it and fill the chamber with the bait liquid.  Simple huh?Well I pulled and tugged but no way that lid was coming off, it wasn't cut out.  Finally, I took a razor blade knife, sliced the top off, and then proceeded to fill.I placed this little apple on the window sill and waited.  Now a week later the chamber has attracted and trapped numerous victims.  Its done the job!This would be a much welcome addition to my kitchen if it was refillable, and not disposable.  I would see no need to re-purchase a new 'apple' each month, if the design was tweaked a bit.  I may try to clean this out and refill with vinegar & soap.  I'll update my review at a later date."
391,903,5,Man this made my lawn as dark green as I've ever saw it and I put down new seed also to over seed what is there now and those seeds popped up and the bare patch I made to fix a sprinkler leak is totally covered up to the surrounding existing lawn .. all less then a month is very cool weather here in the N.E
819,467,5,I use these with my chimney starter to light my charcoal and there is nothing better. Leaves no smell on the charcoal like lighter fluid and is safer. I use one cube under my chimney starter and 20 or so minutes later I spread my charcoal and start cooking. Great product and cheap.
895,229,5,"A neighbor puts out whole peanuts for what was one squirrel.  Now all the squirrels in town know about it.  They get a bunch of peanuts, all that will fit in their mouth, then come to my flower pots and flower beds to stash them for later.  Not only are my pots & beds sown with peanuts, they dig up everything!!  As soon as I received the product I put out the Havahart Critter Ridder and no trace of squirrels in the pots or flower beds since.  I smoothed the dirt before spreading it and it is still smooth!!  There are no deer around but there are cats...  I don't see signs of cats digging and covering poo out there, but it's harder to detect (until one is digging in the dirt to insert a new plant).  I haven't tried this powder around the edges of the back yard plantings yet to keep my dog from going into the area to 'talk' with the neighbor.  If it DOESN'T keep out the dog, I'll be back to let you know.  So, if you don't hear from me again on this...  it's working for the dog too.  Yeah!!!!  Finally something that truly works (and even after a rain or two on it).  Oh, it was very easy to spread with the built-in shaker.  Since my areas are small I just barely lifted the lid section intended for spreading the product and the right amount came out.  For larger areas one might want to open it further to get a handfull for broadcasting, although I believe it works best as the label describes, to just sprinkle it around areas where you do not want critters to enter.  It's working!!7/9/2012 update:  Saw a squirrel head down the fence top yesterday so it's time to re-apply.  Lasts a good month which is really good for this type of a product."
1675,189,3,We spray our vegetables with deer repellent.  Effective but expensive and washes off.We tried motion detection lights.  Worked for a weekWe tried motion detection sprinklers.  Worked but overwatered the garden.We have a five foot high electric fence around our garden.  The deer jump it.We tried the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.  Worked for a small area but we have a 1/4 acre garden.  We'd need hundreds of dollars worth of these things and the deer could still jump over them.
255,586,5,This has saved a few tomato plants from major droop.  I only applied once during last year and that was enough - but would depend on your soil.  I like organic when using on food products.  A little stinky.
1448,761,3,"Moles are not easy to get rid of. I knew one older homeowner who read she could get rid of moles in her yard by hooking a hose to her car's exhaust and sticking the hose down the mole hole, and running the car on idle for 'a while.'  Given that her yard was riddled with mole hill holes, she had her work cut out for her.  Her efforts didn't seem to make much of a dent on the mole population, but she did burn out the catalytic converter in her car.This trap does seem to be more practical and business like. Also more environmentally correct.  It's impressive.  If I were a mole I'd see this as a sort of guillotine for moles.  I'm setting it as soon as I see evidence of this year's mole population in my yard, but I can't help thinking this may have more flash than real effect.  Sort of like those bug zappers, which make a lot of sparks and zaps, but only really kill a tiny percentage of the bugs in their vicinity.  Perhaps if I catch a mole I should drape its carcass on the trap as a warning to other moles.  Rather like the smell of burnt bugs might just discourage other bugs from getting too close?  I am giving this trap 3 stars for the impression it creates. I'm deducting 2 stars because it is not exactly easy to set.  Let's hope it doesn't stab the neighborhood cats or dogs...."
746,821,5,"I live on a river which, it turns out, practically guarantees me a new supply of rodentia as soon as I get rid of the current critters. Am I an expert on mousetraps? Well, noooo but I sure have tried everything short of poison and shotguns.This one is a good as any and better than many. I am relieved that my musician's fingers can't get hurt by the mechanism and that the little traps are easy to set. And that the mice are easy to remove after, well um, you know. There seems to be no suffering caused which is important to me since I have little option but to protect my food supplies and sanity but still would hate to see an injured rodent linger. I had a big ol' Tomcat trap that once caught Three Little Micies in one bang. But that was shear dumb luck. This one is designed for such devastation."
533,167,3,"We live in a very residential looking neighborhood of homes on 10,000 square foot lots. That is, these are not zero lot line homes, but they aren't ""estates"" either. The ""forest"" where the deer are supposed to live is a good mile away. They still come trotting down the paved roads to gnaw at our garden. They eat our fruit off the trees, buds off the agapanthas, and destroy the vegetable garden if they can get to it. So, when I got a chance to review this product, I was happy to give it a go.The experience so far has been mixed. I read all the instructions, which are clear and concise. I then assembled the battery powered spray unit with the bottle of repellent. The sprayer comes with batteries already inside. At this point, you shake the bottle to mix the repellent, turn the trigger safety off and go to work; or at least that is what the instructions lead me to believe. In actuality, I had to spend time messing with the nozzle and the sprayer hose in order to get it to suck up some product and start spraying. Once this was done, it would reliably spray, but the mist was more like a splatter. Hopefully, this will not leave funny markings on the plants. I really played with the nozzle to get to a finer spray, but the unit always had a larger degree of splatter than I was happy with. It seems this would be due to the thickness of the repellent fluid, but that is just a guess.I sprayed our agapanthas and left the fruit and vegetables alone, relying on fencing for protection, because Deer Off works by leaving a coating on the plants you want to protect. The instructions, and common sense, advise against spraying Deer Off directly on your food. So far, so good, the agapantha buds (a particular delicacy to our deer), have not been harmed.Conclusion: I knocked off two stars because of the start up problems and the splattering. It is easy to use once set up and, like I said, no deer so far."
831,835,3,"I like my hostas and they are about the only decorative vegetation that will grow in our shady yard. So I wasn't pleased when some of my favorite hostas started disappearing from the ground up. We discovered that voles were the culprits. It has been an ongoing battle some years. I have tried granules and when I plant new hostas line the hole with sharp gravel. Quite frankly that seems to work best, but I was willing to try some liquid repellant and see what the results would be.This liquid version does not seem to last as long as the granular form or be as effective."
637,803,5,"Although my lawn is small, I decided to purchase an extra battery for my LST136 Black & Decker trimmer for when one of the batteries begins to have problems holding charge.  I like that the battery has a button that you can push to tell you the relative charge left in the battery.  I am able to trim my lawn after mowing and only use 25% of the battery's charge."
1183,334,4,"The COBRA 6000 PLANT SITTER works OK for what it is, however, the company didnt print the correct instructions for its use. You will NOT get any water moving into the watering stake, unless you syphon the water thru that hose. The instructions only mention filling up the stake with water. So, first fill up the water tank. DO NOT ADD ANY FERTILIZER. (You dont want to get that in your mouth.) Next, twist off the cap over the watering stake, and fill it up with water, RIGHT TO THE BRIM. Then, CAREFULLY put the cap back on. Now, SYPHON the water thru the hose, and when its flowing, then attach the hose to the plant stake. Place the plant stake as close to the roots as you can get it, without damaging them. Lastly, either hang the tank on the side of the planter, or place it ABOVE the plant's soil level, so you get good water flow. The hose's opening should ALWAYS be at the BOTTOM of the tank. The instructions remind you NEVER to let the tank run out of water, or let the water lever fall too low inside the watering stake. If you do, the syphoning suction will break down, and you'll have to initiate the syphoning process again.DOES THE COBRA 6000 WORK? Its OK, tho other self watering systems I've seen, use TWO of these watering stakes per planter. Unless you have a SMALL plant, just one stake wont moisten all the dirt in your planter, to the detriment of some of your roots. Also, the water tank is designed to attach to the side of a planter. However, its TOO BIG for that to work, unless you have at least a one gallon sized planter. It claims to water a plant UP TO 3 WEEKS. I guess they mean a cactus. I found the water tank to run out, after about 7-10 days.BEST METHOD FOR KEEPING YOUR PLANTS WATERED DURING VACATION.1. WATER THE PLANTS THOROUGHLY before you leave.2. COVER THE DIRT WITH WET PAPER TOWELS, or wet rags. Then, cover over the planter with a plastic bag. This will hold a LOT of water inside your planter. For outdoor plants, skip the plastic bag, cos you'll want to get whatever rain you can inside the planter.3. PLACE HUMIDITY TRAYS NEAR THE PLANTERS. Lack of humidity will cause extra evaperation thru the leaves.4. DONT PLACE IN DIRECT SUN. You'll want to get your plant to go almost into hibernation, while you're away.5. USE A WATERING SYSTEM LIKE COBRA 6000. I've seen people take a 1 liter plastic bottle, fill it with water, plug it with a rag, and place it upside down inside the planter. The water will slowly drain thru the dirt. This is good for BIG pots, and plants that like wet feet, like tropicals. The COBRA 6000 is a sophisticated version of that same method of watering, that works well for small planters.Overall, the COBRA 6000 works, but only on a smaller plant. If the plant is too big, the stake cant get water thru the WHOLE root system. Rememeber, to syphon the hose before use, make sure the opening is placed on the bottom of the tank. Also, keep the stake filled with water too. Best results were optained from placing the tank ABOVE the planter's rim, not hooked on the planter's side. If you place the water tank upon the rim, as the drawing on the cardboard container suggests, the weight of the filled tank might tip over the planter. Also, its less likely to work well, as the tank drains.Overall, a cheaper alternative to the more expensive, multi-pot watering systems. However, the vague, incomplete instructions, and the watering tank that's designed too large to hang on the planter's rim, might spoil this product for some."
1433,167,4,"I was very interested in the Deer Off product because we live in a very rural area and have deer ground hogs, chipmunks, and squirrels, both gray and red, around the house all the time. This isn't necessarily bad, unless they decide to get into the cellar or attic, or eat our plants.I ordered Deer Off to see what it would do. I was also interested in the battery powered sprayer. My first problem was that the Post Office failed to deliver the package. They thought it was leaking. (As far as I can tell, it wasn't. However, that made me wary.)  I followed the directions, shook up the container, inserted the hose for the sprayer, turned it on and nothing happened. I tried several times, still nothing. I cleaned the nozzle and the ball that's inserted in the container. Still nothing. Finally, I got a piece of wire to try to clear the blockage, still nothing. Then I noticed that there was no hole in the plastic plate that covered the hole where the liquid should come out. I punctured it and the sprayer started to work.On the positive side, the spray worked extremely well after I opened the hole. I was able to spray all around the house. Obviously, I will have to wait to determine whether it deters the critters.If the critters are discouraged by the product. I'll be thrilled. I am glad that I was able to make the sprayer work - makes you feel powerful!"
334,221,5,"I am so glad I added this to my pressure washer order.  This little guy made all the difference in the world cleaning our driveway.  It moved easy.  Like a pro floor buffer, if you have used one.  Glided over the concrete and cleaned so much faster than just using the pressure washer rod.  It does not  look like it is built to last, but while it last I will enjoy it."
1525,713,4,"These are pretty nice, they come preloaded with bait, they are resistant to being messed around with by children, and can kill multiple mice. Better than the poison packs which when they are chewed into can scatter the poison all around.They can kill up to 12 mice per block (and there are 8 total blocks), so ideally you could just throw this down and it should handle your mouse problem without having to keep resetting traps. Unfortunately they don't seem to like this food as much, but it's nice and convenient.  This one also has an advantage that once the block is used up you can open the top up and refill it (and it comes with extra).It says pet and dog resistant, and I would make sure that you still keep away from them, and use it in places where things like the poison throw packs would be used (since I think it's safer than that), but maybe not as safe as a conventional trap with peanut butter (but it is easier)."
1247,919,5,I have had a problem with birds wanting to build a nest on a stone archway over my front door for years! I had tried everything I could think of with very limited success and most things I used were  very unattractive. These spikes are not bad looking and they do keep the birds away but unfortunately &#34;my birds&#34; just moved to another spot. Don't get me wrong...I think these spikes are GREAT and the birds hate them. Just be prepared to use more spikes than you might expect because you'll have to put them in every possible roosting place the birds can find! Being made of plastic made it easy to trim them to fit in every possible nook and light enough in weight that I could glue them in place. I would highly recommend them for anyone who has pesky birds that just won't take no for an answer!
659,761,4,"It is very easy to use and since the spikes will only go off if the device is tripped from underneath, it is safe to use if you have pets. It seems weather proof as I have had it outside and with sprinklers and I have not seen any signs of rust.I have not however seen any results from the trap. I have not seen any mounds of dirt in the yard either so it is possible that the critters happen to not be active at the moment. Maybe they now know this is installed and waiting for them?  They were causing a lot of havoc and mess in the yard right before we set this up.I will have to wait and see how it performs once I see more activity. If you do keep it in on a lawn you have to remember to remove it to cut the grass.I am going to leave it armed and in place waiting to see how well it works. I am rating this 4 stars because it's very well made and sturdy and it was so  easy to set up.  If I find this works for us, it's a 5 star product for sure and I'll update the review and the rating."
1309,226,5,"These are very made and they do make my gardening much easier.Pros:Very comfortable handlesSmooth cutting actionIt is light so does not cause hand fatigueSolid build quality. Will last a very long time.No batteries or charging to worry aboutAfforableCons:It takes longer to trim the grass edging than the cordless electric trimmer.Summary:It may not be as fast as an electric trimmer, it does the job very well, quietly and efficiently."

412,853,3,"This planter box has a novel accordion shape and appears sturdy and well made, but the overall size is just too small.  It will only hold the tiniest of pots, 3"" diameter at the largest.  I don't have any pots that small, and I'm not sure what kind of plants you could keep in a pots that tiny.  Maybe miniature cactus or some seedlings?I also don't care for the rustic, unfinished wood that the planter is made from.  It looks weathered and old and does not complement the white window sills of my house.  The rustic look would work on my patio, but the small size would get lost among all my other plants.But the planter is just too interesting looking to discard.  I'm probably going to paint the box a bright, funky color and use it to hold crafts or office supplies.  It would be great for holding paper clips, post-it notes, push pins, etc."
652,906,5,How do you improve on something as simple as a garden hose? Well one thing is to include couplings that are easy to screw on and off. I waste more time trying to connect my hose than I do actually using it sometimes. And while no hose is truly &#34;kink free&#34; this is the best one I have seen so far. The hose armor protects the spigot end from kinking and from overzealous pulling. It is also drinking water sale for those hot days when only hose water will work.
402,844,3,"This mosquito repellent uses Linaloof to mask the scent of exhaled carbon dioxide so that Mosquitos can't zero in on you.  No Deet is listed in the ingredients. The unit is lightweight plastic, very easy to set up. I really like that it came with the four batteries needed to run the fan and light. The light is a soft glow, the fan is very quiet and should not disturb the peace on a summer night. The Cutter repellent cartridge is simple to use, just peel the lid and insert into the bottom of the lantern. One unit covers 64 sq. feet, so I will be ordering a few more for my deck. Cutter products have always worked for me, so I hope this one does the job. It is too soon to tell, as it is not yet warm enough for the swarms to come out.Well, the warm weather came and so did the Mosquitos. My grandson and I sat in the deck chairs with the unit on a table between us. Not  one foot away from each chair. I got two bites, he got eaten alive. had to downgrade rating from five to three stars."

73,248,5,"I really like these stakes as they keep the drip line where it supposed to be placed.  The cover fitted on the end of the tube (its the attachment seen to the left in the photo) supposedly keeps bugs out of the lines and since I've never see bugs, I have to assume they are working.  The attachment to the right in the photo keeps the tubing from slipping out of the top of the stake so they stay secure."
76,594,5,Well made just like all the other greenworks tools I own. You can't go wrong with this brand. Their 10 inch electric chainsaw is a beast. This thing is very well made. Looks like it'll easily last the next 20 years.
1292,306,5,I was out using this today. Millions of wasps under the boat tarp! With the executioner in one hand and a knife to cut the lined in the other I launched myself into the fray! I have seen a few knock offs of these but none of them look as nice or are built like a badminton racquet like this one. It ain't cheap and it does not look cheap.Robs report: Well worth the money. Have fun. Get it.
185,48,5,I much prefer snap connectors thought they tend to be overpriced.  Gardena is my favorite brand.  I usually remove the autostop valve inside.
474,951,5,"I received this item in exchange for an honest review. These are great tongs. They not only work great, but with the oak handles they are very attractive as well.  We threw some steaks on the grill tonight, and I couldn't have asked for a better performance. My favorite feature is the fact that they lock. Space is always at a premium when we grill so that is just great. They are heavy duty so there was no problem with the large cuts of meat. The stainless steel tips cleaned up easily as well. Try them!"
357,754,3,"There are some occasional mice scurrying around my properties so I decided to give this Nooski Mouse trap a try.Likes:>Very inventive trap design using an elastic ring that chokes little critters when they enter the plastic trap to get at the bait (peanut butter, cheese, or chocolate recommended by Nooski) and trip the triggering device.>Simple to set up and place along a wall or in a corner.Dislikes:>Fairly tiny trap considering I've occasionally seen a large rodent boldly running across the street around our hilltop suburban neighborhood.>Did kill a tiny 4"" mouse that was wandering around my backyard.>Didn't get the mole (moles?) that was digging multiple holes around my backyard lawn.>Kills more by suffocation compared to large old fashioned mouse traps that usually snaps a neck or spine in an instant.Overall:Even pests deserve a quick, painless demise.  This trap is way too small and movable for an 8"" large rodent that was seen digging a hole in the garage wall of my rental property.  I ended up using a large traditional spring-loaded trap baited with a sesame oil laced piece of meat tied securely to the trigger (rodents are smart, sneakily stealing baits from traps).  Snapped that big critter's back about 5 minutes after placing the trap by the hole.  Disposed of properly!"
34,320,5,This is some amazing stuff! It works fast and a great supplements for the garden. I'm never unhappy when I buy this product.
1675,501,5,"I live in the south so roaches are a part of our lives.I went to Home Depot to buy bug killer for the shop kitchen and found a multitude of choices, all with different ingredients.  The guy helping me said he'd tried many of them and found Bayer Advanced the most effective.  I'm familiar with the Bayer brand and use it in the garden.My brother sprayed around the baseboards at the shop kitchen and, as expected, had the floor littered with dead roach carcases the next morning.  Then he sprayed the baseboards in my house.  I hadn't seen any roaches lately so I was amazed to sweep up close to 24 dead roaches 24 hours later, another dozen a week later, and another dozen a week after that.  It's been over three weeks now and we haven't seen a live roach in either the house or the shop.This spray had a slight odor for a short period of time (totally gone by the time I got home from work) and didn't give me a headache as others have reported.  My brother also said it was easier to spray because it came out in a stream rather than a mist so he didn't worry about it drifting to countertops. My brother's a big strong man and he didn't have any problems with the handle breaking.  Possibly Bayer has a quality control issue and we just got a good squirter.Because of the grandchildren, I use the poison-free killers most of the time and only when I see a roach.  I won't use this bug killer inside routinely but I will definitely buy it for the shop and will use it on baseboards a couple of weeks before family visits."
177,701,5,"I have used Terro for years.  Not these great traps but just out of the bottle.  While it works good it is messy.  No matter where I put it something gets stuck in it, or set on it.  With these prebaited stations this is no longer a concern.  These work especially well near my sons bee hives when they were having an ant problem.  The ants get in but not the bees.  Highly recommend."
296,911,4,I used this to paint my wood outside chairs.  With the slats they are not fun to paint with a brush to say the least.  I used this little guy and it was so much easier.  I put the paint directly in the canister and started painting away.  It worked like a dream to get in-between boards and underneath.  I will definitely be using this for the harder projects.
54,550,5,"Late Summer brought out the little buggers in spades. Does fly paper work on fruit flies? I think it does, but nobody likes to have those nasty, curly killing fields hanging all over the joint. This little bugger worked like a charm, just put it up on top of the fridge where I keep my bananas and other fresh fruit, and within a day or two the only fruit flies I could find in the house were at the bottom of this liquidy grave. Highly recommended."
503,394,5,"I was a little worried about the small size of this grill. But I wanted to downsize from the huge four burner gas grill that I had. I found that the size of the Weber 200 was just right.The Weber 200 was very easy to assemble. I only had to install the lid with two pegs and pins and the handle. I placed a small propane bottle on the regulator and turned on the grill. I allowed the grill to heat up for the suggested 10 minutes. I grilled chicken thighs. I was pleased with the heavy grill grate and the temperature that the grill maintained. The chicken cooked evenly and had those wonderful grill marks.I think this grill would also do great for cooking a roast or whole chicken. Once the lid is closed, the temp stays very hot, even on a low setting. I will try different recipies using the grill since I believe roasting is possible with this Weber.Another nice thing is the portability of the grill. It is fairly lightweight. It would be great for a picnic or tailgating.So far, I am happy with this purchase. I would rate it a 10!"
560,56,5,"I've been using this brand of fly trap for about 5  years now and it's never disappointed me. It will catch all the nasty types of flies you normally find during the summer time. This is perfect for pet owners like myself, in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I don't see it, which can atrack flies.A couple of things you should know about this product:First, it will probably not catch any flies the first day, and let me explain why, the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day, at which type, a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap, which means it is now working. After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down. It works."
549,276,5,"Our No/No Bronze Five Tier Bird Feeder is a hit with the birds and looks like it will be around a long time. The accordion style, all medal construction make a really innovative design compared to other feeders we have owned. Our feeder hangs from a long, curved pole that extends out from our balcony and, so far, the squirrels seem only able to look at it from below and scavenge the occasional dropped seed. My only issues with the feeder were with filling it with seeds. Both issues are easy to overcome: One, it is infinitely easier to fill it once it is hanging. Two, using a scoop (like those for dry dog food) majorly reduces spillage. We bought a 20-Pound bag of Wagner's Four Season Oil Sunflower Seed and are already on a second fill in less than a week. I'm ordering a second feeder. That's how happy I am with the No/No Bronze Five Tier Bird Feeder."
1592,189,3,"I live in a rural area and have lots of deer but so far I have not been able to catch the deer messing with my ""Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent."" I wanted to take a video but so far nothing. So I can't comment if it works but I can give a preliminary review.There are four catagories listed by the manufacturer.1. Very Effective: Suburban area. Deer density is low. Damage is mild, infrequent, unpredictable.2. Effective: Suburban area. Deer density is medium. Damage is moderate, frequent, predictable.3. Effective (if you move the unit around to the deer's pattern): Rural residential area. Deer density is medium to high. Damage is extensive, frequent, predictable.4. Not Effective: Rural. Agriculture area. Deer density is high. Damage is extreme, frequent, unpredictable.Three posts come in the box. The ground spikes are plastic as is the battery compartment on top. Everything snaps together well and seems to be well-made. However I'm not sure plastic spikes are going to hold up for very long. There are small wires on top that are battery charged to shock the deer. The cotton ball with the acorn scent goes inside a plastic ""tube"" under the metal wires. Is it enough of a jolt to keep the deer away? I don't know because I'm stupid enough to try it.If I can capture some video of the deer investigating the deer repellent unit I will post it but until then only time will tell if this works."
786,318,3,"This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly."
702,455,5,This is a great product - its big enough to where you can put some muscle behind it.. and the water works better than I would have thought.. I've already ordered another as a gift.  Highly recommended!
307,876,4,"I used to use the smaller handle brushes for the grill. Thankfully, I was sent one of these at no cost in exchange for  an honest review. The log handle is surely a nice change for the heat hitting my hands over the burners. The handle also goes almost all the way to the top which gives it more support and you can use more force while scrubbing. Very nicely made brush. I would recommend for the price."
904,910,5,"This is my first fire pit I have ever owner. I have been using a homemade hole in the ground with rocks around the last few years. This was very easy to put together. The instructions are easy to follow and I love how deep it is, it easily burns normal wood we buy locally here in New Mexico.When it heats up it gets REALLY hot.. Made the mistake of leaning up on it and got a pretty bad burn. But that was my fault, and a normal precaution with these steel pits. It came with a cover, but its pretty cheaply made. I can't imagine it lasting that long.Very happy again with this steel fire pit. Its very attractive and makes my back yard look much classier then a hole in the ground!"
424,699,2,"I thought the warning label on this said safe around kids and pets. It looks like it is a trap that has bait inside it and the mouse is supposed to eat it inside the trap and die there. Well, that's not the case, they eat the poison in the trap and then can leave and go anywhere.  I'm afraid to use this and kill off my dog, who definitely likes to eat mice when she can find them. So, it IS an issue if you have pets who might eat the poisoned mouse. I'm not willing to risk it. This also poses a risk to wild animals, if the mouse should wander outside to die and a bird eats it. Honestly, saying the trap is kid-safe and pet safe leads you to believe that you won't have to worry about anything eating poison other than the rodent -- which isn't the case."
1197,751,5,"Even though I don't live in the country, ""critters"" seem to find their way into my yard.  Over the years, I've seen a couple opossums in my yard.  I wouldn't worry about them, but I have a dog.  I know that it wouldn't be an issue if my dog would leave it alone (they aren't creatures to search out trouble), but it is extremely difficult to get a dog to NOT go directly to a strange animal and start barking like a maniac.  In the past I borrowed someone's live trap and caught an opossum.  I'll admit it -- I was too scared to pick up the cage with it inside.  There just didn't seem to be protection (distance) from my fingers to the animal, so I had someone get it for me.  However, the Havahart 1064 trap takes away that fear with the double doors and space on the upper corners where the animal can't reach.  I personally think all of these traps can be a bit tricky to set, but it's pretty easy to figure out with a little bit of thought."
265,810,4,"My problem is with squirrels and gophers. The strategy with this product is to soak the ground with an unpleasant taste in an effort to repel tunneling pests. In terms of gophers, so far, it seems to have worked. I had a problem with gophers tunneling under my sidewalk then pushing the dirt out in to my flowerbed. The sidewalk section is covered with pavers, so there were enough cracks for this spray to penetrate. I thoroughly soaked the entire sidewalk area and I have not seen any gopher holes since. I hope it works.Squirrels are another issue. Their tunnels tend to go deeper into the ground, so the castor oil in this product doesn't affect much of what they do. But, from my understanding, what you try to accomplish is you spray the whole area around where they search for food and you hope they go away because the food is unpleasant. In addition to spraying, I soaked nuts and sunflower seeds in some of the solution right out of the bottle and spread them over a wide area. I can't say this method has worked as well. The squirrels are still there, but there seems to be fewer and they have at least moved their ground entrances, so I know something is bugging them.At any rate, I think you need to use everything in your arsenal to get rid of pests and this product would certainly be worth a try."
304,870,5,"We have been  using this Spa Enzymes product in our hot tub for about two months now, and I have to say it really has made a huge difference in the quality of water in our hot tub. I have seen a noticeable difference in the quality of water - it not only smells cleaner, but it FEELS cleaner, if that makes sense. We have used Enzyme products before, but often the product is perfumed and just adds one more unnatural smell to the water. With the ORB-3 product, the water simply smells FRESH, which is a good thing.I have also noticed that we are using less chlorine in the spa, which I really appreciate because my 8 year old grandson often uses the hot tub and I've always hated how red his eyes are when he comes out. Not as much since we've been using the Spa Enzymes product.Overall, I'm very pleased and will continue to purchase this product."
294,776,4,"This battery operated electric deterent is easy to set-up and does the trick for a small garden area.We have a small garden and a small, energetic puppy that needs the great outdoors and needs to chew and dig.  The garden entices him for it's great smells, taste and soft dark dirt for digging.  Usually, after digging up my plants, he figures he might as well take a leak or dump on them as well.There's a hundred feet of wire and 4 D batteries included.  Simply follow the steps:1. Energizer on stake into ground 2, stick in the short posts 3. string wire 4. attach wire to energizer 5. Turn on.  There's also a little warning sign and a power tester.They warn to turn the thing off on dry, brush fire kind of days, keep away from combustables(Duh), and to stick with the plan, i.e., don't alter the design.It produces a mild shock; works for our dog and cats.  I'm used to the wire we used for the horses.  It states good for skunks , rabbits, raccoons- I don't know about racoons?  They can be pretty ornery and determined.Overall, a simple unit to install, no problems.  A bit pricey but convenient."
72,788,4,"I have been feeding birds a very long time. I've used different feeders - I had one feeder that the squirrels managed to get into and and stay until every seed was eaten. It doesn't appear the squirrels can get into this feeder.It's a cute feeder, but I'm not sure how tough it is. The feeder has glass sides and I am a little concerned about possibly breaking the glass. Or having some inclement weather cause the glass to break (powerful winds could knock it down or cause something to hit the glass). But so far it has survived me, so that's good.It's easy to install and easy to take care of. I'm not sure of the birds' response to the feeder yet as it's only been up one day. I think the smaller birds will really like it, it seems geared to smaller birds. But don't worry, the bigger birds won't go starve - I have another feeding station set up.I do recommend this feeder, especially if you have many small birds to feed. It's just I'm not too fond of the glass sides._enjoy_"
1170,565,4,Love the llok and its sturdy however it wont hold on my balcony banister in any position due to the securing legs. It wont work for me because I was going to place an 18&#34; plant holder inside with a bamboo plant inside that has grown to almost 3 feet and it wont support the item. That said im sure it would hold a smaller tree or for use with a different balcony banister.
384,699,3,"This version has four different bait stations which can be used in various locations at your home.I am giving this three stars - Bromethalin is an effective mouse toxin. The problem is that it is also toxic to dogs and extremely toxic to cats. So, while my dogs have ignored the bait stations, I am still picking them up during the day when I'm not at home. There is no test and no antidote to this poison, once it is consumed, you have fifteen minutes to make your pet vomit it out. After that, there is little that can be done.If you decide to use this, please make sure that you make certain not only that your pets (especially cats) do not attempt to eat the dead rodents.I suggest before you try this you consider a non-poison alternative in your home. By mixing flour, baking soda, and sugar (equal proportions) you can make a substance that may get rid of your mouse (or rat) problem. Set the dry mix down in something you will later throw away where you have seen mice. The baking soda reacts with the stomach acid of the rodent and creates gas, which the rodent can't pass. Eventually this substance will cause a blockage or rupture the colon killing the mouse.An effective choice ... but even in &#34;pet safe&#34; containers, not 100% safe. Keep away from pets and children."
1385,149,4,"18 months ago I was up on an 8' ladder trimming branches. The ladder legs bent, I fell 5' to the ground. I won't go into the details but I'm still recovering from the fall. The old ladder is in the garbage dump and I have a new, stronger, ladder. But I still don't want to go up a ladder unless I really have to.I bought this pole chain saw to augment the four 18V Black & Decker tools I already have, and to reduce the number of times I must climb a ladder. I assembled it in two minutes, was able to trim branches from the ground. It worked easily, cut easily, and disassembled easily for storage in the bag provided.I really like these 18V tools from B&D.; I also have a B&D; 36V lawn mower. No more gas, no more electric cords, no more spark plugs, and no more oil. I can mow & edge two lawns, and blow off the sidewalks and driveway in 20 minutes.I think this is a great addition to my B&D; collection.By the way I've been using the B&D; tools for two years. I keep all the batteries on the charger 100% of the time when they are not in use. I haven't had to replace a battery yet, and they all seem to hold a charge as well as they did when new."
1400,387,5,"This is a simple, great invention.  The coals burn hotter, faster than with lighter fluid.  I use two pieces of old news paper and they will light charcoal in 15 - 20 minutes.  If you use charcoal, give your neighbors your old lighter fluid and buy one of these."
1104,139,5,"I hooked these up to all my garden hose attachments so I could put a quick connect on my hose. Before the quick connect I put on this brass shut off valve. Now I dont have to run 100 feet to turn off the water, or kink the hose to switch attachments.. I love it"
362,526,5,"This is a well-thought-out series of feeders. The base separates into two halves for easy cleaning, and the hanger at the top is nice and secure.This particular model -- the green antique bottle -- has a 10-ounce capacity. The bottle is specially made for the feeder -- it isn't really an antique. It has little hummingbirds and the Perky Pet name embossed in it.The bottom part of the base is plastic. The top part is metal, with candy apple red feeding port flowers. The base is flat on the bottom so you can easily stand the feeder during cleaning.The proof of the good design is in the ""flip"" -- that point after refilling that you turn the feeder over for hanging. Not a drop of nectar spills when I flip mine. Other feeders spill a lot. Not this one.So do the hummers like it? You bet they do. I suspect there's an advantage to a glass reservoir that appeals to hummers -- less plastic taste or smell.I'm hoping the metal part of the base has a good coat of clear lacquer on it to keep it from rusting. I'm making sure to use a soft sponge for washing it so I don't accidentally scrub off any clear coat.Love this series of feeders! I hope they last years!"
1365,747,3,"Okay, but only for light jobs I use it to keep the steps and sidewalks clean.It is much easier than sweeping.The battery is the same kind I have from my weed trimmer, so I have 3 bats in totalThe ones from the trimmer are great and hold a charge for enough time to do a large block 1/2 hr of property (in NY ) but the one that came with this unit is a bust.If I did not have the other bats I would send it back.The unit is quiet but effective but a little disappointing.However,I am keeping it for light jobs.I wonder if it will blow away some light snow? I hate shoveling snow."
850,38,3,"so, I was trying to save some money and avoid buying an electric or gas powered de-thatching rake/power rake.  I thought this would be a good idea, and I will say, it works as designed but it is HARD work.  Now, this being said, my lawn has a pretty thick layer of thatch because I have a mulching, push mower.  I don't bag for multiple reasons, but bottom line, I needed a way to thicken my grass up.  The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.  It might be meant to do it like this, but I typically don't read directions.Its ok, nothing great, nothing horrible.  I will say the quality seems good, it's got a solid wood handle, and I think it will last longer than I'll even care to use it.  I suppose, in a pinch, you could swing this thing around and do some damage to zombies.  however, I would prefer a piercing/slicing weapon for zombie battles, for obvious reasons."
934,291,5,Very sturdy injector.  All metal and no plastic parts!  Easy to clean and use.  I store it in a regular sized ziplock sandwich bag.  Exploded some chicken skin on the first try but it is easy to get the hang of.  Really helps the flavor of chicken when injecting herbs and seasonings under the skin.  Great to use while smoking meats too!  I had no doubt this will last for years to come.  I wouldn't roast a chicken again with out.
277,944,4,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of a fairly sedentary woman (i.e. not strong). Overall, I really liked the Black & Decker Corded Mower with Edge Max. It's quiet, easy to push and mows neatly. I got this mower out of the box, assembled--and mowed my entire front yard--within an hour!When I first opened the box, I was horrified--it looked like nothing was put together. I slowly began to assemble the grass catcher, and voila, I was able to lift the (assembled) mower out of the box WITH ONE HAND! It's quite light. Once the grass catcher is assembled, the rest goes pretty fast.However, while assembling the mower, I was disgusted with Black & Decker for their low standards: pieces that should have snapped together relatively easily took so much strength because of misaligned parts. They're like the opposite of LEGOs--pieces do *not* fit like a glove. In face, I needed a butter knife to help me push pieces together--more than once. I had to do both butt & chest presses on the grass catcher to have a couple of pieces finally snap into place. Thank goodness I did this in the privacy of my living room. I was sweating because of so much physical exertion (not the worst thing, mind you) to get that grass catcher put together correctly. Seriously, B&D;: Try Harder!Keep in mind: this does not come with a extension cord, so if you want to mow immediately, make sure you have a long one ready.The mower is so easy to push and control. I have used both gas power mowers and push mowers. This electric mower was the most pleasant mowing experience for me by far. The power one is hard for me to keep up with, and weights about as much as me. The push mower I used, a Fiskars mowers, was entirely abysmal: very hard to push and left your lawn looking like a terrible haircut.The one caveat I have is this: cords are a pain! Not just on this mower, but on all corded mowers. If I had the means, I'd totally buy an electric mower run on a battery. But for this low price, if you have the patience for a cord, this is a total deal. Drape the cord over your shoulder and not around your neck. Live and learn."
611,420,5,"Squirrels could not get up to the birdfeeder by climbing the pole!  I'm impressed, amazed and amused.  Just make sure you have it more than 8 feet away from a tree or other device. Squirrels can jump onto a feeder from the top or sides, just not from the pole it's on, climbing upward.  It seems to baffle them!"
1269,43,3,I gave these only three stars because of how they do and feel in your hand.  They will slip in your hand because there a bit slick and hard to hold.  There ok for small cuts and not having to use them a lot at one time.I wouldn't buy these if i had it to do over again.
949,795,5,"This is my third Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder and they are all well-constructed and they all attract a lot of hummingbirds. This model has some nice enhancements over my earlier models. It's very easy to fill through the wide, top opening.  No more need to fill and invert!  And if you've ever had a feeder attacked by ants you'll love the built-in ant moat.  Finally, with the wide opening on the top and the removable feeding ports this model is very easy to keep clean.  All-in-all a great product!"
245,684,5,"Maybe it's too early to write a review on something I have used only twice...But so far this thermometer works great for me, and as mentioned before it takes a lot of the guessing work out and constantly going out to check temperature or coals. It took me a long time at first to adjust air flow and chimney settings because I kept going out to re adjust smoke flow, closing and opening vents... but after a while I caught on, and was able to relax and smoke a slow cook chicken and rib tips on a offset smoker... shows the correct temp, and I like setting the alarms for temps too high or low... all these years I never knew of a device that could make a barbeque so much easier and enjoyable... I highly recommend this."
1008,365,5,"May 19, 2011:  UPDATE.  It's time to get the Recliner out and go for a third season of use.  Without exception this chair looks almost exactly as it looked in 2009 when it arrived.  Two seasons of use and it's still like new.  After sun, rain and lots of wind I am delighted with the Strathwood.Do not use this if you have work to do.  If you have the slightest bit of sleep in your system and relax in this recliner you are going to go to sleep.  I set this up on the deck with the intention of reading a while and then finishing some other tasks related to spring cleanup.  Whoops.  Some fairy sprinkled sleep dust in my eyes and away I went.  Thank goodness our street is populated by a pack of fools driving Harleys who believe they can take the curve out front at 50 MPH in 2nd gear.  I don't know about anti-gravity but the recliner-chair is really comfortable.This recliner is one of those items that far exceed expectations.  Having been an ally of old fashioned cheap recliners I was taken aback with the quality and weight of this recliner.  It is heavy enough not to get blown away with a breeze or even a strong wind.  Unlike the old fashioned cheap ones it will hold with ease those of us who have managed to exceed normal weight limits.  You'll have to determine those limits.  It holds Blubba and me with ease.  Not both of us together.  Just one or the other.  Maybe both.  Later.  March 26 update:  It is later now and I forgot to include a comment about the included pillow.  I was so excited to try out the recliner I forgot to empty the full contents of the packing box.  Lo and behold the pillow was there and it sure adds a nice touch to an already nice recliner.  Please permit one other comment.  The craftsmanship for the recliner is perfect:  not rough edges or annoying sharp edges.  It's well made.  Can't use now:  too rainy.  Later"
954,449,4,"This does NOT control or get rid of moths.  According to the package, this only attracts male moths and does nothing to control the females nor the larvae that actually destroy clothing.  If you catch males, you know you got a problem...do something else about it.  If you already KNOW you have a problem, this is a wasted step.Easy to set up.  Assembly involves opening a packet and dropping a little square piece of pheromone  impregnated plastic onto the sticky surface inside of the cardboard trap.  Voila.I have these in my closets and so far, no moths caught. But I don't believe that I had a problem to begin with and now feel better knowing.  I will keep an eye on these and update."

697,493,2,"The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice. You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait. These traps will only work with small mice, and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they don't die right away. The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside. Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future, similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold. These are safer than other traps if you have kids around, but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint. I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use, and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years."
1261,229,3,"I understand why many like this and many don't.  Havahart is asking you to throw down a lot of loot for what amounts to something that smells like mace (the spice) and nutmeg and cloves (or whatever) all mixed together into a small container.  While spices aren't cheap, their potencies will fade with time (compare freshly ground pepper with the pre-ground stuff), so that's why some are outcrying that the stuff only lasts a month, etc.  I found the product worked best in conjunction with other pest control measures.  We were getting an opossum or two in our crawlspace (under the bathtub) along with accompanying fleas, so I crawled under the house for several hours (not fun) and sealed up a bunch of areas with flexible latticework, patio tiles, a staple gun, Great Stuff Pestblock Insulating Foam Sealant (Dow Product 11000714 ""Great Stuff"" Pestblock Foam Sealant - 12 Oz Can Gray (Pack of 8) and the Havahart Critter Ridder Animal Repellent.  Bottom line is that you either need to use 100 pounds of this stuff and reapply it often (after rain, perhaps) OR you need to use it in conjunction with other pest control measures.  If you want to go with the former option, dumping vinegar, bleach and/or freshly ground black (or cayenne!) pepper might be just as effective and less expensive."
659,229,4,"Earlier this summer, we updated our front yard.  We put in new flowering plants and covered the dirt with special paper to help deter the weeds from growing.  On top of the paper, we laid down black mulch.  It looks so nice!  The beautiful effect to the whole front of the house is huge.  We're so happy.But, then we started getting cats pooping in our mulch!  GROSS!!  Yuck...  They would come and mess up the mulch and do their thing.  Then we'd have to clean it up.  Not nice.We used the Critter Ridder on half the area.  On the other half we sprayed vinegar.  Both areas have not had any 'kitty gifts' since we applied both products.  The one big difference between the areas: the cats still come and move the mulch around in the vinegar area.  No poop, but they still make a mess for us to clean up.  Drives me batty.This product works great for what we need it for.  It's a 5 star product for us, but I took away a star because it's so darn expensive!  But, it works."
1261,737,4,"Like some other customers, I had my doubts about the WORX WG782 mower but, like those same customers, I came away pleasantly surprised and satisfied.  With my old gas push mowers, it usually took about 20 minutes to cut my St. Augustine-grass lawn in the front and back yards.  With the much narrower WORX, it takes an extra ten minutes, tops.  Those minutes, however, are quiet and fairly effortless due to the WORX electric motor and light weight.I live in a downtown home that doesn't have a lot of storage space, so the WORX works for me in that regard.  Even with the battery installed (you can easily remove it for charging), the mower is easy to pick up.  (With the battery out, it's a virtual breeze.)Although the mower came with a bagging attachment, I found that the mower mulches just fine and therefore don't use the bag.  After each use, I fold up the mower handle, which is a simple matter due to four easy-release hinges.  I've used it three or four times now without any issues."
1277,260,4,"The bait seems to work fine on one of Tomcat's mechanical snap traps, and had me catching mice shortly after deploying the traps. I'm not sure it's any more effective than peanut butter, which I've also used successfully in the past. It's a bit easier (quicker and cleaner) to get on the trap, but you can sure get peanut butter a lot less expensively."
1204,167,4,"We've had continual issues with deer, rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers, vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers, several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled, with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side, the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note, the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking, but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks, don't waist your time."
125,754,1,"Number one, I don't like how in humane this is. Since the mouse ran across the entire room, 14 feet, after it got the ring on it's neck it was obvious it did not die instantly and then I still had to pick it up to throw away so nasty that way too. The whole thing is also too expensive if you have a lot of mice. I still say the old wood trap is just as good and cheaper than anything else out there and you can reuse it over and over. I just pick the end of the trap up with that so I don't need to touch the dead mouse to open it and drop it in the garbage. Much more sanitary. Also, I had a hard time getting this crazy thing put together with the ring on after the one that came already installed was used. Anyone with big hands and fingers,or weak hands and fingers, will find it almost impossible to get it set again. Just go buy the old wood traps, they never let you down and are cheap and seem to never wear out. I have one that is about 30 years old and works as well now as the day I bought it and.... I never need to buy anything extra to make it work. They may try to make it look like it is hard to use but that's just negative advertising. Like anything else, once you've set it a few times it's a breeze."
580,513,4,"The Mosquito Magnet is a very specific solution to a very specific problem.  You have to have 1) Ownership of a fairly large area of land 2) A particularly nasty mosquito problem 3) Enough money that you don't mind spending a tidy sum to combat those mosquitoes.  If you have all three of those you are going to love this.There is no doubt that the Mosquito Magnet works, and works well.  It works amazingly well, one might even say.  It works on the principle of simulating human breath that attracts the mosquitoes into a trap, a trap that fills up quickly.  It isn't an instant solution; you have to leave it running constantly for about a week before you start to see the results, but from then on out your mosquito problem becomes a non-problem.The magnet comes in a huge box, and is easy enough to set up and get started.  It isn't quite the same size as my small propane grill, but it isn't far off. It requires a newish propane tank to run, which you will have to buy if you don't already own one. Once you get it up and turned on, it runs without any further need for fine-tuning. You just start it up and let it go, then check the traps a week later.  I haven't had mine too long, but I have heard that they tend to burn out after a year, which is something to keep in mind.Ultimately for me I don't have the right confluence of circumstances to need the Mosquito Magnet.  My main mosquito problem comes with regular week-long camping trips in the summer near a river that has a particularly unpleasant mosquito bog.  But because the Magnet doesn't provide an instant solution, and needs to be run continuously for a week before you really see results, it doesn't help like I was hoping.  In my own backyard in the Pacific Northwest I get mosquitoes, and it was nice to be mosquito-free for awhile, but I don't really have enough of a problem to justify the propane-usage required to run the Mosquito Magnet constantly."
1314,498,5,Cant beat this thing for the money when compared to how much it can hold and how well it holds the temps.  I just wish they sold some kind of cheap disposable liner for the drip tray as its nasty to clean after every cook.
865,126,5,"A few weeks ago we helped my mother clean her garage and came across two of these feeders, both brand new and in their original boxes. Mom did not want them, so we gave one to a neighbor and brought the other one home.Nothing happened for the first few days... we were initially a bit disappointed. Then, after two more days we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit. Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started!  As week #2 of our feeder experience got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day.Guess the word got out!Now, in the middle of the fourth week the feeder is emptying every 2.5 days or so.  We have wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this feeder, flying in to land on a perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off.Highly recommended!  Totally fascinating."
20,828,5,"I have various motion-sensing watering devices and they all work well.  This one works well and is built well.  And it seems to be able to hit up to 40' away, farther than my other two devices made by two other companies, and as advertised.I placed this device near my strawberry patch, the last place in my garden that the dogs haven't yet dug up.  While my younger shepherd is persistent at digging, this device does shoo her away.  She loves water, but she doesn't like it sprayed at her in a loud fashion.I can't speak for deer or elk since we don't have those in our 'hood, but it definitely keeps dogs and cats out of the area."
1247,869,3,This may be scaring away a few animals but not many. The deer seem to get used to it fairly quickly and some actually seem to enjoy it! I don't hear the sound they refer to and I suspect neither do the animals. The reservoir seems to always be empty and I am wondering if even swooping birds are setting it off. Setting the sensitivity is a very inexact process . All in all I cannot recommend this to anyone with a real varmint problem in their yard because it is an expensive repellent that only repels for a short while. I'm thinking about putting soap and towels out beside it in hot weather so the deer can make the best use of it!

1257,902,3,"With a modern twist on an old idea, the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel does the job very well and looks great on a modern patio.WHAT I LIKE:The sturdy plastic resin seems like it would go through any deep freeze and come out OK. It's been below freezing here, but not the temps we normally get around the first of February, so I have yet to see if this is a fact, but I have no doubts it will do fine as my other one is not nearly as sturdy and has gone through 5 winters so far.The design is nice and will go with my modern patio area very nicely. I have a concrete wall on each side and the color will blend in very well. I like the wavy texture on the barrel, very modern and very now.The two spigots levels are great and I'll probably never use the higher one.Holds 50 gallons, that's a lot of watering if you have a small yard or a few potted plants.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:The top design is really odd in my opinion. You would never be able to really put a real plant in this tub design as it would get washed out, especially if you have a large roof with a lot of watershed. I fill up my other 50 gal. bucket in one short rain storm, so I know this is not going to be a place for real plants to hang out. Probably will get a fake one and simply weight it down in there.I don't like the allowance for a hook-up to the downspout. This should be universal and allow for the spout to go directly into the top loosely instead of resting on top of the screen.  The screen situation is nice, but sort of unnecessary in my book, I don't get that much stuff in the gutter. Now, that said, since this would be nearly impossible to clean out (why is there no removable top on this design?) I can see why they want a screen screwed in place.Given the amount of rain we've had, mine is full already but was somewhat problematic to hook up.Great design look, poor design functionality.  Form follows function, so perhaps this design should go back for a re-work."
121,81,3,"I have a black thumb. I can kill just about any plant known to man (including cactus during a drought). Since I've had little success with growing anything edible in the garden, I figured I'd give composting a shot, with the hope of livening up my roses (the one thing I can grow because I pretty much leave them alone except for pruning the bushes a couple times a year).I started my compost pile about a month ago, and I have to say, it's been fairly successful. It definitely has the strong, ""earthy"" scent one expects from rotting fruits, veggies, and garden cuttings. It's definitely doing something to the stuff I've been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don't know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don't know. What I will say, though, is that I don't see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you're new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don't leave anything that's too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I've got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don't know if it's because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I've got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I'm not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I've got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I'm looking forward to doing an update then."

1188,466,5,"I hesitate to write an over the top gushing review because you might think I work for Pivotrim. I do not. I did not buy my Pivotrim on Amazon either. I just came hear to write a review that I hope influences you to make a smart decision.Four weeks ago I bought a Poulon bump-n-go 2 cycle gas trimmer and after the very first use I was really ready to just toss it in the garbage. Bump-n-go my butt.Today I installed a Pivotrim head. Took me eight minutes. Should have taken three minutes, but I was too macho to read the directions and be reminded that the bolt on the Poulon might be counter-threaded. Once I had that figured out I was in business. I trimmed all of my yard and most of the empty lot next door.I was actually trying to see if I could break the line! Finally succeeded when I got into some bamboo and small loose tree branches.I bought my Pivotrim in a store. I paid $20. No shipping, no handling. I love my Pivotrim and it saved my Poulon gas trimmer from the junk pile.You do not need to buy Pivotrim extra string. I have a big reel of string that I bought for $4. I'll just cut some to the right length and stick'em in my back pocket when I am trimming. I really does only take five seconds to load a fresh string."

1604,450,5,"So far I am really impressed by the quality of this brush. The handle seems pretty typical for this type of product, but the nylon bristles are very good. They are stiffer than the cheap Walmart plastic ones, which helps get into the crevices of my Pebbletec pool coating. And, I scrubbed vigorously at the pool and tile with it, and NO bristles broke off like the cheap Walmart ones do.I'll try to remember to update after a summer in the sun, but I don't anticipate it breaking down nearly as fast. But even if it eventually does, it's worth the extra $3 on it over the Walmart version.----Update June 2014: I've had this brush for two years and the bristles are still in good condition with almost no shedding, and the metal hasn't bent or warped (and I leave it outside year round). I did replace the retainer clips but those are only a few bucks at a pool store."
943,930,5,"I've used a similar product for years, and was happy enough with them. I never realized how much better they could be until I tried ReLeaf Leaf Scoops. The other scoops that I used were round with jagged teeth on one edge, and they were kind of flat. They couldn't pick up large amounts of leaves or clippings at once, and small items fell out before making it to the bag, but they were still easier than just using my hands. ReLeaf Leaf Scoops are much larger, and they are cupped to hold a lot of material at once. The handles are easy to grip, and they are designed to help grasp my hands so they are easier to hold onto. I hold the inner handle, and the outer handle holds the back of my hands.  I tried them with and without gloves, and found that they feel better when I use gloves. They pick up everything from large leaves to fine mulch and hold it well until it reaches the target. I was offered a pair of scoops free for an unbiased review, and I'm glad that I have so many good things to say about them. They really made my spring cleanup easier and I'm sure they will work just as well this fall. Oh, they also came in a drawstring bag for storage, which was a nice touch."
1592,865,2,".. I would never have paid twenty bucks for a charger head with no cable. Thankfully the cable comes with the Kindle ereader. Yes it's nice, it works well and and it comes in an attractive box but it should have been included with the device or cost maybe five bucks. Do not buy this charger unless it is a gift and you need to keep yourself from looking cheap. My wife usually doesn't care about such things but I'm not going to risk it this time. Birthdays are important to her.Not recommended.  Get an aftermarket that costs much much less."
1491,351,3,"[Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET."
619,722,4,"The spin on the 11.5 Garden Genius Pot Filler sounds great and it's reuseable. I now have it in the pot and have planted some flowers. Seems good at this point. It helps with drainage so you don't have to put stones or gravel in the bottom of the pot. The planter is now lighter and easy to move around. Of course, when watered, it can still leak from the bottom so you do need a drain saucer beneath it. I especially like the fact that I can hose it off after the season ends and use it again."

1205,925,4,"This item works like an automatic dog or cat waterer.  As the tray is depleted, the bottle releases just enough water to fill it back up.  This is accomplished by atmospheric pressure, but if that makes your head hurt, know that it is dependable and works well.  It is not very effective in drawing birds where I live, as there is a lot of water on our farm, so they just go to the creeks, ponds, and springs.  If you live in a dryer area, this should work wonders for you.  I put this one in my sister's yard as she is a dedicated birder and it draws a greater variety of birds than her feeders alone."
1265,574,5,"The birds love it - bluejays, chickadees, finches.  It is the most popular of 3 different types of birdfeeders I have.  Unfortunately, a squirrel, has taken a liking to it, but that's not the feeder's fault."

985,513,5,When Vine sent me this to try out I have to admit I was a skeptic.  When it arrived even more so.Took it on a week long camping trip in a place where there were TONS of mosquitos.Now whether it was this contraption or just plain luck I did not get on mosquito bite.  The bin was full of mosquitos at the end of the week.  Intially it did not look like the trap was cataching them right but when I went to actually empty the trap it was clear that it had worked correctly.The DVD that comes with it while it has some good information takes too long to actually get to the point and is very poor quality.While this appears more designed for seasonal use as opposed to event use it does seem to have an impact even in a short amount of time.
1049,869,3,"I initially wrote a glowing review about the Havahart Spray Away Elite II because its range (50 ft) and spray distance (25 ft) matched my area coverage needs and everything worked well for awhile. Now the solar battery light (indicating low levels) comes on a lot, and it does not spray water until there is enough charge.  Days can pass before operation resumes.The device is placed in the sunniest possible spot in our yard.  It is virtually tree-less, however, Michigan weather can be unpredictable. Apparently our sunny days do not provide enough juice to keep this thing effectively operating.  I keep the solar panels clean, and wonder what more can be done to make it work better.I revised the review and downgraded stars simply because I need an animal repellent that works consistently.  Think twice about purchasing unless constant sunny conditions can be provided."
302,759,4,"First, like several other reviewers here, this is the first gas-powered trimmer that I've owned in many years. When my old beast died I switched to electric. My first electric was a Black and Decker that worked fine, it died after a few good years and I bought another B&D; that was a piece of junk--and it now lives at the landfill. Then I bought an electric el cheapo from Amazon ($29) and while it will eventually cut grass, you have to be mighty patient while it does it, lol. So, given the opportunity to own a gas-powered machine, I tried it.While I will give the maker credit for supplying a good quick-start guide (and longer manual), I can't say the annoyances of owning a two-cycle motor have gotten any better over the years. This whole business of having to mix gas/oil, priming it endlessly (suggested 10 times), etc., just discourages me from wanting to use this. For a few years I had a landscaper doing my yard and he had an electric start trimmer that I would have bought in an instant if it didn't sell for around $200.OK, so more about this unit: First, it does start pretty well once you get the routine down. I have not had the problem with it stalling out after a few mins--but I have only used it a few times. I'll be curious to see if I run into that issue as well. It did stall the first time that I used it (in just a few min) but I decided to just let it cool for 10 mins and try again and it started right up and did not stall again. One thing I do have an issue with is finding a comfortable and safe way to hold the unit while I'm pulling the starter--it's a trick you learn over time, I think (with any unit, not just this one).Also, some reviewers have talked about the bent shaft and I can see how that might be an issue for taller users, but I'm 5' 9"" and it seems comfortable to me. To be honest, I'm only actually cutting or a few minutes at a time, so it's not like I'm doing a long continuous cut--I'm using it primarily around the edges of the yard. Also, it's still early spring here in New England, so there's not that much to cut yet. But again, the few times that I've tested this, it seems balanced and comfortable--IF you keep your left arm on the handle firmly.My big complaint with this is one I've had with all bump trimmers: sometimes it seems to work, sometimes it just doesn't. With an electric trimmer you can just shut it off and check the line quickly. But with a gas machine if you stop it you have to go through all that starting nonsense all over again. And if it's hot, you may have to wait. You do have to give this trimmer a pretty good whack to get the line started again and that always scares me--it seems like I'm abusing the machine. Does it cut the line and feed it? Yes, it seems like it's acting normally--but I still think it there has to be a better design that doesn't cause you to fear hurting the trimmer by smacking it on a concrete patio, etc.Overall I'm halfway between three stars and four. It runs well once it's going, it seems very powerful (compared to my electric trimmer it's night and day), the manual is good and it feels pretty safe. But again, if I had the money, I think I'd buy a trimmer with electric start. The grass is starting to qrow quickly here this week so I'm going to put it through more testing in a week or two and I will update this review."
692,943,5,"I've had both the 18v and the 24v versions of the Black and Decker cordless trimmers.  The batteries were so huge that it really weighed down the handle and my arm would sometimes be sore by the time I finished the yard.  The batteries also didn't last more than 10-15 minutes and the power level would sometimes get lost when in storage in between each job.  I like this model much more because of the lithium batteries.  The product is much easier to hold for longer periods of time, and it seems more powerful than even the 24v model.  It also lasts longer.  I haven't had a job last more than 20 minutes and the battery lasts the entire time, whereas the 24v version would take two batteries to finish the job.  It is nice that this version comes with two batteries as well.The mower attachment is a neat little idea.  It makes trimming larger areas much easier because you don't have to hold up the entire trimmer the whole time and because you get a more level cut.  It has two cutting levels and it is easy to attach and detach the trimmer to it.I'm much happier with this model than I was with the 24v version with the huge batteries.  It makes the work much easier."
1590,100,5,"Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower, and it will go thru the battery pretty quick, but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower, but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass."
1360,577,4,"Mice.  Not a subject people enjoy discussing but if you find them (there's never just one) in your house it becomes a terribly important topic. This product worked wonderfully, exactly as it was meant to. The trap is easy to set with no risk of pinched fingers. It's safe because the bait or attractant is sealed away from your desirable household pets (dogs and cats)and - if you have a tender heart - you don't have to see the evidence that the trap has worked. The only ""negative"" for me is the cost. At almost five dollars a trap, that's too expensive for me to use once and throw away. Other than that, a great product."
967,885,4,"Summary: If you are going to be off the grid for a good couple of weeks, this might be a good way to keep your devices charged.  Otherwise, I'd seriously consider one of the larger battery packs (see suggestions at the end)I just spent a week in San Diego so I had a chance to see how this performs in decent sun. (even though it's just after the winter solstice)  Although the panel is rated for 7 amps, but this must be full sun with the panel properly aligned.  You're not going to see anywhere near that output except between 10am and 2pm and I certainly never got anywhere near this in practice (Summer or near the equator?  You'll be getting a lot more power).The difficulty is that the loops on the side help you hang this, but there isn't an easy way to position this for optimal sun exposure.  I ended up laying it flat on the table on our balcony.  I was able to charge aNew Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, Tablets and more (Now w/Micro-USB charge port)perhaps one bar over the course of two days.  This suggests that it captured perhaps about 1500 mAh eacy day - enough to keep your average smartphone charged up (as long as you didn't use it too much) but not much more.Here's the rub.  My 12000 mAh battery weighs 10 oz and is enough to do a full charge of my phone about 10 times.  If I were off the grid, it would provide enough power for about 20 days assuming I was careful with usage.The Goal Zero weighs 17 oz.  To properly use the solar panel, I'd really recommend some type of battery pack, so you could easily be up to 20 oz.  The advantage of course is that you'd be good indefinitely (assuming you've got some decent sun)Design and fabrication were very nice, though my panel came with plastic protective sheet on both panes with some sort of chemical haze or ""bloom"" on the epoxy.  I cleaned it off with some polish (Simichrhome) and elbow grease.I've had my New Trent battery pack for about a year and use it regularly on long flights and day hikes, etc.  Anker also has some excellent reviews.  I have a smaller Belkin pack, but it's a lot more dough and as far as I can tell, it hasn't been any more reliable or functional than the New Trent."
987,311,2,"I demand a lot out of my hoses, and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well, I didn't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me. I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer. The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours, the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet. I'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me."
1351,821,3,"In theory, these would be great. No finger mashing, easy clean up, no nastiness in the end. As an item it sounds perfect. We live in the country and field mice are terrible. They get into vehicles and into the mouse despite owning a lot of cats, so we know the mice are there. The problem thusfar has been that it has not produced results.I put these down three days ago, thinking it might be a viable alternative to the cruelty of older traps. Killing mice is not something I am fond of anyhow, and making them suffer seems horribly cruel. Sadly, they just seem to dismiss this and I have had to go back to baiting normal traps.I'll update if it catches a mouse and fill in more then, but it is still sitting there while the other traps are working."
712,560,5,"After reading Amy Stewart's book The Earth Moved: On the Remarkable Achievements of Earthworms, I was immediately taken with the idea of inviting these sweet little beasties into my home, or rather my backyard. Worm castings are great for starting seeds or container gardening of any kind because they are nutritious and help hold moisture in the soil or potting medium. I just scatter my spare castings into my vegetable garden to help improve the soil.The instructions with this bin will lead you to believe you should microwave your food scraps and chop them up tiny for your worms - but they're being way over-cautious. My worms seem perfectly happy with slightly shredded (all vegetable!) kitchen scraps (non-microwaved!), and the worms are about the lowest-maintenance ""pet"" I've had. I check on them whenever I add new kitchen scraps, every 3-4 days or so, and they rarely need anything from me beyond their lettuce and melon bits - every couple months some new shredded newspaper seems to be called for - other than that, they just churn out worm castings and take care of kitchen scraps in a pretty effortless way!If you want to be all gung-ho and learn about worm composting more, you can read Worms Eat my Garbage by Mary Appelhof. This does come with an instructional DVD though, so that will get you well on your way!(Note: This worm bin doesn't come with worms. You can buy red worms separately.)"
985,298,4,This product was easy to set up and bait.I placed this trap in a place rats used to frequent in my garage.  Often in the past the snap traps would have sprung and the bait would be gone.  So far no false alarms (ie green light flashing but no rat) and the bait is still in place.The hardest part of this set up was getting the batteries properly placed.  It was a very tight fit.
1156,574,5,"This platform is very well built, from indestructible looking material. I got it for Mourning Doves, among others, however. So, I'm dissapointed that the hanging wires are so close together that they are afraid to land. That's a function of the platform's size...the wires could be farther apart only if the platform was bigger. My husband says not to worry about it...the Jays will never let the Doves on there, anyway!"
30,903,4,"I had a little trouble with this at first, the batteries that were included were dead but no big deal just pull off the bottom from the container and easy to change.  I then found it wasn't flushing the lawn flood granules out correctly so had to turn the mechanism.Once I did this then everything was fine and it is quite a novel idea.  Basically you pull out the yellow lever to spread the lawn food and push it back in to stop.  If you get a clump of lawn food and it sticks then give it a shake.  You might also have to do this when it is getting low.As far as the lawn food effect on the garden, it seems to have improved and instead of getting scrappy looking grass there is some consistency there.  I also used this same spreader for putting 'moss out' in and for some grass seed and it worked well so the spreader would be useful for anything which is like small granules.So conclusion the actual lawn food product is excellent, the spreader is a great idea and you can use it for other things so good buy overall."
1426,844,5,This cool looking little lantern comes with 4 AA batteries and one container of scented mosquito repellent. Each refill is supposed to work for up to 3 months but I am sure that its effectiveness would be greatly reduced after that long. The lantern itself is very small and cute. It's black with plastic (looks like glass) windows. You remove the top and install the batteries and open the refill container and load it into the bottom of the lantern. Then you flip the sliding switch that is on the bottom to turn it on. When you turn it on the fan in the middle will turn on and will circulate the scent through the lantern and out the top. It provides up to 64 sq. ft. of protection. It works well to sit out on a deck or on a table to keep the nasty mosquitos away. It also has 4 LED lights at the top of the lantern that make it look like a real lantern. The fan is very quiet and you won't even hear it unless you get real close or hold it up to your ear. I hate wearing stinky mosquito repellent so I really like this option to repel them.
1019,921,4,"This solar-powered light system has a lot to recommend it, and just a couple of flaws.  Let&#8217;s start with the good:1. It&#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn't as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn't be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package. Did I mention that the system is pricey?On the whole, this is a good product for lighting a shed, exterior garage or a one-room summer cabin."
1626,482,5,"We first used this on a camping trip two years ago, and have been sold on it ever since - it's hard to find in stores so I'm glad I can get it from Amazon.  It works every bit as well as, if not better than, the common deet-containing sprays, but it smells a LOT better, plus you don't have to worry about inhaling the overspray, or getting it onto your hands and therefore inevitably into your mouth, etc.  (I mean sure, deet is probably still safer than west nile virus, but you never know what it will do to you years down the road.)  We had given up hope that a deet-free repellent could actually work (most of them don't, and are greasy to boot!) but this one truly does - it kept us bite-free camping in the Caribbean, and if that's not a real test of a bug repellent, I don't know what is!Be careful though and look closely at the label when you buy it - the makers of Repel have recently broken down and started making a version of their product that does contain some deet, in order to try and woo the ""it can't possibly work without deet"" market, but that version sort of defeats the entire purpose of using an organic product, you know?  If you are concerned about deet, the regular version of Repel is the way to go."
333,831,5,"I stuffed this pint-sized chimney starter to the brim and hoped as I poured lit charcoals into my Weber 18 inch grill.  Well, that one load kept good heat for 2 hours and some, cooking 2 pork roasts, 3 pounders each, 6 chicken leg quarters, 4 top sirloin 2 inch square steaks, two lamb chops, and finished with 4  leg quarters to use up the extra heat.  I was surprised and very content.  That domed insert that positions the charcoal really works.  Those other chimneys with the flat insert take a good 40% longer with unburnt charcoals.  It's a whole lot cheaper than its European clone as well."
773,577,2,"I really really REALLY wanted these to work...  If they had, I would pay almost any price, to not have to deal with a mouse, dead or alive...  They are easy to set, but when I put one trap side by side with a traditional wood trap, the mice preferred the wooden one...  When I left the Kill and Seal as the only choice, they snubbed it and kept on making my life miserable.  Replace the Kill and Seal with a wooden trap, and SNAP!... got the little bugger.  So...  I am still hopeful that eventually they will catch something...  Meanwhile, I buy wooden traps by the dozen, and use a long handled dust pan and broom to toss mouse and trap, which is much cheaper, although not as aesthetically pleasing..."
1085,778,2,I filled it and put it outside on my porch. The small birds don't use it at all. The larger birds have tried several times but they weigh too much and the feeder starts to sway and the birds can't hang on and leave.
741,410,5,Just love the Gilmore hoses they always deliver
1489,932,5,"Constant visitors to this feeder!  Hummingbirds love it, bees are not a problem, and ant moat works well.  Secure hook well for windy days, since vessel is glass."
894,470,5,"Oh happy day I have not seen an ant in what seems like forever.  I don't know what it is about this house but the seem to congregate on our patio.Its very annoying,  plus the kids keep getting bit and that's no fun.  However after an easy application around the foundation of our house those ants are no where to be seen.This stuff is worth it,  so if you have an ant problem do yourself a favor and go pick some up."
855,235,4,"I wasn't aware that they made rakes that kept the bark and dirt where it was supposed to be, until I stumbled upon this.  It works great and isn't super expensive. Good use for flower beds and areas where you don't want to disturb the soil too much."
115,30,5,I bought this for the simplicity of clean up.  I wish the kettle had an adjustable coal grate to lower or make higher the direct heat.  It takes a while to get it just right with the right amount coal.  But overall great quality.
1663,928,5,So far this has worked great. It didn't smell to bad when we put it down. It spread nicely. The grass seems greener. It is herd to tell how the weeds will be affected but so far I recommend it. I love that it is organic.
878,493,3,"I was hoping to have a more thorough review and be able to show some actual results. However, despite placing this in a couple of obvious locations, including one out in our storage shed that's far from being as &#34;sealed&#34; as the house I've not yet trapped anything. The good news is that this appears to be a really nice design and it certainly couldn't be easier to bait and set. If I ever find that it's actually caught a rodent I'll be sure to update my review."
362,527,5,"Perky Pet has introduced a well-thought-out series of feeders with ""antique"" glass bottle nectar reservoirs.This particular model -- the red ""liquor"" bottle -- has a 16-ounce capacity. The bottle is specially made for the feeder -- it isn't really an antique. It has little hummingbirds and the Perky Pet name embossed in it.The bottom part of the base is plastic. The top part is metal, with candy apple red feeding port flowers. The base is flat on the bottom so you can easily stand the feeder during cleaning. And the base separates into two halves for easy cleaning, and the hanger at the top of the glass bottle is nice and secure.The proof of the good design is in the ""flip"" -- that point after refilling that you turn the feeder over for hanging. Not a drop of nectar spills when I flip mine. Other feeders spill a lot. Not this one.So do the hummers like it? You bet they do. I suspect there's an advantage to a glass reservoir that appeals to hummers -- less plastic taste or smell.I'm hoping the metal part of the base has a good coat of clear lacquer on it to keep it from rusting. I'm making sure to use a soft sponge for washing it so I don't accidentally scrub off any clear coat.Love this series of feeders! I hope they last years!"
810,286,3,The seed has a lot of filler.  Not sure it's worth the money.
864,256,5,"Perfect small side table to use for cups and other lightweight items. It is short and it isn't the most sturdy table, but for the price you can't beat it. It gets the job done."
1531,666,5,"Damn that is a good looking grill!  I went with the copper colored E-310 grill.  I had seen them in stores and they looked great.  I was very surprised to see how much better it looks in the sunshine.  That grill sparkles!  The copper color is actually a metallic copper that I did not notice in the stores, I was pleasantly surprised.I have owned many, many grills over the years, but never a Weber propane grill.  The other grills always lasted a few years, then the burners needed to be replaced, and they never worked the same again.  My last grill, a Kenmore, served me well for about 6 years.  I decided it was time to replace it because the hinges were rusted along with the propane slide out rack that rusted and did not move.  The stainless steel cover had stains on it.  Seriously?  Why exactly do they call it ""stainless"" steel if it can stain?  Then the door latches broke and I had to keep them closed with a bungee cord.  There is something about using bungee cords to keep doors closed that just struck me as very trashy looking, so it was time to upgrade.I have some experience with Webers, but never on the propane side.  I currently have two Weber charcoal grills, aWeber 751001 22.5-Inch One-Touch Goldand aWeber Performer Grill 1424001 Charcoal Grillwhich both perform well.  I also have two smokers, one homemade out of a 55 gallon drum, and I just finished building a wood fired pizza oven.  Yes, I know, its an addiction, but I love cooking in my yard. I have a few projects for this summer, I am building a firepit, and an outdoor fireplace off my deck.  The fireplace will have a Santa Maria type cooking surface integrated into it. I am also in the process of building a site dedicated to cookinginmyyard. Hopefully that will be up soon.  I only mention these things to add validity to my review.  I may not be the ultimate resource for grills, but I do think my experience counts.Now back to the grill.  Its a Weber, so you probably already know it is well made.  I think it is sturdy and well designed.  I went with the E-310 because I did not need side burners.  I found that I rarely used the side burners but I did need the side shelves, so why spend extra money for something I won't be using.  There is a sturdy feel to the grill, this is not a cheap knock-off grill.The cooking surface is cast iron and thick.  That means it will take a few minutes to heat up fully, but the thick cast iron transfers really nice grill marks onto my steaks.  Plus I do not think the cast iron will rust out too soon and need to be replaced.  The propane holder is actually a gas gauge too.  The tank hangs on a sliding mechanism and gives you a visual display of the tank contents.  That will come in handy because I have run out of gas a time or two in the past.  And it always happens on Sunday night when I cannot jump into the car to get the tank refilled.Why did I go with a Weber?  Because I am tired of replacing grills every so many years.  I plan on living a long time, and grilling very often on this grill, and I fully expect it to give me great service for many years to come."
759,712,5,bluebirds love these..just wish they sold them in larger volume
685,827,5,I purchased this to paint my cedar raised gardens.  It seemed to have worked well and it goes a long way.
606,237,5,"This product from Tomcat works great, just like all the other Tomcat products. It helped us get rid of our little problem and now things are back to normal."
1108,662,5,Easy to put together... about 5 minutes for 2 of them. READ the directions and it's easy. Strong seat that holds my 235 pounds firmly.  Looks great and holds a lot of stuff.
1284,874,3,"It's good that these are ""specially selected"" to not include GMO seeds...It's good that there's a fair variety of seeds, ""pre-planted"" into little pods - that you, in turn, plant into actual dirt.  Wait a minute!  That's just weird.So most gardeners have used peat pots or other seedling containers.  Miracle-Gro has...put a seed in said container for you, along with ""soil"" and nutrients (not organic), and you plant the entire container.  I suppose the draw here is that the seed is planted at the correct depth, but that's such a trivial thing to do on your own, it's difficult to figure out who these little seed pods are actually designed for.If you happen to really want to be able to dig a hole big enough for this entire pod rather than a tiny spot for a small seed, you may be happy in the end - the plants have emerged so there is actually a seed in there.  It hasn't been long enough to see how the plants perform, but at least there's a seed in there!  I'll update this if the rating should change significantly based on how the plant continues to grow.With all that said, I wouldn't personally buy or recommend these.  Some peat pots and packet of seeds gives you more variety and options.  Top Rated seed companies like Territorial Seed Company, High Mowing Seeds, Seed Savers Exchange and others provide much more for a lesser cost.  You likely have an alternate seed company in your region that specializes in seeds that grow in your conditions, as well - rather than a very large company selling seeds that ""work anywhere"" (and aren't ideal anywhere) or that may not be best suited for you."
546,597,3,"Got this as I needed a smaller snow thrower and tired of pushing snow shovels. Unfortunately cannot tell you how it works, as it did not snow after I got it."
1615,527,5,"This is a gorgeous bird feeder.  It is made from a beautiful, red piece of sturdy glass. It further has a hummingbird etch with the brand name on the bottle.  There is also a strong hanger to attach to a tree or deck.  The bottom of the feeder has a high quality, brushed nickel look to it that compliments the red.  There are 4 metal flowers that are of high quality on the base where the birds drink from.  It holds 16 ounces and I like that I don't need to dye the liquid due to the red glass.  It is beautiful when the sun hits the glass.  This really is the prettiest, highest quality bird feeder I have ever owned.  Highly recommended for self and gifts."
366,81,4,"I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better, richer, darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well, I called the company and after a few passes around the office, I was told, then confirmed by another employee, that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So, they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose, but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer, mom, mage"
630,439,5,"I'm also in Oklahoma and as another reviewer mentioned, our winters can be cold or mild, but our summers are dependably hot and long.  I haven't succeeded at actually growing kiwi yet because my first try several years ago, I planted them in less than great soil in full sun and didn't give them enough attention.  My first plants were larger, older and much more expensive plants purchased from a different nursery.  They predictably succumbed to the poor site and lack of attention.Next try was smaller, less expensive plants that I planted in partial shade, better soil and watered regularly.  They were growing nicely until rabbits or squirrels decided to chew off the vines near the soil.This time I plan to use the partially shaded site and protect my young vines with hardware cloth until they are thick enough and strong enough to no longer appeal to the creatures who rule our yard.This purchase was the least expensive of my three attempts at growing kiwi.  When I received the potted plants, the female had green buds, but the male was not alive.  I contacted the seller about the male plant and he immediately resolved the problem.  I purchased a replacement for the male and it arrived alive with green buds along the vines.Even though the plants are relatively small, they are very vigorous and healthy.  Mine are still inside and are growing fast.  If I do my part and adequately protect and care for them, I expect them to be a terrific bargain.Having purchased from this seller for many years, I trust them.  This was the first time I ever received a dead plant from them and it was quickly and easily resolved.  They had some of the best prices and offer an enormous selection of plants and seeds that are often difficult to obtain."
92,23,5,"For the appropriate hummingbird feeder(s), these little guards are a &#34;must have&#34; if you are going to keeps bees and other insects from seriously messing up your feeders."
296,838,3,"I really enjoyed using this hose for about two weeks until I stretched it a little far and .....it busted :(  Prior to that it is so light and easy to move around and put up that I really enjoyed it but if the max life is less than a month, it just isn't worth it."
1405,151,4,"Great little hose to water my plants and drink from. It does leak a bit. I do like the easy connector. I just wish it did not leak so much. A handy little hose for just about anything. Also, it is fairly priced and no problems with kinking."
787,874,2,"I usually garden with starts, not seeds, so I thought these might be a good way to learn to love seeds, but I was so disappointed. While there is a nice variety, once I opened it up and read the directions, I was a bit aghast at how little food this kit makes, and how much packaging it uses. I think I pictures smaller pods--more like little protective peat bullets--and a lot more of them, 18 types, not 18 total (so that's my fault--but that doesn't make this product any less silly). These are little pointy peat pots, about the size of a tiny Dixie cup, filled with soilless mix and 2 seeds, with a peel off lid like a little tub of coffee creamer.I'd give it 0 stars for me, but if you're a city dweller with only a tiny sunny balcony and a few pots, or someone not concerned with actual yield who just wants a tidy, educational project for small kids, this might be a fun and cute way to grow a bitty bit of food. If you have any space at all, it makes no sense.Seriously, who plants one bush bean plant? That's one dinner. Ditto the lettuce and pepper.Even if your space is limited, if you want one of each plant, buy starts for the herbs and vegetables and a packet of bean seeds. You'll spend about the same, get to pick more interesting varieties, and be that much closer to harvest and with no fussing over tender shoots, which can get knocked off by one hungry bug or especially hot or cold morning. Or if you love seeds, this price tag will get you a good 8-12 packets or more of seeds, giving you a full garden, and probably plenty to save for next year.Germination wasn't spectacular, either. The cups didn't seem to hold any more moisture than just plain soil (but I do have good, sheep poo-enriched soil), and didn't germinate any better than bare seeds. I don't get the rave reviews, unless others are a lot richer and grow vegetables for novelty rather than the table.If this were an herbs-only kit, I *might* be able to see it, since that's more where you'll see spreading and a couple seeds going a long way. But one bean plant? That's just deranged."
894,842,4,"We like to grow vegetables inside when its cold. Its fun for the kids and it ensures we have fresh veggies on hand.As with any plant when you've got one you really like or just want to grow more and not wait for seeds you clone it. This product worked great for the assortment of veggies and fruit that we tried it on. In little to no time at all we were in business with roots all over the place.So if  its a house plant, a flower, fruit or veggie and you want to clone it then pick up some of this stuff you'll be glad you did."
666,605,5,"the birds and squirrels love this stuff. it is priced right and comes in a nice bag, and is easy to dispense the product from it."
1492,928,5,I have never used a product that showed results so fast. My lawn was mostly straw to brown in overall appearance with some new green starting to appear. This was so easy to apply no odor at all. I just use a hand spreader. I read the directions walked the yard took about 15 minutes then it says to immediately wet the lawn. I just got the hose and did it by hand as we had rain for a few days previous.  I watered for about 20 minutes making sure it all got wet. The next day I thought my eyes are deceiving me it looked a bit greener. Day to I saw yes it is a bit greener. Today is day three I could not believe my eyes it is beautiful. I imagine it will get even better wish I had taken a before picture. I am glad it is zero phosphate and a better for the environment product. No question about it this is what I will be buying from now on. Love no odor and you would pay about $60 here for just one treatment that is toxic and doesn't produce this kind of result. Very happy I tried this product. Not worrying about burning the lawn is a huge plus too.
1262,705,5,I ordered one of these to check it out. It's the 10 gallon and turned out better then I expected. Handles are included and sewn right on. Should work out great this year. The material is similar to garden fabric but a lot thicker. We are going to try tomatos in the 10 gallon.
1600,896,4,"I like this kit , it has some really neat feature.  I am dinging it 1 star because it does not include a micro usb cable which is by far the most common for cell phones and tablets now a days.  I found it to charge up the included batteries fairly quickly via the solar panels.  The battery pack's built in LED flashlight is not great, but will do in a pinch.  Great for those of us that live in a sunny state.  Also the panels can  be hooked up in parallel if you have more than one."
1260,906,5,"I have a decent size lawn and yard.  I usually use two hoses, one for the front, one for the back.  I used to buy cheap department store hoses, but they usually didn&#8217;t last and would kink a lot.  The last time around I spent a bit more and got a better quality hose.  I found it was thicker and more durable, but still kinked often - even though it was advertises as &#8220;no kink.&#8221;  I have a lot of landscaping and as I wind around shrubs, flowers, rocks, trees, and paving, I almost always end up with a hose kinked, or stuck on something.  Then I have to stop what I am trying to do, go back and free up the hose, etc.Enter the Scotts MaxFex.  While it is still winter and my use of this hose has been limited, I have used it to wash the cars and flush a gutter.The hose measures 50 feet in length.  The couplings appear to be brass; they are marketed as being lead free.  The entire hose is advertised as lead-free, which makes it &#8220;drinking water safe.&#8221;This is not an inexpensive hose.  However, for the extra $10 or $20 you may spend, to me &#8211; it is well worth it.  The hose is clearly made very well.  The couplings are heavy duty and the hose has a nice feel to it.  You can see and feel that it is reinforced.  It has what Scotts calls &#8220;Lay Flat&#8221; technology.  Basically it tends to keep its shape, which helps it resist kinks.  They refer to it as being &#8220;kink resistant&#8221; which I am fine with, as I hate to buy a &#8220;kink free&#8221; hoses that kink.  At least here, they are telling you it should avoid kinks, but &#8211; just about anything flexible can kink.I keep my hoses in storage containers made for that purpose (decorative with a cylinder in the middle to wrap the hose around).  Even with my decent hoses, I tend to have to fight and exert some strength to roll the hose around and around into the container.  Yet with the MaxFlex, I found it recoiled quite nicely, allowing me to more easily roll it into the storage container.In the short time I have had it, this hose has demonstrated an ability to maintain shape, recoil very easily, and to avoid kinks.  In fact, not a single kink yet &#8211; again I have used it just 2 or 3 times.What has really pleased me is the way it keeps its shape and tends to continue to slide around things as you pull it, rather than become snagged on things.  People often complain about a hose that kinks, but to me snagging on things is just as bad.  I hate having to stop what I am doing, retrace my steps and go free up the hose from whatever it got caught on.  So far, this hose has tended to slide freely around objects and hasn&#8217;t snagged &#8211; even once.I will update the review as I continue to use it.To me, this hose is well worth the extra cost versus an average hose.  I am buying a second one for the yard.Scotts also backs it with a limited lifetime warranty."
1175,349,3,"I bought this for tree fertilizing not for bulb planting. I have a 19.2 volt drill. Using this in tough conditions. But unless I flood the ground it makes almost no headway. And when I flood it, it still doesn't go down quite enough.If you intend this for fertilizing at least in clay soils, it might not work so well. I was looking forward to some deep fertilizing and unfortunately has not worked as I had hoped."
1205,229,4,"This stuff chases away pests from the house area, back to the woods where they belong.  It does not repel bears, salesmen, or coyotes, but it isn't supposed to do that.The beauty of it it that it is not a poison.  I enjoy sharing the land with critters, but don't want them right up to the house.  If it will work on the colony of flying squirrels in my attic, I will update it's rating to 5 stars."
1451,856,4,"Though B&D; owns just about everybody including DeWalt, the brand has never been known as a serious player in lawn gear and power tools. That is until now. Their latest in lawn tools have come a long way. This blower is surprisingly better then I thought it would be. After almost six weeks use these are my thoughts.This model comes with (1) 36 volt lithium ion battery, charger, blow tube, and a two year warranty. Let's face it. Black & Decker will never win any awards for providing outstanding instructions. Still, out of the box assembly takes seconds. Just snap the nozzle pieces together, lock it into the slot and you're in business. Fully assembled this unit measures 37"" long from butt to nozzle tip. With the battery on board the total weight is easily a little over 5 lbs. Unlike my older blower I like the comfortable soft grip feature on this model.This unit operates off of a B&D; 36 volt lithium ion battery. The battery is outfitted with an onboard power indicator. The power switch is ideally mounted and simple to use. With a flick of the thumb you're in business. The multi level power switch is also sweet. Just keep in mind the higher the number the less juice users will have in the end. Fully charged I get almost a half hour before a noticeable drop off in power. I do enjoy the low noise feature. Make no mistake, this model does suck down the juice. No worries. ninety minutes later I had a full charge.The blower feature works like a charm. Its not going to beat my gas powered one, but it does perform. It easily took care of my sidewalk, driveway and back patio with no real issues. It also does well clearing small water puddles on the walkway. I did notice a bit of vibration when I pushed the blower to its highest (6) power setting. Not a deal breaker unless the screws start popping off. I'll gladly update this review if there is more to that issue.All in all, I'm impressed with this Black & Decker product. I do like the extra power. Since it arrival, its been my go to blower. That says it all. Its a keeper."
404,375,5,Installed on my Weber NG E310 and it provides plenty of light to cook with even in the twilight. I purchased 2 of them as I do a lot of grilling after the sun hides behind the earth's curvature. It also has 2 bar holders; 1 for a straight bar & 1 for a curved bar. Just a minor problem; be sure you have 3 AAA batteries available to install in light.
438,613,1,First the line won't feed. Then the line won't stop feeding. Then the excess line wraps around the hub. Then the weeds wrapped around the hub. Then the electric motor overheated. And so ended the first (and last) half hour of using this cheap piece of garbage.
925,411,1,"Regarding the Gilmour brass garden hose nozzle models 528 and 528T528 (rubber jacketed verison of the 528T):I bought this Gilmour nozzle first and...It Broke!!! well, LEAKS is a better choice of words...where the shaft of the inner core mates with the base of the nozzle that screws onto the hose. They are two separate parts that appear to be press-fit togetther! And it leaks alot...not just drip, 2 seconds, drip..it has become a small trickle. Worse, the core and the outer twist part now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray. To try and make this clearer, I can no longer grasp the long outer jacket and twist to adjust the spray, because it spins at the faulty juncture. Haven't even had it 4 months.528T:I bought this nozzle based soley on the positive reviews. Upon inspection of this nozzle when it arrived, it became immediately clear that the same 'press-fit' manufacturing technique was used in the assembly of the 528T as in the rubber jacketed 528. The Gilmour products that utilize this 'press fit' manufacturing technique have, in my experience, an unacceptable failure rate, and are not the perfect hose nozzles we thought they might be...but this one might be:Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose NozzleWarrantyGilmour covers this product, (and presumably the 528), with a 'Lifetime Replacement Policy' stating they will replace the product free of charge. They do not provide a telephone number on the packaging but rather an address, and a P.O. box number at that. I have no doubt they will send you another one, 'free of charge'. But who wants it? Especially in light of the fact that there are better products out there that cost no more."
1337,437,4,Great fit and nice looking cover.  Wish it had a way to attach it more securely as the wind can sometimes lift it off the grill.
1415,834,1,"This stuff does not work at all.  It did not deter squirrels, raccoons, gophers, or groundhogs--not one iota.  The bottle spray mechanism does not work well either--when used the product gets all over your hands and, while the smell is not awful, it is not at all pleasant either.  Don't waste your money."
1613,562,4,"I can't really say one way or the other, as it's a compost heap and it's supposed to compost, but this product seemed to help kick things off."
534,868,5,"Love the shape of this hanging basket.  Although it's specially constructed with water retaining fiber, it looks very natural.  The hanging chain is also exceptional.  To be as pretty as this basket and as  moisture retaining but at the same time, slowly drying and very supportive of the planting it contains, this  basket is a ""win-win"" addition.  I am very proud to have this basket filled with flowers hanging from my front porch.'"
245,387,5,"I think this was a great investment... I'm really glad I bought this size compared to most smaller brand chimney starters...When filling this all the way up with charcoal, it's plenty enough to put into a 22"" grill, but when using a smaller one like my gas & charcoal grill combo, you can put less in. When putting newspaper in bottom to start, I use approximately 4 smaller advertisement papers... I fold roll the paper long ways and train around chimney and leave a small hole in middle for air to flow free up into coals... this way it seems to catch fire a little easier & faster... my starter takes approximately 15min. to get going good... charcoals are generally almost all white and ready to empty... I love it and highly recommend, as a easier way to start coals without charcoal fluid."
123,869,1,"Update - as promised, I'm updating this review. Once again, it has died a pre-mature death with the exact same problem as the prior unit. Light's up to show the battery working/alive. Doesn't spray. Plain and simple, these don't see to last. Given the price, can no longer recommend an item with just over a year average life expectancy.Original Review...I hard the earlier version of this same sprayer and liked it immensely until it suddenly quit working. Given the cost and relatively brief time the unit worked, I was hesitant to purchase one (the prior had been via a Vine review). However, like many people, this seemed to be the most humane way to deal with raccoons that have been wrecking havoc in our  yard. The little buggers have figured out the traps and won't go near them, the dogs go crazy over the little coons and none of the plants are safe after both racoon and dogs go pouncing over them.This works beautifully for both the dogs and the racoons so everyone is happy. It looks almost exactly like the old one and works in the same manner except this one doesn't spray back/forward like the old one but rather in a burst fashion. Personally I prefer the older motion but either way this gets the job done. Simply fill with water, allow to charge in the sun, set the range and leave. It's that easy. Assuming the lifespan of this one is longer than the last, I give this a full 5 stars as an effective yet humane way to deal with critters, keeping dogs out and so forth. I will update if the unit fails too soon."
606,874,5,When these arrived I was thrilled! We purchased our first home towards the end of last year so this is the first summer we have been able to have a garden. These were so easy to plant - honestly it couldn't get any easier unless I hired someone else to do it. If you are looking for an easy way to start growing yummy vegetables and herbs this is the kit for you!
1639,869,5,"I wanted this to scare away rabbits and the occasional deer that wander in to our backyard. Rabbits do set it off.  The spray lasts about 3 seconds, which seems to be enough to scare the rabbits that have triggered it.The spray is surprisingly strong.  It seems to spray like any other hose-powered circular pulsating sprinkler.  It sprays out to approximately 25 feet as the instructions claim.  The ""travel"" and the water spray distance are both adjustable.Test the unit without water first (like the instructions say), as it will save a lot of battery drain while testing.The unit is infrared (IR) so body heat sets it off, not motion like tree branches in the wind, etc.  I haven't had any issue with branches, etc.  setting it off even on very windy days.The area I am protecting doesn't see a lot of action, but it hasn't run low on battery yet.  I can't be sure without watching it for 24 hours, but I would estimate it sprays about 3 times a day max.I like that it's solar so no batteries to change & no hose to drag across the patio/lawn.  I tested it on a perfectly sunny day to see how many sprays in a row it would do; it did 12 & then needed to recharge.  Within an hour, it was charged enough to activate again - Then I got 14 sprays out of it. They were somewhat weaker by the 10th spray but would have chased away a rabbit.  I'd say that's more than enough for my situation.The unit is bigger than what I was expecting but that's mainly because of the water reservoir.  It's black so not obnoxious looking sitting on the corner of my patio and no hose trailing after it."
381,209,5,"I bought one of those heavy garden hose that Costco sells (grey colored and made in USA) and if you know what I am talking about, you know those things are heavy. I use this in my garage and it keeps the hose organized and tucked away in the corner. I was not sure if it will take the weight, but it is very sturdy and I am going to buy one more for the backyard."
299,768,5,"As much as I hate getting poison on my hands, I love these mouse poison stations as they are refillable.  If you have a large influx of mice (rainy season, cold weather), this is your best choice for getting rid of the little critters.  They eat, they die - you replace the bait blocks when the poison runs out (which is easy to see from the top of the station).  Tomcat is quickly outdoing the major brand of mouse poison.  I will, indeed, buy this again."
879,504,4,"I have the Victor M240 Electronic Rat Trap. It worked GREAT, (I even posted pics of the victim, eek!) but the batterries were a pain to get in, no manual, and it pooped out quickly. I am going to try to clean the plates with alcohol and see if that works. As far as the M260, I can say right off the bat that the batteries on THIS model are a breeze, and not only does it have a manual that explains every blinking light meaning, it even lists the 800 number right there where it should be!I'm putting it out today, 6/22/11, and will update when the critters start getting caught.8/18/11 the light went out, trap empty. When I have time I'll contact customer service as I LOVE the cruelty free aspect (It kills instantly, and sadly since the rodents are in an area where other animals can be badly harmed by them, it is a tough choice but the rodents have to go. It is a better option than the pain of poison or traps....complain about my 'cruelty' only if you spend part of your money to spay and neuter rats) but right now I'm a bit disappointed.EDIT: took the batteries out, and within days my dog was sniffing around the trap. Sure enough, one little varmint was in it! YAY!"
1444,425,5,"Here in southern Alabama it get very hot in the Summer.  I purchased this umbrella to provide shade while working at the grill.  It works great and, with its offset, is completely out of the way while coking.  I love it, and my grand kids think it is pretty cool.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a grill shade."
1167,140,4,Works great to get seeds started and roots going; especially along with using the Hydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System
1557,700,5,"I saw an online review of this product and ordered some. I seem to have a better rooting percentage than I used to, not sure why but it might be because it's almost a gel and sticks to the stems."
158,76,5,This is great for me. I can keep all of my garden essentials organized and available. I highly recommend this product.
1393,477,4,"The sky is falling worry warts are out.  &#34;Poison in the bird seed&#34;.. they cry.  Stop and think about it.  If this was the case and it was at one time, would  Amazon continue to keep selling it?  Could they afford to do that?  According to what I've read, this (and yes it was awful) practice was halted in 2008.I've been feeding this seed - I just ordered another 40 pounds on prime - for some time and compared to Kaytee, Warners and a few super market specials, the birds seem to prefer this way above all others.  I barely get in the house before the feeders are 'attacked'.  Yes, it's like they were just sitting and waiting for me to fill it up.  It's a big variety I have here in south eastern Wisconsin too.  Finches, chickadees, cardinals, jays, juncos loads of woodpeckers etc. etc.As an aside, there are loads of squirrels around my wooded lot.  They do not hit the feeders.  I load the seed with the cheapest brand of cayenne  pepper I can find.  Really layer it up in the bucket I carry the seed in.  Once a squirrel has  found the hot stuff, it doesn't come back and the word seems to be passed on to the rest of the gang.  Even this year's youngsters seem to get the message.  They do clean up around the ground under the feeders though, so they still get a treat, just a second hand one.Oh yeah, I haven't seen any dead birds around since I've been feeding this feed.  It's a good buy, especially if you have prime, and I'll continue to serve it at our feeders as long as I can get it."
930,167,5,"So far so good!!!  Even after the rain for two days the deer are leaving my plants and shrubs alone finally...easy spray with the battery powered sprayer so my arthritic hands did not give out spraying.  A great product from Amazon at great price that actually deters the critters.  You will have to try this to see how easily it works.

908,762,5,"Before these plant clips arrived, I would use a variety of stick elements combined with twist-ties to stake my dahlias and other flowers.  This method had its downsides, including:1. The twist-ties had usually rusted by the time the dahlias died back, making them hard to remove (required for city composting)2. They typically looked unsightly.These clips go on and come off easily, they look like leaves, and their design accommodates a growing stem.I would happily pay this price for clips I can use and re-use."
171,391,5,"Our warm-up basket was in bad shape and we found this on-line.  The grill looks new and most of all, my husband is happy."
769,189,3,"I have been using this product for awhile to see if it made a big difference. It works in a small area, I tried it on a large area and the Deer still came. I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again. Overall for a small area this will work great for you. A large area you need to adjust all to see how much you can get covered"
757,899,4,"Update 12/13/13 - After using the vacuum portion for awhile to vacuum up fall leaves, one annoyance has become obvious - when you go to attach the vacuum tube to the bottom, it is very awkward to try to balance it and slide it into the slot and lock it into place.  Seems like it should be so easy, but it always takes me multiple tries and fumbling with it and sometimes when I think I've got it, then I pick it up and knock the tube on any little thing and it falls off again.  This process is very frustrating and makes me dread having to use it as vacuum.  Everything else about this blower/vac is fantastic, but that one small thing really ruins the fun and ease of using this.  Battery life continues to impress, as I haven't yet run it all the way down before completing a job.This blower vac is nice and powerful, when used at the top setting - the lower settings are not very useful as it doesn't blow hard enough at the lower settings to really accomplish much. I confess I didn't immediately see the red button that puts it into high gear, but once you push it, look out - this blower really goes to town. On max settings this blower seems to easily put out as much power as a gas powered blower - definitely more powerful than any other battery operated blower that I've tried.This blower is definitely way more powerful than my Worx 18volt li-ion cordless blower, however, it is also quite a bit larger which makes it a little less comfortable to blow grass clippings off after mowing, however I'd say the bulkier size is definitely worth it for the increased power you get.  The size/weight of this is comparable to my corded Toro vac/blower, and it performs as strongly or better than it, but you get the bonus of no power cord.The battery on this lasts about on average to other blowers, since all blowers seem to run down the batteries quickly - I was able to blow and vacuum up all my grass clippings without running the battery down, while with the Worx blower and I would have to switch batteries half way thru. So far, I have been easily able to do all by blowing/vacuuming on one charge.  If you really want to stretch the battery run time out, you can run it at a lower setting or not in high mode.I also like how easy it is to convert from blower to vac - attach the tube to the bottom and lock it in and replace the blower tube with the bag and you're ready to go.  I use this weekly for the yard, since i mulch mow - i use it as a blower to blow all the grass clippings and leaves into a pile and then switch it to vac mode to suck up the leaves and clippings to use as mulch elsewhere.  I can't wait till fall finally comes to Texas and I can try it out on all the leaves that will get dropped in the yard.As for price, I think that if you really want the power of a gas blower or corded, then this is absolutely worth every penny.  If you don't necessarily need max power and maybe only want to do light blowing of leaves or grass clippings, then maybe the cheaper non digipro version of this might be a better fit."
907,742,3,"What an amazing outdoor table!  I will list a few of the pros:+ Heavy and sturdy build+ Attractive, tightly woven texture+ Great natural color+ Legs have small round 'bumps' that keep the bottom from scratching any scuffable surface+ Hollow inside supported by metal frame (durable!)+ Weather proofed powder coated aluminum finishI can't really say anything negative about this table.  It is rather large, so it's tight on small patios.  But it makes a great place to serve drinks or snacks (I would keep drinks on a tray).  I even like to cock my feet up on it and use it as an ottoman.  I really don't see this thing needing replacing or repair for a number of years.  With the aluminum finish, I don't expect to see any fading from sun, or any adverse effects from rain.  I would probably keep an eye on the underside for spiders or mold (if those are problems in your are like they are in 'sunny' Oregon), but that is to be expected from a hollow table of this style.  I highly recommend it.-----------------Update:  If you want to have glasses, plates, etc on this table, then you need to get a tray of some sort.  I actually use a side table for my beverage, making this table not much more than a footrest.  Rating reduced.  It's just that there is not really any reinforcement except around the edges and through the center of the table.  The table covering bows any time you put something on it.  It won't even support a stemless wine glass without the glass tipping.But if you don't mind using a tray, then it's good."
1482,740,5,"What is a chair?  is there an essence of ""chairness"" that defines what a chair is?Shut your yap, Socrates, and sit yourself down in this Strathwood Griffen.  Comfortable, feels strong, built for in-door and out-door, this is the right chair for me.See, I had this spot, and I wanted this nice chair ($1900) that was shaped like a catcher's mit ($1900) and was just wonderful.  But common sense (my smart wife) and the price (did I mention $1900?) pushed me into a differnet direction, a chair I could open the door on, let the wind come into the 4-season, and just sit down and relax.The chiar is square, this is a square chair, not a sloucher or a glorified bean bag of a chair, but a real deal chair, with some fiber.  Should you get the entire set?  You should get the chair.  The set may or may not follow.I like this chair.  And it does not resemble a catcher's mit and does not cost $1900."
424,285,5,"We put a fire in this pit for the first time last night-- the temp dipped down to 18 degrees and it was nice to enjoy a clear night but stay warm.The copper pit is extremely attractive and the frame that holds it is both attractive and stable. We burned the fire for about 45 minutes and then decide to move it farther away from a nearby tree and found we could pick it up by the wrought iron if we used kitchen mitts. It does get pretty hot so you'd definitely want to keep it on brick or sand.The lid fit snugly and was a nice safety feature with the pitchy wood we burned throwing off tons of sparks. The fact that the handle is directly above the flame might not be the handiest design, but I'm not sure where else they could have put it.This unit looks nice just sitting out on my brick patio but it looked really great with a fire burning.After the first fire the outside of the copper tub has turned the most beautiful oranges, yellows and reds. It really does look beautiful just sitting out on the patio."
972,769,5,I'll be honest... I'm far from a green thumb. I ordered this product because my plants get dusty and I thought it might be nice to not just clean off the dust but give them a bit of shine. I really had no idea how important it is to the health of a plant to keep the leaves clean! This product sprays easily onto the leaves with a targeted mist and is easy to wipe off with a cloth or even a paper towel. It left my plants looking beautiful with just the right amount of shine. I love knowing that my plants are so much healthier now as well! Excellent product!
539,561,2,"I put the machine together and got ready to test.  I have some banana trees and the leaves fill a garbage can real quick.  I put one leaf in and turned to get another.  When I looked back the first leaf had disappeared.  Where could it have gone.  The adds say 11 to 1 compression.  Not banana leaves, more like 100 to one.  I have a lot of fruit trees and I use grass clipping, leaves and tree trimming for mulch and fertilzer.  This works great.  You should see the size and quanity of my fruit.  I had a schreder and mulcher before but I put orange branches in it and that was the end of my Black and Decker schreder.  Black and Decker did not support the repair.  It broke the bearings and burned up the motor on my B&D; unit.  This machine goes thru stringer line kind of fast when used with  branches.  But Home Depot has new line rather cheap compared with buying that line that comes with the machine.I bought a garbage pail and put it under the machine.  It collects my schreded stuff and allows me to spread it around the gardern.EDIT:  After using it for a while I have found that this thing is usless for anything but small jobs with leafs only..  The slightest twig will break the leading strilng cutter.  The training string cutter will just break itself immediately.  The 13 inch string folds in two.  See the illustration in the add for how it is assemble.  I tried larger string (comes with .080 and I tried 0.095) and found no difference in performance. If you have much work to do you need to go to HomeDepot and by a large spool of string.EDIT 2:  I  called the company and asked for help.  I asked it there was some way to add a steel blade. They said no. My leaf eater should be renamed string eater. I tried steel wire and it cut beautifully for 15 seconds and then the wires dissapeared like the string.  The customer service at the company stated my leaves are to strenous for it.  Or may it is not suitable for my work.  I tried tying the string together where it comes out of the center disk and it helped a little but not much."
477,337,4,"I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me."

1267,712,5,"I'm not sure what is so appealing about mealworms, but whatever it is, it's making my chicken who love me, love me even more, and making the chickens who are scared senseless of me think that I am the best thing in their world...EVER!  This stuff should be named ""better than sex cake"" for chickens!  It's that crazy - all my chickens love this stuff, the dog loves this stuff, and heck - if I would let my kids eat it, I bet they'd love it too (bugs are cool to a 4 year old apparently...no, I did not let them eat it).  The price on Amazon is also over HALF the price in any pet store.  I just bought a bag today at a pet store because I didn't want to suffer the wrath of 12 little beady eyed terrors because they didn't get their hit today, and I paid $12 for a 7 ounce bag.  Argh!  Definitely going to order some more right now...gotta make sure I've got happy chickens to get happy eggs!  According to my hens - HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!"
1012,387,5,"I'm a big food Network fan and my favorite guy is Alton. What I saw on one of his shows was the most awesome advice for this device. Take ONE, that's right, ONE piece of newspaper and sprinkle a few drops of vegetable oil on it; then put it under your chimney starter (outdoors, please, eggman if you're reading this) and fire it up with a full can of any kind of charcoal. You won't believe how well this works. One more thing; DO NOT set a chimney starter on a gravel driveway when you start it. For some reason, the heat transfers much easier through gravel than concrete. Just put the thing on your grill grate and wait for 20 minutes. You'll have smokin' hot coals that will be almost too hot for smokin' food. I even saw Alton searing tuna on top of one of these things.Follow up:  Use two pieces of newspaper that you ball up and light.  Works great!"
1187,787,3,"It telescopes out, but not much. To make the cutting head parallel to the ground, the handle/battery has to be about two feet from the ground!! This makes it uncomfortable for a large percentage of the population.I would lose the telescoping feature, a waste of money, and instead have a swiveling cutting head so the user doesn't have to bend over all day to keep the head level. It also needs the front handle to be adjustable up, in addition to the fore and aft adjustment it has now.Seriously, I may rig up some sort of  handle extensions.Why not just return it? Well, it is a good trimmer.I have a big, noisy and vibrating gas trimmer for my bi-annual full yard trimming, one that takes all day. The Toro is the no-excuse device to do the weekly little trims when the wild grasses in my rural yard are growing fast.The Toro trimmed this wild grass, almost 8 inches tall and wet from a shower, probably around 300 square feet, quickly and without drama. Even some errant tough-stemmed ground cover was dealt with nicely.I thought the single small diameter cutting string would just not be enough and that the motor would bog down, but it didn't. It all cut well and quite quickly really. All this only seems to have used maybe 25% of the battery! Pretty impressive. The string did not jamb and it seems to feed out at a decent rate. I thought it might fly out fast in order to sell more string, but it is fine. And I used the long-string option (you can set it so the string is cut off shorter, thus lowering the load on the motor and saving the battery).You obviously slide into heavy wet grass slowly and nibble at it a bit more than you would with a landscaper's gas unit, but I think the Toro would be fine for most residential yards.I do not have a need for the edging setting, and cannot comment on its use, but it seems well thought out for what it does. It would seem that dedicated edgers would be better for that perfect, professional cut along the circular drive and around the pool..."
78,500,4,"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with this at first but it&#8217;s one of those products that just grows on you. It&#8217;s made from galvanized steel tube bent into shape and welded with end caps to clean up the holes and mounts with two screws.I was disappointed because the finish was not that great. The photo shows one that is pretty much polished metal while the actual thing does not look polished at all and has some kind of material identification number markings pressed into the metal in a couple of spots.  It also didn&#8217;t come with any hardware. So you have to source your own screws/bolts or whatever you plan to use.That aside, I did hang this up on our redwood fence. We had some suitable screws with largish size heads that fit the two holes. Our fence was screwed rather than nailed so it was no problem to screw this in. It only took a couple of minutes and the long double stem that has been welded provides a lot of support as well as being wide enough that the hanger does not rotate from side to side.The 50 inch hose hung well and the curvy shape of the hanger and the fact that it&#8217;s at an angle means that it&#8217;s easy to take the hose off without the hose getting caught or tangled.ConclusionDespite the finish being a bit industrial looking up close, it is a sturdy piece that matches our galvanized fence posts. So in my case it doesn&#8217;t look at all out of place. Plus you can&#8217;t really see the blemishes unless you&#8217;re looking for them.  And our backyard looks a lot more organized now without the hose lying heaped on the ground next to the patio.All in all, I quite like it."

1574,904,5,"Pansies are heavy feeders. They are plants, as you probably know, that need a stead stream of nitrogen. And my problem in the past is that I start out well, giving the little transplants their food, but then I get distracted and don't do the follow up feeding they need.This GreenView GreenSmart food will fix this problem. It gives plants a dose of nutrients it can use right away, and then it has a slow release component.As for odor, I thought it was mild. It smells like fertilizer but not stinky.  It's also not dusty. The texture is like grounds, not pellets, and it is easy to work into the soil.I'm happy with it. Been feeding my pansies and azaleas with it. No signs of 'burn' with the pansies.

786,640,5,"I have a couple of cheap cage suet feeders like this:Heath Manufacturing S-1-8 Single Hanging Suet Feeder.  They're inexpensive, lightweight, and they get the job done.  The problem is that unwanted animals like grackles and squirrels have no problem dining endlessly at that type of buffet.I am very impressed with this Stokes suet feeder.  The very first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was its heft.  It has some weight to it.  The cage wire is a bit thicker than the standard inexpensive suet cages.  If you look at the additional picture I uploaded, you'll also see that the actual square suet cages are attached to the bottom of the feeder with thick wire supports. The top is also thicker and more rigid than the stock picture might indicate.  Likewise, the metal screw cap securely holds the top in place with no worries about stripping the screw post.  The hanging ring is thick steel.  The ring is squeezed into--or captured in--the screw cap.I'm not sure what the ""double locking closure system"" is that is referred to in the product description.  The only closure on this suet feeder is the top which is then held in place by the screw-on cap.I'll add visitor statistics as time goes on.  So far, I've had a hairy woodpecker dine with little difficulty.Edit:  After a couple months of use, I've noticed regular visits by flickers, red-bellied woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, downy woodpeckers, and hairy woodpeckers.  It does a fine job of keeping fox squirrels out, and large birds like grackles struggle on it sparingly.  The biggest downside so far?  Opossums or raccoons learned easy access to the suet cakes and devoured two full cakes overnight.  It looks like I'll still need to put a pole baffle in place in order to keep the four-footed critters off."
42,941,5,"And of course priced to match! But you'll be amazed that a 50 ft hose fits in the tiny box it comes in.the cutoff valve for where you hook up to the spay nozzle is a great idea, so you can change attachments without going back to turn off the spigot.Feels strong. Black allows it to soak up heat so you have a bit of hot water at first, nice for washing down garden tools or topping off a swimming pool.I let the water out and left outside during a freeze night and it was fine. Would not recommend keeping it connected to fixtures though.Time will tell how durable it is. But as of now, this is SO much nicer to work in the garden with than a 50 ft rigid hose which is hard to control, gets muddy, and ends up crushing plants!"

744,285,3,"For the most part, I really like this fire pit, but there were a few drawbacks.Pros:1. Assembly was really non-existent.  The copper bowl just sits in the legs and, viola, it's assembled!  I have another fire pit that required legs to be screwed on, handles to be put on, was missing screws, etc., so this is a big bonus.2. The hammered bowl is beautiful.  I didn't have any issues with dents in mine at all.3. The entire fire pit is bigger than I thought it would be.  For some reason, I expected something smaller in diameter and was thrilled when it arrived and was bigger.4. LOVE the cover.  It has thick elastic and it big enough to tightly cover the entire copper bowl.  If take care of, this will eliminate the water getting into the bowl which is a big problem I've had with other fire pits.5. It is heavy, in my opinion, which makes moving it around hard, but will also keep it in place when the wind blows.  I'd rather have it stay in place!Cons:1. I agree with those who said the screen didn't fit perfectly.  It's almost like either it or the bowl aren't completely round.  I can make the screen pop into place, but for the price, this should be an exact fit.  I read the other reviews complaining that the screen rusted.  I haven't had the pit long enough to see if that is an issue for me or not, but I'll update if it is.2. I wish I had come with a poker.  Again, for the price, the user shouldn't have to buy an extra accessory to tend to the fire.Overall, it is a very beautiful fire pit and would be a great addition to any patio.EDITED 6/9/2013I changed this from four stars down to three.  The weather finally got good and I was able to actually use this pit for a fire.  While it worked perfectly, it is no longer a pretty fire pit.  At first, I thought all the discoloration was because it needed to be cleaned out, but after a thorough scrubbing, it looks awful on the inside and outside.  I added a photo for you to see, but it's in the main photo lineup."

1155,827,5,"Although you may find its price and application process a bit frustrating, this Gronomics product is a prudent choice for at least two important reasons.* It is a blend of vegetable and citrus oils, all of which are safe if they come in contact with your food. Until I found out about this product, I'd resigned myself to the ""gently weathered"" look for all of our wooden planting barrels and raised beds. This healthy choice led to periodic and perennial frustration, because between sun and rain and year-round use, our tubs and beds took a beating that required repair and replacement.* This product is developed and distributed by the manufacturer of a line of upscale cedar garden planters. Thus, it stands to reason that this formula has been created to add to the appearance and performance of cedar planters and tested to ensure that it does provide protection and does not have long-term negative effects on the wood.Application is pretty straightforward, as long as you budget for sufficient time and patience and have a couple of basic tools on hand. The tools I used were a sturdy nylon brush, a large rectangular plastic food container (similar to the semi-disposable Ziploc containers), and a 3-inch paint roller. Because the container and the roller sleeve came in contact with the Gronomics oil, I wanted to use items I could dry and discard safely and following combustibility guidelines. Here's how I prepped and treated a new raised Gronomics bed and a relatively new barrel planter.On the first day, I made a weak solution of Dawn dishwashing liquid and water, and used a sturdy nylon brush with grip handle to scrub my newly assembled Gronomics planting bed. I also emptied and hosed out my barrel planter, and took the extra step of rinsing the interior with boiling water before scrubbing the exterior with the soapy solution. I then rinsed both planters with a pressure washer to ensure all soap residue was removed.On the second day, working in a shaded area, I poured about an inch of oil into the food container and dipped my paint roller into it. I applied two light coats rather than a single heavy coat to reduce drips and spills. I also portioned out relatively small amounts of oil to avoid wastage; same for using a roller with relatively low nap.I applied a coat to the inside of the Gronomics bed, just below the level to which I planned to fill it with dirt. However, I left the interior of my barrel untreated so I would be able to compare its rate of weathering to that of the treated exterior of the barrel."

944,229,5,"I managed to trap 8 squirrels in 2011 with havahart animal cage (Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Chimpunk, Squirrel, Rat, and Weasel Trap). See my previous review of havahart animal cage. They were attracted to the bird feeder on my neighbor's backyard. It was a way to catch humanely. They have been ""relocated"" to a much bigger park where they can search more food and harass small birds. This year I have a difficulty catching the newcomer squirrels. They do not respond to the tasty peanuts that I put in the trap. I am not happy to find some spots here and there that have been dug by squirrels. So I pour this critter ridder around the garden and in the container. It works. The squirrels hate the powder so much that they do not touch my garden anymore."
11,700,5,I took a few plants and turned them to many using this...my garden looks great
1668,753,5,Works like it's supposed to!  My hydrangeas are a gorgeous blue!  Thanks!
1066,178,5,"I've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs.  I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago.  It chewed up branches up to 5"" thick easily. Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount.  This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2"" socket wrench and a little common sense.  I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating.  If you're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more, otherwise it's really handy to have around.  I can't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way, of course that's probably not something you want to emulate."
345,397,5,Best grill i've had for camping or for home.I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
518,905,5,"Awesome product.It arrived just in time for a major yard cleanup as we had just had a nifty autumn windstorm and the 50 gazillion leaves on our trees (we back up to woods) all fell at one time. When they fall in the normal way the gods intended - over a few weeks, gently, in a nice even layer - they can be mulched by the mower. But this year, those buggers held onto their trees with all their little might while the cold weather got closer and closer and my poor hub cursed them for holding out on him. Finally, he had to winterize the mower.Five days later, the mother of all Fall wind storms rolled in and - Whomp! - leavage.So we got out the rakes and called the kids to come over and help (I promised chicken and dumplings for dinner afterwards.) The raking actually went pretty fast, but we had some HUGE piles of leaves. They set about bagging them and this cool tool really helped! We filled 9 bags which would have been maybe 15 without our &#34;leaf foot&#34; ... well, the kids and the hub filled 9 bags while I made dinner and played with the grands. Rank has its privileges.Bottom line is, this leaf packer-downer worked like a charm and no one had to use their hands and get covered with dirt and leaf schmutz. And when the leaves were packed and the bags lined up for the recycling truck, the grandson had quite a bit of fun making Bigfoot tracks in the soft soil next to the woods and we all got to help him &#34;fool&#34; his Mom into thinking that Bigfoot had walked through there. She was a good sport although we're not sure she didn't really believe it."
143,553,4,"I got this insecticidal 3-in-1 spray for use in and around my vegetable/flower/herb gardens.  The spray did an excellent job at eliminating the caterpillars from my collard plants.  Whatever was eating my sprawling mint has also disappeared.  The spray also did an effective job at reducing the black spot and leaf spot on my roses. Of course, roses will need repeated application of the product.  I did a general spraying of the other vegetables and flowers in the vicinity. However, as one reviewer pointed out, this spray is best used against visible pests, not as a preventative.I usually have an infestation of whiteflies and aphids by now, but I have not seen them this year, so I cannot comment on the usage of this spray to control those pests.  When they do appear, I will test the spray against them as well.The only downside so far is that my green beans seemed to get some leaf damage from using this product.  Also, I wiped out a tiny (4 leaves) watermelon plant that sprouted from seed.  I would not use this product on young/new plant life.  Other than these minor issues, I have no complaints.  I will also add that spraying a large area can be tiresome and probably wouldn't be suitable for someone who has arthritis.I give this product a green light for general usage around the garden, in flower beds and in herb gardens.  The organic formula should lessen worries about the use of harsh chemical pesticides."
1671,442,3,"I like these timers because they're inexpensive and easy to use. Unfortunately when it comes to watering devices, there's no market for truly durable and long-lasting stuff - it would be too expensive - despite the complexity of controlling water at high pressure in a challenging outdoor environment. Hence the mixed reviews and disappointment for most of the watering devices sold here. (But would the same folks pay two or three times as much for better gear?) These timers are no exception. One in four or five is defective, and after two seasons' use, they leak like crazy. But given the price, they're an OK deal.  You just have to assume they'll need replacing every other year."
1644,167,5,"I live in a rural area where deer abound aplenty.  Every year there is a battle to see who can win- us with our plants and gardens, or deer with their insatiable appetites.We have been using Liquid Fence for quite a while with great results, but after a while of pressing the trigger over and over and over, it gets a bit tedious considering our garden and elderberry bushes are pretty extensive.This version of deer repellant is a bit different.  The square container is about the size of an antifreeze container.  There is a black cap that screws on top and a hose the comes out of it.  There is a sprayer nozzle that attaches to the hose and that has batteries in it.  The actual repellent is human safe so it can be used on gardens safely.It does tend to not have the severe garlic smell that some people find repulsive with Liquid Fence, but more of a calm scent which still does the trick.We just planted our garden this last month and that is when the deer often eat off all of our plants. We have been using this repellant and so far nothing has touched our plants.Application is a breeze.  I just press down the nozzle and out comes the stream.  I can make it softer or more precise and harder depending on what I need.  My application time is cut way down now and I can quickly tour my yard spraying every week and I am free to spend more time on other things I would prefer to do.I highly recommend this stuff. It is wonderful.  So far, no rabbit or deer problems with our garden and believe me there are plenty of both in our area.  A few times of raining a week and it still works with weekly spraying if we have some serious rain."
493,458,5,I bought this last year and used it on one house of mine in the late Fall.  Went up on the roof with a sprayer and sprayed the roof.  By this Spring the mold was all gone.  Between the snow and rain it worked gently and cleaned the roof.  What went down the gutters did no damage to my lawn or rain barrel water.  I just bought this container for a second home with the same issue.  I sprayed it on it last month so we'll see what Spring brings but I am sure it will work.  This second home does not have gutters so this will wash onto some brick steps with the same mold problem.  I am hoping it cleans those also.
22,17,5,Very convenient and easy to start seedlings.  They are sturdy and I have reused them more than once.  I recommend these.
1464,351,4,"The funny thing about this birdfeeder is that out of the 5 I have in my yard, this is the only one that still has birdseed in it after a week.Now I can't tell if its because the squirrels can't get to it or because the birds don't particularly enjoy it either, but it works to keep seed in there longer!I have seen it in action, the squirrels try to hang off it and eat but cannot. We have it on a shepherd's hook so there is nothing else for them to hold on to while eating. I have also witnesses some pretty big birds on it, too, eating without a problem.The birdfeeder itself is fairly light. The metal is thin and the inside is made of plastic. My only concern is the squirrels who get desperate enough might gnaw at the plastic and render it useless as a deterrent.It is super easy to fill and while the rubber hanger seems fragile, it has held up in plenty of storms and birds, so I suppose its good."
645,761,5,"This is a very well built, heavy duty mole trap.  It is easy to set and the concept is a good one.  We have not caught a mole yet but are very close.  My husband set the trap right over the mole tunnel as instructed.  He said he thought it might work a little better if it were a tad wider.  The mole ran into the post part of the trap that is underground and went to the left of it instead of in between...LOL!  He got lucky that time!  I am sure this trap will catch the moles that we have because the principle of the trap is very sound.  I like the fact that the sharp parts are under ground where pets and children are not at risk of the trap.  The spring is also very heavy duty, with a lot of power and durability.8-15-2013Just wanted to add that this product has done its job very well!  We did get the mole and it works well!"
1015,307,5,"I've used Havahart live animal traps, as well as other major brands, for over 25 years in a rescue-spay/neuter program for feral felines.  I have traps ranging in size to accommodate squirrels all the way up to dangerous predators like coyotes.Some of the traps on the cheaper end of the scale are made in China.  They weigh less than the USA-made traps because they use smaller gauge wire and are not as sturdy.  I bought one just for comparison.  They are not durable for the long term and the bite of a strong animal can actually bend and break the welds on the wire.There are some very good traps that are made in Wisconsin which I've used for years.  However, I've had to adjust the trigger mechanism with bent-nosed pliers to get the tripping weight exactly where I wanted it.  They are like setting an old-fashioned booby trap but they are sturdy and dependable traps.I like traps with a release door on on the opposite end from the trap door.  Unfortunately, this design requires the trapper to stand directly over the door to open it and release the animal.  Some animals are dangerous when frightened and squirrels can bounce faster and further than one might expect. I once released one squirrel that immediately bolted, did a 180&#730; and bounced off of me before I could move.  The back claws are sharp.  Many times I've wished I could be standing a few feet behind the trap when releasing an animal.Havahart must have heard my wish. The Havahart Easy Set Trap is exactly what the doctor ordered and I am sold.The operator does not have to stand directly over the trap to open it as with other brands.  Simply tie a cord to the handle, stand back behind the trap and pull the cord.  One slight pull disengages the lock and opens the door and the critter scrambles away to freedom...and you are safely out of harm's way.In case you're wondering, the animal can NOT disengage the lock from inside the trap.The Havahart Easy Set Trap is the easiest trap on the market to use.  The one-hand operation is great.  You open the door with one hand and the trap is set.  The tripping weight seems to be adjusted perfectly for the size of the trap and animal being targeted.I use a car-wash brush to scrub down my traps after each use and then rinse them off with a water hose and they're ready for the next use.WARNING:  Do not release any animal that appears sick or injured.  Call animal control in your area.  In most regions, 911 will contact animal control for you."
56,403,4,"As long as you know that it will suit your specific needs, I think this is a nice product. It's quite large in circumference, but low in height, so it's perfect for a low-burning fire you spread out so several people can stand or sit around it. Just be aware that it's only a ring with no bottom, so you need to have an area cleared for it on the ground. You can't use it on the grass, for example.They call it portable, and technically it is, but it's more practical for use on your own property. If you do plan to take it camping, it's best if you're going to stay in one place for awhile. Putting it together and taking it apart multiple times will get tedious. It's fairly easy to put together. Just be sure you have all the bolts in place all the way around before you start tightening the nuts. Otherwise it's hard to fit the later pieces together.The metal seems quite sturdy, but it has some sharp edges, so be careful if you have kids who want to help. Also keep in mind that everything's going to get sooty with use, so assembly will get messier over time."
1627,337,3,"If you live in an area where you need a large capacity feeder to keep your hummingbirds happy, it's hard to imagine how this feeder would not suit your needs. That said, I did see comments on a review where the person said they have several and are still refilling daily! This feeder was made for those situations, but sadly, those of us that do not have swarms of hummers in their yards will do more dumping of unused juice.Assuming that your situation is the former, and you need 1.5 quarts of juice to keep your hummers happy, you'll find that the plastic cylinder is very easy to clean. It has a wide mouth that makes thorough cleaning a snap. However, the base is nearly impossible to clean properly, as the liquid fills the base, with the recessed areas very hard to reach and clean effectively. If you have any liquid in the cylinder when it comes time to clean, have a place to drain quite a bit of liquid out of the base when you tip it over or take it apart in the sink.In the four weeks that I tested this feeder, I did find that the ruby throated hummingbirds we have here did use it without any issues. Our birds are very territorial, so we never get more than one at a feeder at a time. I was really hoping that the number of ports on this feeder, and the fact that we had six feeders spread around the yard at one time would encourage more birds to be visible at once, but that didn't happen.Just recently, I have found that getting the cylinder to fit into the base is more difficult; almost as if it is going slightly out of round or something. It's not a big deal, as it just takes some patience to put the pieces together.Filling this with 48 ounces of sugar water means that it's going to have some weight, so a sturdy hanger is a necessity. Fortunately, the metal hanger at the top of the cylinder is up to the task. I never had a concern about it breaking and falling, but the shallow clearance requires a proper hook so you don't have to tilt the feeder. An added plus is that the red cap with the hanger screws off the cylinder, which has a flat top, so you can fill the inverted cylinder while it stands on a counter and then screw the top on to hang it. Having these separate parts makes replacements possible as well so heavy users should have some options in that regard.Durability doesn't seem to be a problem, as it was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about three feet, and all that happened was that one of the feeder port flowers popped out. It snapped back in without any trouble, and nothing else cracked or broke as a result of the bouncing it took.Overall, this is too much feeder for many situations. But for those that need the capacity, this is one of the few I've seen that will hold this much juice. While the base is a little unwieldy when it comes to cleaning, I'm not sure there's a better way to build it and still serve six ports with this much juice. If it weren't for the hard-to-clean crevices in the base, I'd give it a solid four stars."
811,167,4,"Since we live in the country, we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at, they can do a lot of damage, and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer ""trimmed"" all our shrubs, even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year, we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife, and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden."
384,489,1,I put this out this spring when the wasps began visiting our garden. They flew around and totally ignored it!Not recommended.
1610,487,2,Nozzle works well but doesn't have some of the spray patterns I like to use.  Will by buying Dramm in the future.
1116,292,5,"So nice and clean, it makes my birds happy to eat  this brand I have had many brands and nothing compares to Wagners Seed"
1250,196,5,"Deer are not a problem for our garden but rabbits and in particular squirrels are. We have raised beds but it doesn't slow either rabbits and of course not the squirrels down. I sprayed this around the base of the planter boxes and although I cant say for sure it has stopped every varmint from crossing, it certainly has made a big positive difference. It will be interesting to see what the duration of the effect is."
274,255,3,"The problem with these products is that you can't ever really be sure it is working. We used it according to the directions and have not seen any new tracks on the ground. We assume that it is working but it is hard to tell for sure! As of today we haven't seen new activity since we put the bait into the mole holes, 3 weeks ago. I will continue to use this as long as we don't have new tracks, because I assume it is doing what it is supposed to do!It does not work on pesky chipmunks, we still have those running around wild, they ignore the bait."
15,762,4,"First impressions review.We have always used threads or thin ropes (compostable) to tie plants and saplings to stakes. It worked fine, gives stability to the plant and allows it to grow freely without getting choked.These plastic clips appeared to provide a similar function without having to work with thread and scissors. They do. These are flexible (do not choke the growing plant) but firm and don't let the plant dangle without support.In addition to supporting the plant, the clip can also hold other things like tags and labels if needed.It is easy to fasten and unfasten which makes me wonder about its durability in the hot sun. I get the impression it will expand and unfasten since the 'lock' is not tight. I will be using it for patio plants, indoor plants, and those that get afternoon shade in the outdoors.Unintended additional use: It can also be used to attach lights to vertical pickets of a staircase."
536,925,4,"Like the similarly shaped bird feeders by the same company, the Perky Pet Top Fill Bird Waterer is easy to assemble; it'sjust a matter of attaching the six parts together via the diagram (which was inside the middle cylinder part in my package).  The top part has a hook already attached, and there is a bottom tray type part which allows the birds (and likely other small wild critters) to perch.  According to the instructions, the holes allow rain to come through and collect, after being filtered and holds up to 64 ounces of water.So far, it has stayed on the tree outside my window without a problem.  The Perky Pet Feeder I had tended to bobble around a lot in a strong wind, but since I will be using this during the summer, that probably won't be an issue.  Since the standing bird baths I have had tend to collect dirt and need to be tipped regularly to prevent mosquitos from breeding, the hanging feeder should be a good alternative.  Hopefully, the birds will continue to think so, too, especially mid-summer which tends to be extremely dry in New England where I live."
1685,789,5,"This Fire Tub is simply beautiful. It is 100% copper it is not too large but not too small (26""w  23""h with spark guard cover and the height without spark cover is 14 1/2""). It looks very nice in our deck. Even if we never used it to burn wood in it, just by itself is a beautiful decorative accent.Please keep in mind that this tub is all metal and when you burn wood or charcoal the entire thing gets really hot. So keep your distance and use some type of glove if you have to remove the spark cover to add more charcoal or wood."
100,918,4,"We live on the prairie in rice country. We rejoice when the winter gets cold enough to give us just a little respite from the mosquitoes. It is no exaggeration when I say that these are mosquitoes that drill through blue jeans, folded over socks, and sometimes even mesh on tennis shoes! So, clothing does not work to protect from mosquitoes. Obviously, neither does every insect repellent.Cutter Backwoods Dry WORKS! We have worn it while exercising or working in the yard around dawn and dusk, both horrible mosquito times. The only places with bites were places we missed with the spray.The &#34;dry&#34; claim is definitely accurate as well. I love the fact that it is easy to forget that I have this on because it truly does dry quickly. Also, the smell is not overpowering. When I hug my repellent-covered kids, I only get a faint whiff of smell rather than an overpowering nose full.The only reason I won't give this five stars is because we have not tested the ten-hour claim. We know it has worked for two to four hours. If I ever find that it really does work for ten hours with our mosquitoes, I will come back and amend my review without hesitation."
1126,584,5,"I bought this to replace a Chapin sprayer which stopped working on me.  I've only had this sprayer for less than a month, but so far it's great.  Easy to assemble, carry around, and use.  And it works for surprisingly long after pumping it up.  If it lasts, I'll continue to be a very happy customer.  Only time will tell."
317,105,5,"We've had a dozen of those cheap portable charcoal grills that either don't cook worth a darn or fall apart after a single season.  This one definitely won't be doing that. Very sturdy, good quality grill - quality we expect from Lodge. I have a feeling this is the last portable grill we'll ever have to buy, and it's a good thing because these are getting harder and harder to find.We BBQ throughout the year and this is perfect for the deck and porch. Mind you, if you're looking to feed the family and guests in your backyard, you need a bigger grill, but if you're camping or just grilling up a chicken, steak, or a couple burgers - this is absolutely perfect!  While the price of cast iron has sharply increased recently, if you take care of (see below) this grill, it will actually save you money over the years.NOTE:  This is made out of cast iron. If you don't know how to care for cast iron, you need to search the web for (easy) instructions on how to &#34;season&#34; cast iron. It takes time and anybody CAN do it, but if you're lazy and won't WANT to put the (little) effort into it, please DON'T buy this - you won't be happy.  DO NOT throw it away if it shows signs of rusts  - give it to lover of cast iron and they'll put the effort into it to fix it up - and they'll love you for the gift!"
371,499,5,"I bought this for our Webber Q220 grill. As another user said, the double prong skewers are worth it alone. I have never seen skewers such high quality. The rack is nice if you don't want it to stick to the grill. I looked at the other ones out there, including the one for $10 less with 1 more skewer by Weber. The double prong makes this set worth buying."
1573,68,5,"I ordered these little brushes to clean my hummingbird feeder, but you would be amazed at how useful they are around the kitchen and around the house. They fit into orifices and crevices when nothing else will."
828,310,5,Been using this for years and it is great stuff. Only issue is it dries up in a couple of days so you need to refresh the area.
927,197,5,"This trap works and is large enough to trap cats and possums. The animal can be freed in two ways: opening the end with the slanted solid panel OR opening the opposite end, which is secured with a wire and requires more effort. Using the easier way (solid panel) means that you must hold that end open; it's the end that closes to trap the animal. The other side is the one you open to put the food in. The directions state to put the trap standing longways to open this end, then turn it upside down to get the animal out. Other than this, the only way to release the animal is to use a stick to prop open that side. I had an issue with the possums being too afraid to walk out, so I propped the side closest to the trap mechanism open with a stick and left the cage so the animal would eventually leave. (Trying to dump the possum out was an option, but they are very good at clinging to the wire frame of the cage, and I didn't want to hassle it out.)The only thing you should know is that you might have to bend the long rod that sets the trap off; bend it to make it ""shorter"". This is because the rod is too long (as least mine was), so stepping on the trigger plate did nothing at first. Bending the rod a bit then testing setting it off is the way to fix this, otherwise the trap won't work. I uploaded an image to show how I bent mine (top of page, click view customer images).For cats, I used pieces of sardine on top of a slice of bread (to keep it off the ground). This worked for a cat and two possums. I'm only trying to catch cats, but the possums are a problem because they seem to find the trap and get caught in it. So, if you're trying to catch any cats, don't release the possums because they will just come back again and drag out the time it takes for you to catch the cats. I think the possums have more a snout that catches the odor of the sardines, so they're quick to get caught.Another thing: if you are transporting the animal in your vehicle, you should put sheets of newspaper under the trap because the animals might relieve themselves in fright during the ride.For cleanup, I would suggest bringing the trap to a car wash that has the high pressure nozzles."
81,272,4,"I have had this feeder about 6 weeks now and made several observations:1. It is well made, sturdy, tough, all metal zinc plated steel and will likely be very durable.2. Large capacity - holds 2.5 pounds black oil sunflower seeds requiring fewer refills.3. Easy to refill through large door on the top, without taking the feeder down.4. Cover or roof on top offers some protection from the rain (if it's not blowing).5. So far, not getting as much attention or use from the birds as my other feeders  but of course the birds are accustomed to the older feeders.6. Some reviewers complain the openings in the mesh are too small and birds can't get the seed out.  I am undecided about this but I doubt it is the case because if you shake the feeder some seed will fall out and through the mesh onto the platform.  I can say for sure there is less waste due to spillage of sunflower seeds compared to my other feeders- a big plus.7. I only wish it was available in a selection of colors.  I would prefer a more natural less gaudy color such as dark green, brown or black.  For me, the show is not the feeder, the show is the birds."
1099,515,5,"I have searched for a reasonable way to store and pour gasoline that is both CARB compliant and spill-proof. This can is the closest I have come to realizing that goal. The nozzle on this can allows good flow control, specially when transferring gas to a small gas tank (as one would find on most small engines).I am impressed! This can works! It is worth the money and time to invest in this gas can; I have no regrets about purchasing it AND I am finally happy to comply with CARB."

You will no longer need lighter fluid to get the grill going.Simply roll and put two sheets of newspaper at the bottom of the Rapidfire Chimney, fill it with your choice of charcoal, light up the paper and place the whole unit inside your grill (without the grilling rack). Eight to ten minutes later, the coals will be red hot with evenly distributed fire. The simply grab the chimney by its handles, pour the coals into the grill, set your grilling rack and start the party.Of course, as with any flamable material, caution should always be used when handling. Even though its handles do not get very hot, they'r still warm, so I recommend to always use gloves. After you have emptied the chimney, place it away from children and any inmediate area where the risk of burn exists. It will be extremely hot. Do not use water to cool it down, it might warp the metal; allow it to cool on its own.The quality of this item is superb. After countless uses, it's still holding strong and works as when new. Compared to cheaper versions found at local super markets, this is by far, the best I've used. Its design allows for plenty of oxygen to flow through, allowing the coals to burn evenly and rapidly. Once you use it, you'll never go back to the old fashion way and in no time, you'll be saying goodbye to lighting fluids."

41,189,3,"Directions say limited success in rural areas with bigger deer populations..I agree.  Actually had deer walk right by the stakes when they had only been out 1 day and the ""acorn scented"" lure did nothing in attracting them.  Trying to insert cotton balls into the very small holes on the stakes were nearly impossible. What does work well is the little shock that you do get if you touch the top of stake.  Of course, then you would have to wait awile for it to repower to shock again.  On that point alone it would work on the deer. What we are going to try next is just putting all the stakes in a line to try to keep the deer from entering the area we're trying to protect.  If you have any experience at all w/deer, you know there's practically nothing they won't try to eat so you need to always think ahead when you want to plant all those pretty flowers and bushes!"
1391,767,4,"This is a single block Tomcat bait trap that will kill up to 12 mice.  It's not a trap that mice will be trapped in, but rather one that they will go into to eat the bait and leave.  It's rather hard to see how much they've eaten at this point in time, but when the block is gone, the trap can be disposed of.  The bait is enclosed in the trap, but the top is clear plastic and it will be easy to see when it needs to be discarded.  Apparently with ingestion of a very small amount the mice will die within a couple of days, but not in the trap itself.We do have pets and obviously we don't want anything around the house that can inadvertently harm them.  These are ""Kid & Dog Resistant,"" but if you have your doubts, take a pass and continue using the old Victor traps if need be.  I've even used the electronic method with some success.  I'm not going to be using any of the Tomcat Mouse Killer traps in any accessible place in the house, but rather in my small barn.Field mice usually are more problematic in the fall when they are heading to shelter, but manage to be busy throughout the year.  I'm using the Tomcats outside.  I do like the concept and like it much better than the d-Con I've tried in the past.  They came in a box and just seemed to attract more mice than they eliminated.  I also was concerned about how the poison seemed to be spread all over the place.  Not enamored with that method.I'm not quite sure how the Tomcat Mouse Killer system will work in the long run, but I definitely like the system.  I will not be using it in any place where animals or children will have easy access to it at all.  My comfort level isn't high when I take any chances, which in the case of bromethain I'm not planning on it.  Better system than the open-boxed d-Con I've used in the past, but how well it works in the long run remains to be seen."
1605,742,2,"I believe a table should have a solid top.  This one does not.  The manufacturer did put a slim (about 1/16"" thick) piece of hard and brittle plastic on the underside of the weave.  My table arrived with a 6"" jagged crack in that plastic.  I do not see that the plastic adds to the support of the table top.  My 5.5 pound cat walked across the table and created an indent with each step she took.If there were stemmed wine glasses on the table and someone put their hand down and leaned on the table the wine glasses would take a tumble.Besides the unstable table top:  The weave is not always straight with the edges on all sides.  The color of the fake rattan does accurately match the other pieces in this line (at least the one other piece that I have).  The feet are brown-paint-coated aluminum and are anchored well.  The packaging has been improved (since the piece I received last month), in that the spots in the box where the feet hit are reinforced.  The table arrived in good shape because it was packed properly, so don't be afraid about the shipping of this item.UPDATE May 4, 2012:  Found a good use for this piece of furniture:  It is very useful for hiding things.  It is so light weight, just lift it up and store unsightly, but necessary patio/outdoor/pool stuff underneath.  We took a lid from a plastic tub and set our bug sprays, glass cleaner, plant food, etc. on the lid, then put the ""table"" over it.  If this piece of furniture had a sturdy top and a lid, I'd give it five stars...."
97,129,5,"I received this very large box via UPS and couldn't imagine what was inside. Unlike most things today that ship in parts in order to spend less in shipping but, consequently, may not be built as well in the end.  While the main photo shows the front, the sides are equally as big and it's nothing short of adorable.These are not cheesy plastic parts that will weather and crack. This is made of sturdy metal and the roof of the house is like a metal barn roof with a galvanized steel look.The weathervane is also metal and cut but polished with no sharp edges, just as a large one would be.The perch is made so that if birds sit on it it stays open, but anything heavier, like a squirrel, will close the opening.You have a door and windows to further taunt said squirrel to get to see the buffet closed for business until he can starve himself down to bird weight...aww, such torture, Mr Squirrel!The metal bar that holds the feeder is tough and meant to stay in place on a branch without ever breaking away.Truly a well made and adorable piece, sure to delight all the birds that can line up on the perch and feed together, and sure to torture unlimited squirrels......fortunately for them, I also have a squirrel feeder.  Werd."
124,251,1,"Safer Brand Ant And Crawling Insect Killer, like any insect killer, is not that safe for humans and pets. It's main ingredient is Silicon Dioxide. Should you squeeze this super fine powder anywhere in your home- just remember breathing this dust, even in small quantities, over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis or cancer. Children, the elderly or anyone with lung issues should avoid this completely. This fine dust becomes lodged in your lungs and continually irritates them, reducing your lung capacities. If you don't know anything about Silicon Dioxide, it's used for making glass fiber strands, among other things, and depletes water upon contact- thus drying out and killing the insects.I personally would never spray this super fine dust in my home, as who wants any health problems that could arise from silicon breathed into your lungs?  I'm sure it's safer outdoors, but I prefer those little metal ant discs that work well. The ants go inside, take the bait to the nest,  feast and die. I have found over the years that sealing up my home as best I can and dumping buckets of soapy water around the house works wonders. I never waste anything- after we wash the cars, the sudsy water gets dumped around the house. Soap, especially ammonia- makes bugs very ill. It won't kill them, but they'll find a better place to live after getting sick enough times. If bugs are a real problem, I'll use a liquid killer over a powder, as I can always wash my hands, but I can't wash out my lungs. When I read the label saying Avoid Breathing Dust and Wear A Suitable Dust Mask, I knew this product is not suitable for indoors and definitely not for me."
469,933,4,"This is a far better design than my previous Perky Pet feeder as all the plastic parts detach from the glass.  The instructions tell you to hand wash with soap and water twice a week.  Being lazy and in order to test it, I ran the whole thing through the dishwasher on the top rack.  The glass was fine.  The perches got a little bendy, I probably will not send that part through again.  Because these things need to be cleaned all the time, and it&#8217;s hard to get into the little crevices in the flowers I wish it was dishwasher safe. However,  een if you have to hand wash, it comes apart easily for cleaning but you will still need a tiny brush to clean out the holes.  I LOVE that you can stand it on end to fill, this is a huge plus, no more trying to hold the feeder in one hand and fill with the other.  The flowers also have a little tube that sticks up on them, this does seem to dissuade the bee&#8217;s, but not stop them altogether.The ant moat is too shallow  to be effective here in New Mexico, after three hours all the water had evaporated.  I hang my feeders from plastic bell shaped hooks (type plastic bell ant guard) anyway because all the water moats I have ever tried dry out too quickly.Within minutes of hanging this feeder  (replacing a Dr. JB&#8217;s feeder) there was a black chinned hummingbird partaking.  My usual standby feeders are the Dr. JB Clean Feeder, because they hold a LOT of nectar ( I have one that holds 80 oz) and they can been thrown in the dishwasher.  However, they are much more expensive than these feeders, more than twice as much.  I had both hanging up for a day and did not notice any difference in which one they chose.  I would post a photo, but it appears that we cannot do that anymore.Here is how I make nectar (that red stuff is not supposed to be good for the hummingbirds and it costs too much).  I use a plastic bottle that juice came in (like cranberry juice) onto which I have sharpied a line which is one quarter of the volume (this makes a sweet solution, you can also do one fifth).  Fill up to that line with sugar.  Add very hot water (not quite boiling) leaving a little air space, the water that comes out of my faucet near my hot water heater is actually hot enough.  Put on the lid and shake.  Faster and easier than boiling up a solution every time.  Store extra in the frig.  You can even run the juice bottle through the dishwasher to clean it between making nectar."

946,674,5,"For reviewers who have moths but none in the traps, my first thought is to check what kind of moth is in the house.  Flour moths zero in on these traps quickly and when the traps start to fill up it's a bit startling to see how many are in the house. That said, I don't rely on the traps alone.  All our cereal products, flour, sugar, raisins, etc. are stored either in Ziploc bags or in sealed Rubbermaid containers (available on Amazon) designed for the purpose.  Even products that seem as if they're sealed well in the original packaging--oatmeal for instance--are vulnerable to these creatures."
617,96,5,I have a lot of aquatic plants outside and was worried about the pots becoming a mosquito breeding ground.  I sprinkled this in the pots and haven't seen any little squirmies.  The bits are the best way for me too go as I didn't need a whole &#34;dunk&#34; for each pot and that would end up being expensive.  I also sprinkled these bits in an area where I found some water had leaked leaving a temporary swamp.  No skeeters there either.
729,527,3,"This is a very attractive hummingbird feeder.  The glass bottle is cast to look like an antique bottle and has a red coating to attract hummingbirds.  The bottle screws into a grey plastic base with a brushed-copper-look top with red metal florets.However, as I was given this to review for the Amazon Vine program and it is a product that has been launched over a year ago, here are my observations based on previous comments and reviews:1) The glass bottle is still coated in red coloring, it is not made of red-glass.2) So far after 3 handwashings, the red coating has still remained intact. I will report back if the coating flakes or peels as mentioned in other reviews.3) The base of the feeder is a hard grey plastic that has so far remained intact with no cracking.4) The top of the base is a brushed metal plate with metal florets where the birds are supposed to feed from. The edges of the metal are slightly sharp so care must be taken when washing.So far I love the look of this feeder - especially the way the colored-antique-look glass catches the sunlight. It looks much better than my red plastic feeders.I will report back if there are problems with peeling or flaking that previous owners of this feeder have experienced.A solid 3-star for looks. Stars were taken off for the use of coated glass instead of actual red glass and the sharp edges of the metal disc."
862,341,4,"I was hopeful that it would keep the Racoons away from my sweet corn patch. However one of the Racoons leaned up against it while the rest of the family had a feast on my corn. Ya gotta get up pretty early to match wits with a Raccoon. Those critters are smart. They know how to get over an electric fence by the jump and climb method. Playing a Radio constantly to scare them away does not work, they dance to the music and ignore the commercials. I am going to try a laser show next, followed by a motion detector water cannon.  I will let you know if any of this works. It isn't that I love corn, it is the challenge of out witting a Racoonn!"
1557,102,5,I bought one of these to try in my greenhouse. Also bought the hydrofarm MTPRTC digital thermostat here on Amazon. Great pair together. I put this under the starter tray and the seeds sprouted in no time.
1038,923,3,"This feeder does not hold much food, so I found after trial and error that it worked best using Niger seed. Using that kind of seed, I was able to attract quite the flock of Goldfinches this way...of course a few hours later I attracted quite the flock of squirrels. They don't seem to be bothered at all with the baffle on the top. It just gives them another way to show off their agility.I don't recommend this feeder to be put close to any windows because even a mere breeze sets it to swinging and I'm afraid that it might do some damage.I also want to let you know that it really isn't that easy to put together, especially if you have a touch of arthritis or something else that affects your finger tips. I have severed nerves in my finger, and holding on to the bolt was difficult for me. The directions are not all that clear nor as helpful as they should have been."
490,810,3,This is a spray that you hook up to your hose and then apply to your lawn.  It doesn't kill the moles just is a repellant.  It basically tries to get them to go to someone elses yard.  It did work a little but you would have to keep applying and I am not sure how long one application will last before they start coming back.  Would definetly get something that kills them and keeps them from coming back.
489,167,4,"Living near the woods, we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, racoons, and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog, so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients, and so far seems to repel the critters, though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing, an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good, but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted."
122,867,5,I don't have a problem with indoor insects as long as I spray around the perimeter of my house.I like the Terro Insect killer. After using it I've noticed few insects and spiders around my home.There were certain spots that they would always return to. Shady areas and around my garage door was always one of their favorite spots.The Terro sprayer was easy to use. The spray nozzle is adjustable for wide or narrow spraying.I would use this product again.
1481,137,5,"Don't even bother buying another hummingbird feeder.  This is the best.  It's easy to clean and refill.  And the built-in ant moat works great.  I bought the smaller one last year, and the hummers LOVED it.  So I upgraded and bought the larger one for next spring.  Now I'll use both in separate locations so they don't fight over it."
826,55,3,"Changed from 1 to 3 stars. 'Worthless' was initially noted, as the YJ's often walked in and just walked back out. It will trap some initially, but later catches flys AND hornets. The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging."
1574,403,5,"The first thing you need to know is that this is a fire 'ring' and not a fire 'pit'.  There's no bottom, so you can't use it on a deck, nor on anything you don't want scorched by a raging fire.We however, have quite a few areas around our property where we can use it.  And right now it's set on packed earth.  Later I plan to haul it down closer to the creek so we can sit out and toast marshmallows and hot dogs on sticks-- and possibly drive away a few mosquitoes.INSTALLATION was a breeze.  The four segments came wrapped in a box, along with 12 bolts and 12 nuts.  I took the pieces down to the our little natural area, stood the 4 curves pieces up and then nutted-and-bolted them finger tight.  Could not have been easier.Now some people might want a solid ring, but I definitely think the 4-piece arrangement is better.  For one thing, it will be easier to store during the winter.  And for another, we'll be able to disassemble it and carry it to campsites where I plan to use it to create a better fire/not fire boundary at the established sites.Nice rustic appearance.  If you are looking for a fire ring there are various artistic motifs to choose from."
1049,167,4,"We feed birds, so the yard is loaded with impy squirrels who get into everything.  Every year I plant gazanias--carefree colorful flowers--and every year squirrels decimate them.  Nothing is actually eaten; plants are simply left in tatters.  You'd think after all these years I'd give up trying to plant them, but fools never learn.We've tried other deterrents without success.  Squirrel Stopper is totally ineffective.  This year I opted to try Havahart Deer Off II and guess what?  The gazanias live and thrive (not one nibble).  It's been weeks and still no sign of squirrel damage anywhere in the garden where this has been sprayed.  The same can't be said about areas sprayed near bird feeders, but that's okay because I have other squirrel deterrent methods at work there.  My primary goal was to stop garden destruction.  The gazania test is definitive proof this product really works.I can tell when neighbors are using deer/animal repellents because the odor is so pungent.  Not so with Havahart Deer Off.  Its smell isn't noticeable, and the battery powered sprayer sure is easy to use.  That may not suit everyone's needs, but Deer Off comes in a variety of concentrates and sprays.  Overall, I am very happy with results, and it's so nice to see gazanias blooming again."
1277,709,3,"The idea behind this product is nice: a wet-dry vac and pressure washer in one. The implementation, however, is horrible. Cords are everywhere and poorly controlled. I would greatly prefer to have these as two separate and independent products.This is my first/only pressure washer. Hadn't used one before. It works fine, and I'm somewhat impressed with the device. The added pressure certainly helps clean things, though I'm not sure it's that much more useful than just a hose with a nozzle in some situations. With the pressure on and a straight beam of water, I can carve my initials into the concrete in my driveway (don't ask how I learned that).It wasn't hard to put together, though the instruction book isn't nearly as straightforward as it could be. Basically, install about a dozen screws to get everything together (the handle, mostly).What was incredible frustrating was trying to wind the cords up and get them in place, especially after use. Rather than have a top and bottom anchor for you to wrap the cords around, there's only one on top, leaving the cords to flop around wherever they want to. Which, if not coiled absolutely perfectly, is everywhere. On both sides. One side is the high-pressure water hose (stiff and rigid, this is the cord that goes everywhere), the other side has the power cord. Both could have used a lower support. Incredibly stupid not to include one.Then there's the small wet/dry vac that sits on top of the whole contraption. I didn't have one, so thought I'd be killing two birds with one stone by getting this product. Anyway, there's no place for its cord to go either, so you just coil it up and hope it stays in place. I do like the vac though, it's a nice small size, with plenty of suction. Handy. I'll probably use that more than the pressure washer. So they'll end up living in separate places anyway, and don't need to be nested like they are.Anyway... to sum up: each device works fine. Cord management is the worst I've ever seen for a product. Having the vac and washer as two separate items would be more logical."

540,105,5,"One of my friends received this as a gift to use for tailgating parties.  After a few uses, he decided it took to long to cool off, was to hard to clean and had put it back in the box with the intention of setting it out with the trash!  Fortunately before he did, he saw me looking at it on this website and asked if I planned on buying it.  I said yes and he said don't because he had one that he was going to throw away.  If I didn't mind it being used and a little rusty, I could have his.  I took it.  It was rusted but I scrubbed it, oiled all the parts, and seasoned it in the oven (it was still cold outside so I couldn't fire it up)!This little grill came in so handy when we bought another house in the spring and removed the stove to make way for the new one. I cooked on it everyday.  What my friend found as a disadvantage, I found as an advantage, it stays hot for a long time!I grilled everything, half smokes, kabobs, burgers, chicken, veggies, fish, etc. . . and nothing stuck!  I also grilled ribs on it.  I sliced them into individual ribs, placed them on the grill, and covered them with foil (crimped the foil around the rack with tongs). They turned out really good. I used my little cast iron skillet on top of the rack to scramble eggs, and blacken steaks (lots of coals needed for that).The grill is very durable and as long as it is properly taken care of will provide many years of grilling pleasure!  I really like it because the grill rack can be put in the sink for easy clean up and as long as it's properly seasoned, I don't have to worry about my food sticking to it.I also have a 22"" weber kettle grill that I use when I want to grill a lot of food or large items.  If I don't, I set this one inside of it on the grate and use it instead.  This is an excellent grill for a small household, and I recommend it over the other hibachi type grills.  It's great for camping but keep in mind that since it's cast iron it takes a long time to cool down, so start grillin' early!"

1492,672,5,"I can no longer handle the standard trimmer with all the cord. By the time I got it all unwound to get to the back of the yard I was too tired to use it and then all that winding the cord around the arm leads to almost fainting. This is a Godsend. It is light enough for me to swing it back and forth and it does a great job. No tapping to keep the sting advancing. The battery lasts about 20 min and that is all I last and in fact am allowed to work in yard. Getting the 2 batteries is great.My only problem was putting it together The black shield was hard to get in place by myself but I finally did. I got a pack of the pre rolled string which is quite handy when they empty I will keep them wound with less expensive by the big pack thread. I am still on the original. I have used it quite a bit and even to cut down foot high grass so the yard can dry to be mowed.Great product. I have now ordered the hedge trimmer that is 18v, no more cutting the electric cord."
1419,471,5,"It works very well.  I found that it killed ants.  (They were living in my potted plants outside, so I put it under the potted plants.)

Water pours from the nozzle much better than any plastic model off the shelf, I will give it that.The wire carrying handle, with the cheap little plastic hand guard is just that....cheap, cheap and flimsy.  After one season in the sun the plastic will get brittle and crack for sure....I've already duct taped mine to make a more useful hand guard with a bit of cushioning.Why didn't I return it?  I should have....it most certainly is NOT worth the money, but I'm stubborn and too lazy to shop for another watering can.  (How odd that I will gladly haul water back and forth on 2 acres all day, but the effort to shop for a better can just seems too daunting.)"
644,449,5,"I imagine the people giving this product low ratings either a. don't have clothes moths and expect it to catch all kinds of moths, b. didn't actually put the pheromone in the trap (you have to open the package and drop it in that hole in the top), or c. didn't read the package to see this only traps the MALE clothes moths and does not kill the larva which is what actually eats your clothes.First off, the type of moths that eat your clothes are very very small and very very fast. They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps."
1412,89,5,I have tried both dry and soaking in water.  Jury is still out on that one.What I can tell you is flavor is noticible.  Chips are much easier to work with in reference to Weber's E670 smoker box.  Chucks would be more appropriate for charcoal or homemade tin foil smoker bricks.Tried Charbroils version from HD.  Will continue to be buying Weber's version.Purchase again?  YES
430,449,3,"This is essentially a hanging glue trap, I don't think it's going to solve your issue by itself, and while it's true there are no chemicals to use the ""glue square"" really isn't that large so you can only use it for a short period if you have a large moth problem.It will work to ""catch"" the moths, but it isn't going to be your one solution, cure all."
1025,396,3,"I'm giving this a 3 star because it has worked well for the last two years. It was a rough start & full disclosure: it may have been at least partial operator error. I bought this as a gift for my Dad (who does not live close enough for me to come see the problem). He bought an adapter to use his regular size grill gas tank with it & even seemingly tight fit, it would not consistently work, which was very frustrating for him.  When I learned he hadn't been able to use it, I visited, reviewed everything & followed the troubleshooting tips, still with no luck.  We bought a second adapter, which also did not work, so we assumed it was the grill. After speaking with several people about it from Weber, the local hardware store, etc., eventually a third adapter was purchased & the grill has been fine since, but as we were told by the company, it is designed to be used with a small tank and if you're planning on using it with a big tank, be prepared for possible issues as when adapters come into play, it opens the door to possible problems as the item isn't being used in the way it was designed for premium usage."

1485,514,1,"In order to be prepared for whatever nature threw at us, we set up the Mosquito Magnet quite early in the season.  Right from the beginning, we got a red warning light, signaling that the unit wasn't working.  We tried to clear it but nothing seemed to work.  Next, the Magnet signaled a low battery warning.  Since they were new and advertised to last the season, we were a bit taken aback but my husband removed and tested them.  Sure enough, they were fully charged but reinstalling them didn't help.  He substituted other new batteries to no avail and then he called customer service.  The woman to whom he spoke was quite pleasant but unable to provide any solutions.  At one point, after he explained that our device didn't exactly resemble the pictures in the literature, she suggested that perhaps we had been sent an earlier model as if that sufficed to explain its failure.After the call, he once again removed the batteries and decided to wait a few days and try the trap again.  The green light came on and we thought it was working but after going through two cycles with the attendant replacing of the propane and the lure, the Mosquito Magnet which is unobstructed and situated just a few feet from our patio area, has caught pitifully few insect pests and our yard is no more mosquito-free than it was before we set this up."
1103,807,4,"This inline booster fan is an easy to install addition to help increase airflow in long runs of central heat and air duct-work. The fan comes with no instructions, but how to install it is pretty much self-explanatory. Of course, you'll have to run an electrical line in your attic to provide power for it, and it would be best to have it controlled by a relay switch controlled by the main air-handler so that it only receives power to run while the main air-handler fan is running. The fan itself is a bit on the noisy side, it would not be an issue in most industrial settings, but in a quiet home the drone it makes will quickly become annoying as it travels through the ductwork and makes itself known in every room of your house."
18,572,5,"Perfect simple spray nozzle.  Nothing that has to be gripped, or held on, which can get very tiring if you are watering a large garden.  It's simple to adjust this nozzle from a fine mist, to full spray, to forceful patio wash.I connected this to my Gardena hose and it works perfectly, but the included Quick Connect allows you to snap the nozzle on and off any garden hose."
1422,167,4,"We've used Deer Off for a couple of years and I was happy to get this bottle from the Amazon Vine program.We have a young orchard (apple, peach and cherry)and the deer love to rub their antlers on the trunks, meanwhile breaking off branches and even killing the trees.  They also love eating the fruit.  Deer Off keeps them away, although we have to spray after every rain.I have several birdfeeders, and the squirrels tear them up over and over.  Deer Off keeps them away without keeping the birds away.  It's so nice to have birdfeeders last more than one season!This product doesn't work against raccoons - evidently they love the nasty smell because they continue to get in the garden tear up the corn.  We haven't had any rabbit damage so I can't say if it works against them.I like the handle in the bottle, and the spray hose, but I wish it were a manual pump.  I didn't find the battery power necessary to spraying.Overall this is a great product that humanely repels deer and squirrels."
1192,63,5,"After I started having trouble with a sore knee, I go this to help me in the garden.  It's lightweight so easy to move around the garden, holds my tools, and is perfectly sized for me to sit on while weeding, planting flowers and everything else.  It has really saved my knees a lot of wear and tear and I am finding it super-convenient for storing my tools.  It even had a holder for my water bottle.  It's great!"
470,592,3,"I have been using this product for a few weeks now and saw a reduction of ants, however there is an area around a vegetable garden where I still see a lot of activity. After a few rains you can still see some granules. Overall a good product but definitely needs a long term review to show true effectiveness."
1571,788,4,"The first thing I noticed when I took this feeder out of its packing is that it's fairly heavy and quite sturdy. It's also somewhat elegant looking.Filling the feeder, I was surprised at how little bird seed was spilled. When I filled up the feeder (with wild bird seed), only a few dozen seeds fell out. (I should add that in order to remove the top, you have to squeeze a button on the cord. I'm not sure why that's there since I've never had problems with similarly styled feeders without the button, but I suppose the top will stay more secure. Perhaps this point is of concern to people who have squirrels that steel from feeders.) I'm used to losing much more than that from my other feeder. Then I hung the feeder under the eave of a porch and watched to see what would happen. The regular feeder stayed up, about three feet away.The birds favor the old feeder by about a two-to-one ratio (based on the amount of seed they have eaten). There are a few possible reasons for this preference. The first is that they're simply used to the old feeder. Another is that the old feeder (which is about the same size) has a ledge all the way around it, allowing multiple birds to alight on one side. I've seen as many as seven birds there. The new one, as the picture shows, has only a single bar on each side, allowing a maximum of four birds. The third possibility is simply that it took the birds a little while to figure out that the new feeder is indeed a feeder.The end result, though, is that they use it well. I do have two concerns about the feeder, though. The first is that it is, even without the seed, rather heavy, and it needs a sturdy support. My porch is sturdy, but if I were to try to hang this from a tree, I might have problems if I could not access a strong branch. The second concern is that the birds' access to seeds seems to have the potential to serve as a trap. When a feeder runs low, birds get greedy, and I've had to rescue one bird that got its head caught in an old feeder (one that is no longer in use, and the bird was fine since I discovered it soon after its predicament arose). This one appears to have that potential, and I shall have to keep a close eye on it, at least for a while.If my fear materializes, I will update this review."
807,387,5,"Webers Charcoal Starter has to be the creme de la creme of charcoal starters. They are of a very sturdy build with safe and well made handles! This one won't fall apart on you while handling hot coals! Had one of the el cheapo's and the wood handle came out of the metal straps holding it in place. Spilled coals all over the ground and lucky I did not get burns on my legs. If you got a cheapy....throw it away for safety sake!The funnel/cylindrical shaped coal grate allows for very fast start up of charcoal and as some others have stated, put a couple of drops of vegtable oil towards the top on crumpled newspaper! Helps make for a hotter and a tad longer burn to get coals going! Neat Trick!!!!"
53,622,5,"Yeah, well you'd be feeling vicious too, after seeing the damage these slimy crawlers do to your garden.This is a great non toxic solution, similar to Sluggo, but it will have to be reapplied after a heavy rain. Which is when the slugs come out. Too expensive for a large area, but perfect to hit problem areas in the flower bed orcontainer gardens. For large gardens, beer traps would be cheaper."
154,62,5,"This Rotisserie is too expensive, but on the other hand it's well built, and does a great job. I bit the bullet and bought it on sale. I'm very pleased with it. I've had other rotisseries for other grills. And while they all do the job, the Weber seems to just float along effortlessly. The motor seems to be well built, and strong. Another reviewer said Weber isn't making this any longer. I have heard that elsewhere as well. It's the perfect match for your grill, so don't wait if you want one. I've done Chicken, Roasts and Pork loin on it, all came out beautifully tender and moist. Once you use this, you'll never make beer-can chicken again. I use it with the Weber charcoal pans for indirect cooking. A match made in heaven, or where ever the Weber factory is!FYI.... I have an old ""Universal fit"" rotisserie from an old grill. I found that the basket it came with, and the meat forks fit well on the Weber spit. Also, the motor fits on the Weber bracket, and the Weber spit fits into the old motor fine."

1058,267,5,".This is a review for the new model Havahart Trap with these dimensions: 32"" long - 10"" wide - 12"" highIMPROVED:SAFETY FOR YOU: Having used these traps from time to time over the years, I can safely say that the Easy set/release is a tremendous improvement. If you are using one of the older style traps I'm sure that you will appreciate the safety and convenience of this improved model.SAFETY FOR TRAPPED ANIMALS: Havahart seems to have done a good job on de-burring the interior of the trap in order to keep trapped animals from wounding themselves needlessly. As some animals get pretty frenetic when trapped, this is a humane improvement that is especially important if one plans to relocate/release the animal.PRO:Proven, reliable, durable design - now improved!New one-hand door mechanism is a great improvement.Widely available. [It's a Havahart]Good instructions included.Bait recommendations included.Lightweight.CON:I wish Havahart would put a small door on the bait side of the trap so that it isn't such a long reach to place the bait. As the trap is designed now; and has been previously, it is a long way to reach to place bait all the way at the other end of the trap from the door!POTENTIAL PROBLEM:Our trap arrived with two of the rubber caps that are on the ends of rods missing. I assume that they were jostled off in shipping and I hoped they were still in the box but they weren't. One was missing on the ""axle"" for the trap door; the other for one side of the connecting rod for the bait tray.IMO, this is a problem that Havahart would be wise to remedy - and that should be easily done by putting a small drop of some kind of appropriate adhesive onto the rod ends during assembly.CONCLUSION: I priced a similar-sized trap at the famous Asian tool importer and this improved design - with safe, one-hand handling and mostly burr-free interior - makes the traps there obsolete. This is the one to get for the long run."
1217,464,5,"I bought this to make sure I didn't over water my dwarf kumquat plant. It works great. I ended up using it all spring and summer for my tomato plants, raised beds, and other potted plants. Very helpful."
176,853,3,"I'm not really sure what this is good for, except starting seedlings and maybe growing very shallow-rooted herbs.  The containers in the planter are exceptionally small and very shallow, meaning that you cannot plant anything like basil, rosemary, or anything else that needs more than a few inches of dirt.  I gave this to a friend to use for starting seeds, though, and she really liked it.  So just know what you need this for and plan accordingly.  I would not recommend planting a windowsill garden in this, although the design is really nice."

522,420,5,"This comes in a very BIG box with lots of packing paper.  There is a clamp with two screws that you first attach to the pole, the black skirt goes over and simply sits on clamp (the clamp does NOT attach to the skirt), and you push the edges together until they interlock. I was surprised that it moves or can rock a bit, so if a squirrel somehow tries to climb up on the thing from another structure it tilts even more making it tougher. The idea is, they are stopped from climbing up the 'pole' and it does that easily.  If they figure another way to jump on your feeder you can't blame this.  It's not magic, it's a pole block to the critters.There is a big paper label but I carefully pulled it off without tearing it. A little heat (hair dryer?) might make it easier.I did spray the top of the skirt with silicone spray, it may not be needed and a car wax might be worth trying later.One thing I noticed since installing it, I have more birds at the feeder!  I think perhaps it blocks the view to the ground and makes them feel safer (just guessing).  So far no bird has even tried to land on it.I'm a new 'birder' and I'm starting to wonder if there is no end.  I started by tossing seeds on the patio... LOL"

201,765,5,"My wife and I are retired and, without giving ages, we're not too new to that status. So, we do not have the strength or stamina we used to have. We have a 25' x 50' vegetable garden. At the time I knew we were getting this, the garden was in need of having the rows weeded - badly. So, we waited to weed it until this arrived. Unlike last year, this year's garden has gotten off to a grand start. Of course, when the veggies are growing well, so are the weeds.The assembly is simple and takes a 10mm socket wrench. An adjustable wrench could do the job, but the wheel assembly would be tougher with it. Each part went together smoothly and the instructions were about normal for these days and were sufficient. All parts seem to be well made and there were no rough edges. Total assembly time was about 20 minutes and I wasn't trying to see how quickly I could do it.Our garden was well tilled a couple of months ago and has only had spot work done other than what was necessary for planting. We have been using the Black & Decker cordless tiller (linked below) for small jobs - it does great for it's intended use, also. So, this first use was a harder test for this tiller than subsequent use will be, unless we get really lazy.There is a removable weight box that calls for the addition of dry sand. I tried this with no sand and the tiller worked quite well. Both my wife and I could use it easily. I next filled the weight box about half-full of sand. It did make a difference in usage, though the added weight made it more difficult to use, especially for my wife. I filled the box the rest of the way and noticed a small difference in how easily it tilled deeply, but not enough difference for the added weight.We both love it, though the sand needs to be removed for my wife to use if for very long and the sand only partially added for my use. For someone younger than us, the added weight with it full would not be a problem. It never becomes as laborious as a regular gasoline powered tiller. I even tried it on an area that had never been tilled and it worked just fine. Of course, I had to go slower to go through the heavy grass and compacted soil. I would recommend that the soil be moist without being muddy. We tend to spot water and parts of what we tried this on were a lot softer than others. Obviously, it was easier to get through that which hadn't been compacted so much by being walked on.It works great in doing what it advertises. The adjustable items (depth, width) are easily changed. The blades are easily removed to clean off the grass and weeds that get wound around the axle. The on/off handle is the least well designed feature of the tiller. It is a spring loaded feature so the motor will shut off automatically when it is released. That feature is great. Getting it out of its slot and then in position to use takes some getting used to and could have been better designed. This is not a deal-breaker, though, and not major at all.As with all corded lawn tools, staying out of the way of the cord is important. Planning a route to keep the cord out of your way and also away from the plants is worth the time. I had a corded electric mower for decades and got used to it. We have a large yard and needed 200' of cord to reach the area. Trying it closer to the house produced no difference in how it ran.We have already used this for over two hours, and got the garden weeded. Since we won't have to use this again for a few weeks, I wanted to go ahead and post my thoughts. If future use brings up anything (plus or minus), I'll update this.This is so easy to set up and use that I'm sure we will stay on top of the weeding more than we have. Those are the types of tools I enjoy having. I hope that won't require the sand in the weight box. I also hope my wife doesn't read this.Bottom line: Due to the size of our garden, I won't use this to do the spring ground breaking, but I will use it for the large maintenance of it (and the battery one for the smaller areas). If I was putting in a small garden, I would certainly use this for everything. Unless the soil is particularly full of clay or rocks this should work just fine.Highly recommended by both of us.Black & Decker GC818 18-Volt Cordless Electric Garden Cultivator"
763,912,4,"This is a quality-build product and arrived securely packaged and in great condition. The hardest part of the set-up--no real ""assembly"" is required, other than putting on the ""wings""--was finding the appropriate propane cylinder in the dead of winter locally. Once that was accomplished, and the cylinder screwed in, the unit started with just a few pops of the ignitor and heated up quite quickly.We cooked burgers and chicken breasts for our test run and both turned out just as well as on our full-size Weber. The surface area is plenty large for 4-6 of each, and we easily fit 4 burgers and 2, smallish breasts on at a time, and it was a perfectly usable height on top of a granite picnic. After cool down the unit was fairly easy to clean and seems perfect for an RV, boat, tailgating (our likely use scenario) or just any small space use-case (apartment, second home). Also useful to have on hand if you're normally a charcoal griller, but occasionally want a quick, gas grill backup.All in all, I was impressed by the power this compact unit provided. It's a high-quality grilling experience in a small package, offering the convenience of a gas grill without the usual, bulky footprint. It also seems to built to last, versus less expensive, but also far less sturdy, portable options."
1564,757,5,I purchased a high priced timer last year which didn't meet me needs because all of the watering times were fixed and not flexible. With this unit you just set it and forget it. Works great and super affordable price.
606,758,5,"We had a little friend get in the house and while we wanted him out, we didn't want to kill him. This mouse trap was perfect! We were able to catch him, and then release him back outside. We got rid of the unwanted guest and he lived another day. Great product!"
242,944,4,"My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn't nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6"") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9"") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole"
464,893,5,"This is not your typically lopper tool. Fiskars put alot of thought into this product. Even before you open your package you see the craftsmanship detail that went into them. You hope your first impressions last as you open up the package - and it does, and surpasses it. These are very strong yet lightweight. They are made of aluminum alloy handles and they have handle pads made from cork to provide a comfortable grip. I 100% love this feature. Its not only comfortable to use, but also adds detail and style to these pruners. Best of all it comes with a lifetime warranty.These are idea for pruning tree branches up to a 2"" diameter. The steel blade is 100% rust-resistant. Fiskars has a patented non-circular gearing mechanism multiplies leverage for up to three times more cutting power than single-pivot tools. We have other tools just like this one from other brands and after trying these out, our others are collecting dust. There is a huge difference when using Fiskars. I never realized it until trying these. They are just more powerful, lighter and comfortable to use, and get the job done with ease. They are totally worth their value."

Make this unit a even better value.2 pieces solid brass design with o-ring should last a life time, once a while should open the nozzle to clean out the water corrosion. We got very bad hard water in Southern CA.

1472,209,5,"This is one fine hunk of metal.  Sturdy.  The paint or whatever is both attractive and seems durable so far.  Maybe I&#8217;ll update this review in a decade when this unit has had a chance to weather.The amazing thing is that I can be so happy about something so simple.  So much of the stuff I buy seems designed to break.  This isn't.  I should make an entry in my will for it because it&#8217;ll outlast me.I&#8217;ll be getting more stuff from Yard Butler, as the needs arise, just to see if they make everything this well.  It&#8217;s so hard to find quality these days.Other than its sturdiness, there&#8217;s not much to say.  It&#8217;s a hose hanger.  It works.  Did I mention that it&#8217;s sturdy?"
249,331,3,I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that have found a way into our home. I set it up last night and sure enough shortly after I went to bed I heard the SNAP! Dead mouse. Unfortunately this trap is a pain in the butt to set. There is a little plastic hook that holds the metal spring down and it just doesnt want to stay. After playing with it for a while I manage to get it to hold but I do wish it was a bit easier to set.
112,684,5,"I recently bought a new smoker, and this was the first accessory that I got to go along with it.  I absolutely love this thing.  It allows you to keep a close watch on your smoker temperature and your meat temperature while you're inside doing other things.  The alarms also allow you to get a good night's sleep even when you're doing an overnight smoke.  I get teased about carrying my baby monitor around, but it works wonderfully.  It costs a bit more than the earlier version (ET-73), but they made some important improvements that make it WELL worth the extra expense (mainly the much improved transmission range and putting the transmitter's on/off switch on the outside instead of inside the battery compartment)."
1465,944,3,"I have a 6-year old corded mower from Home depot's own brand. It still runs fine, but its all metal construction makes it too heavy for moving around on tight corner during mowing. So, I am interested in trying out the light-weight corded mower from B&D.;Assembling the mower body itself is pretty easy, but putting together the grass collector box is quite a task that requires some handyman skills. Frankly, I think it's a design flaw. You need to assemble 4 pieces of hard plastic shells together to form the grass collector box. The process involves lining up several tabs for snapping them into the matching slots. But the tabs are not aligned and the plastic shell is pretty stiff to adjust. So, some brute force effort is needed. In a nutshell, it's a painful process to put together the grass collection box.This B&D; corded mower is far more lighter as it uses a lot of plastic material. It has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle bar for storing extension cord. Not sure if I want to dedicate a 50-feet cord just for this mower though.I try this mower couple of times. Though it's very light and quite, I know something is not quite right. It took me a while to realize the balance of this mower is off. The plastic shell construction make's it very light on the front deck. The long metal handler, plus the grass collecting box have quite some weight. When I run this mower, I keep getting into the condition that the front deck rises up. So, I end up having to intentionally hold the handler bar a little upward to prevent that from happening. Things are getting worse when the grass collecting box is half full, as it adds more weights and it is even more easier for the front deck to tip upward.One more thing that I don' t like this corded mower: the handle height is not adjustable. For me, the handle bar is a bit too high. On top of that, I have to intentionally hold the handle bar upward to prevent the front deck from tipping upward. So, after the mowing, my hand feel tired.At the end, I still go back to use my 6-year old Home Depot brand corded mower. I won't recommend this B&D; corded mower."

1104,312,5,"I had the black washer in my garden hose and spray nozzle that came with them when purchased. They both leaked, so I purchased these red ones. They stopped both the leakes and I've not had any leaks from either one. I'm very satisfied, so far."
123,946,5,"I recently purchased a B&D; 40 volt lithium trimmer and then was offered this via the Vine program. Since we have a 2nd property, I jumped at the opportunity to try this one out. As might be expected, it isn't quite as powerful as the 40 volt version but otherwise, is very similar in function, weight and appearance. I should also add, I've been putting the 40 volt to the paces and have been impressed by what it manages to handle. My first day out, I used it to trim everything between a bunch of fruit trees in a lot that was overgrown, thick and full of weeds. It cut grass, weeds and even underbrush like a pro. Amazing!So, as I mentioned, this is not quite as powerful but assuming you aren't using it to take down swamp growth but rather an average lawn, it is more than sufficient. The charge takes about an hour (max) and seems to last 30 to 45 minutes. The string does not require a bump which is nice and last through the entire trim without worry.Weight is not problematic although it is not skimpy like some electric versions. The battery is interchangeable with other B&D; products of the same voltage (a very nice touch). The entire machine is adjustable up/down to fit short or tall persons. There is a guard on both the front and back to protect self and plants.Overall - great tool. Can't believe we waited this long to try out cordless trimmers but will NEVER go back now that we have!"
1070,553,3,"This product does what is says it will do.  I like the fact that it is all natural. I try to buy organic, so why would I want to use pesticides on the food that I take the trouble to grow?All in all, I am satisfied with this product."
988,167,1,I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck. I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and it seems to have no effect on the squirrels.
971,530,1,"I have used this product twice. It works well and the battery charging is fast. The edger function did not work well for me. It could be the type of grass in my lawn. Overall a good product and very ergonomic.This is an addition to my review above and a few months later. I reduced the rating for this product to one star or perhaps 0 stars. I have used it no more than five times since I bought this a few months ago. The battery just died and could not be revived even after several attempts at recharging for the specified time and more.I will stick to known and tried brands next time I buy another weed whacker.This is an addition to my review above. I was ready to throw this weed whacker when I saw the worx website on the warranty card. It has a two year warranty. In the worx website was a link to battery trouble shooting. After I put in the battery's serial # and model # I was taken to a free battery replacement order form. It seems to me they know about this battery problem and is replacing those thru their website. I am waiting for the delivery of the replacement battery.Another addition to my review. Have received the battery replacement and so far after several weeks, the new battery is keeping it's charge."
302,781,2,"I have an almost 100% organic garden and yard and overall I don't have that big an issue with weeds (I use a lot of black plastic mulch in my veggies, for example--you'll never see weeds again), but I have a few areas, like my patio, where they are just out of control. I despise the thought of adding any weed-killing chemicals to my yard for many reasons (I eat a lot of what comes out of my yard, I have a lot of wildlife that has a hard enough time surviving, I worry about harm to pollinators, etc.). But again, for a few areas, I thought this might be a potentially good idea and actually Preen came highly recommended by a local landscaper. After reading the label and precautions, however, I decided to ONLY use it far away from any area where food is grown or where pets might roam (I would not want my pets licking this off their paws sorry).The primary place that I wanted to use the Preen was on my patio which is made of pavers (like 8 x 12&#34;); the weeds grow like wildfire in the cracks between the pavers and it make me nuts. Since no other plants grow there I thought it might be safe to use. The trouble in using a powdered form of Preen, I found, is that the stuff just bounces off of the pavers and there' no way to make sure it goes in the crack. So, that's no fault of the product or spreader, but that experiment was a failure.I did find a few border areas that are largely gravel (weeds seem to love gravel beds) where I tried spreader and it worked (as far as distribution) fine. But since it's still early spring here in New England, I have no idea whether or not this stuff will prevent any weeds. I tried to use it *very* sparingly because, as I said, I have no desire to bomb the yard with any chemicals. The thing is, the power spreader actually does work and you can go through a $25 jug of this stuff PDQ (which is the source of my headline above). What a clever idea: add a battery-powered spreader to make sure that you're blowing through the stuff quickly! Give that guy a raise.Overall, while I can see the convenience value of this to someone who doesn't mind using a weed killer in garden beds and who has no pets, but for me, I felt guilty using it. I think I'll go back to yanking the weeds (or using vinegar to kill them). I don't like the idea of hurting wildlife, I think many weeds are good for the pollinators whose populations are declining, I don't want poison in my yard and this stuff is way too expensive. I would never buy this product, sorry. Please, before you buy it, read the labels and the warnings. If you have a gravel parking area or some other non-natural place where weeds are an issue, perhaps this is a safe product. But in the garden? I don't think so."
1270,499,4,"Similar to theWeber 6453 Style Rib Rack, this kabob set is something you'd really only get as a gift for someone, or if you happen to be a fan of the Weber brand and Style series.You're paying a relatively big premium over theWeber 6405 All-Purpose Kabob Set, and losing a kabob slot. But, you also receive one of the nicest looking kabob sets around, and it comes in a very nice full color box that looks nice as a gift and would be easy to wrap.The two-prong design on the skewers is really very good. They do a better than average job of keeping your food from spinning around randomly, when you're turning them. The Weber logo on each skewer is a nice touch, but they'll most likely turn brown by the time your kabobs are ready, and they're kind of a pain to keep clean.The wide handles on either side of the rack make it very easy to take your kabobs from the grill to your table, but like the rib rack, it will be extremely hot (especially if you're cooking with direct heat). You have to be very careful about where you put the rack, because it retains heat quite well.You may notice in one of the pictures, the person holding the rack has twoWeber Barbecue Mitts. Take it from someone who learned the hard way: you should have two of them, too. Depending on your tolerance for heat, you've got about 20 - 30 seconds to get from the grill to your destination with those mitts, before things start getting painful. Don't even try it with regular oven mitts, unless your table is directly next to your grill.Personally, I don't mind paying a little more for the double skewer design and the look of the Style series. The only drawback is that Weber doesn't offer additional skewers in a retail pack. I'd love to have about 10 more, so I could really keep a cookout with kabobs going. More likely than not, I'll give them a call and see if I can buy them from their parts department, and update this if they're willing to sell the skewers separately."
696,457,4,"We hang these in the tack room, laundry closet, vestibule, and rooms infrequently used.You should not hang these in rooms occupied more than 4 hours a day. So they have limited use around the house. When you do use them, they do work though!"
1317,752,5,"Have had this for the season now and it's hands down one of the most popular feeders in the yard.  The squirrels have attacked it a few times - even knocked it down once - but haven't been back since they can't get at the peanuts.This attracts all sorts of birds - Blue Jays, chickadees, nuthatches, woodpeckers - that don't normally show up at the other feeders.  Would highly recommend."
1344,276,5,"This feeder is heavy and made very well.  The top latches clip snugly to hold the lid and mesh is heavy duty.  The bronze color is nice as well.My only complaint is the weight.  We don't have any mature trees so I had to devise a way of hanging it.  Can't really call it a complaint, but if you have small trees don't expect to hang it in them."
242,883,5,"I don't really go through a lot of nozzles, but I have grown tired of the lower quality ones that I get at the hardware stores.  After taking a step backwards while washing the car and snapping the handle off of one that I liked (probably cost ~$15) because it was just plastic, I started looking around and found these.They sure look sturdy in the pictures, but my concern was functionality.  I'm used to the nozzles that swivel and let you choose between various types of sprays (full, shower, jet, and so forth).  Plus, I'm used to nozzles with pull handles.  So, I was nervous that I wouldn't like them, but I took a gamble - and won!  I'm writing this review to say that the various types of sprays available are pretty decent just from a rotating nozzle.  You can do a pretty gentle wide spray, to a more powerful wide spray, to an ever increasingly concentrated jet.  The outer cylinder turns so easily and quickly that you really don't have to worry too much about spraying everything down as you turn it closed and pass through the wide spray setting.  Plus, the water pressure is outstanding.  Granted, that depends on your supply, but it sure seems like these nozzles flow a lot more water than my other nozzles did.I put one of these on both of the hoses (front and back yards), and I find that I go out to water just to use them.  True, the plants do need the water :D, but I just like using them.  They have such a great feel to them.Quality-wise, they're very good.  One of them had some surface marks on the outside cylinder, but seeing as how my yards are mostly rock, I knew they'd get scratched up pretty quick anyway.  The extra washers are a nice touch, but those are pretty inexpensive at the hardware store - I wish that they would have put in some spare o-rings instead.  Not a gripe, mind you, as I think it was pretty cool that they put in spares of anything.So, while pretty darn expensive (they were over $44/pair when I ordered), I'm really happy with them - highly recommended."
1243,157,5,I picked these because when I'm smoking meat I want to grab the meat instead of sticking it with a pitch fork or something. Half the time it's too tender anyways and it wants to fall apart. These gloves make it easy to transport the meat from the grill to the pan.
121,809,4,"We've had occasional issues with gophers in the past, and use castor-based repellents annually as a result. Since we started doing so, we haven't had any gophers burrowing in our yard, though they're still in the area, as witnessed by the mounds in the yards of some of our neighbors. While getting them out of the yard in the first place takes a bit more work, castor-based products has proven effective in our experience when it comes to preventing repeat invasions.This particular repellent is similar to others on the market, but seems to be a finer grain and, as a result, dissolves more easily in water than others I've used. Thus, less water is necessary in its application."
368,761,5,"A mole was digging tunnels everywhere on the lawn.  The trap was placed in an active tunnel chosen because it was fairly recent.  It killed the mole in less than three hours.It appeared to have killed the mole quickly though it was certainly a gruesome sight to behold.  It seems the other moles can smell death on the trap because they have avoided it even after thorough washing.I do wish there were a way to get rid of the moles without killing them.  I also think a mole's life is worth more than grass and that killing them just for a pretty lawn is morally wrong.  They are just doing what they are supposed to do and they have their place in the universe and that should be respected.If you do want to kill moles, though, this is certainly an efficient trap."
892,653,5,"Great hummingbird feeder.  Durable, strong, easy to clean, fade/chip/scratch resistant polycarbonate construction; hummingbirds love it; attractive; made in USA.Exceptionally easy to clean and fill and comes with an effective built in ant guard.The perch sits up high, so when the little one are feeding, you have an excellent view of them."
1525,804,4,"Having previously had a pressure washer I was not fond of, I was excited to get this one.  However on arrival, while putting it together I noticed the engine was flopping around a lot.  On closer look, 3 out of the 4 rubber motor mounts were ripped through and detached.  Called customer service, and after a relatively short wait, and some confusing manual differences (mine had different pages and part layouts..but same part numbers), a friendly CS rep got me my parts in the mail.Fast forward a week and I got the parts put on (they also offered to have me take it in to have it done, and I think maybe even a tech come out if needed).  On putting on the parts I noticed that the stamped sheet metal piece the engine sits on had also been bent.  Really not a big deal, and doesn't look like it will bend any further.  It may affect the wheel kit (ie it pulls a bit hard), but this doesn't need to be that portable for me anyways.  Normal assembly includes putting the wheel kit on, handles, holders for the hose/extension/wand and hooking up the battery, quite minimal -- Don't forget to fill it with oil, it comes empty, and package does not include oil either, 10W-30 is recommended, about .6 quarts.First start went badly, not wanting to start at all using the electric start (which is a great addition),  What also worried me is that there was no water coming through with it off, still not sure why.  After tipping it back (also remember to open the fuel petcock), it decided to roar to life.  Slightly louder than some of the smaller honda engines I've had, but overall not too bad.  Pressure seemed very nice.  Different nozzles are a bit hard to get out of their holder, and it's annoying to disassemble the wand each time to store it, but that's what happens with most of these.Fuel tank is huge (and includes a gauge that actually seems to work!), sizing in at near 4 gallons, and if you are going to be putting the pressure washer down often to do other things you can enable the trigger shutoff, basically 10-15 seconds after you stop spraying it shuts off the engine.  Press on the trigger again, and 4-5 seconds later the engine roars to life.  It's a bit annoying if you accidentally trigger it, but in cases where you want to soap up the car, or move something, it's great to safe fuel, have less noise, and not have to manually start/stop the engine.The engine on this is considered a 'Chonda' engine I believe, a Chinese clone of the Honda engine, and with the right oil/maintenance it can have a good life, just be aware it is probably built to lesser standards and with lesser materials.  The pressure washer itself looks like a generator, and I believe uses the same frame, same engine, fuel tank, and just swaps out the pump for a generator, and the water panel for an electric one.  The benefit is that it stores easily (under a shelf for me), and holds a lot of fuel, plus offers storage.Overall it's a good little pressure washer, offering a great pump (comes with manual for just the pump, and replacement parts), high pressure, great fuel storage.  Hopefully yours comes packed better than mine, but even if it doesn't, they''ll take care of you."
688,276,4,I did not read the fine print and from the photo I thought this feeder was more red but it's more brownish bronze colored. It looks nice and it's easy to fill. You do not need to fill it with 5 lbs of seed. You can partial fill and it still works fine.It seems to get as much action as the rest of our feeders. The birds seem happy with it.
1536,777,3,"One the one hand, this feeder holds a ton of seed, and the two chambers allow you to put two different kinds out if you'd like.  On the other hand, this thing is giant and when full it's very heavy.  I know if it ever gets knocked off the hook by acrobatic squirrels, the weight will cause the plastic to shatter when it hits the ground.The small troughs the seed collects in at the bottoms of the sections have a lip that seems like a good height, the birds haven't made as much of a mess with this feeder compared to other models I've had."
932,33,5,"I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums, which I am not trying to reduce."
917,198,5,"The wide 24-inch rake head is beneficial for large or small jobs.  With the wind blowing in our area the majority of the time, it is not just leaves we have to rake up.

6,647,5,"hello,we have owned so many hoses that we lost count.  rubber, plastic, curly, non kink, lifetime warranty, etc.  they all did their respective jobs, but eventually wore out or were not repairable.  this hose is very lightweight for a 50 foot hose.  the kinks just pop straight when stretched.  be warned... when you first hook up the hose and put on a sprayer head, the hose will kink to no end.  just pull out the kinks by twisting to make a long smooth hose.  when you turn off the water, the hose should curl easily into near perfect circles to store the hose away. the water flow is so much better than other hoses we have owned.  after fighting to uncurl those lightweight curly hoses, this hose is so much better for every day use.  those curly hoses are plastic and can easily break or split.  owner repairable, but not worth the effort.the hose is lightweight and the color is 80's fluorescent, but looks very cool in the green garden. the gardeners with their nasty weed whackers will not mistake this color for grass or weeds.  we will see how long this hose will last with the usual amount of use in the garden.  great product and fast delivery..."
613,798,3,"WeI like our hummingbirds. We plant flowers and trees to attract them. We strategically position feeders in the shade and all over the yard to encourage them to sit and sip for awhile.  Color matters nothing except to me; never the birds. The soft green of the glass bottle is pleasant.Holding 3 cups of sugar water, this is the ""Big Gulp"" of feeders. It took our Annas 3 days to find our new ""Green Antique Bottle"" Hummingbird feeder.  It is not as pretty as our favorite French glass/redwood feeders but it holds twice as much, costs a lot less and is attractive. The base is plastic and screws on to the bottle. We will see how plastic holds up to our brutal sun. I will have to be extra careful about keeping it hanging under the shade of awnings to make it last.  At least I can oil the wooden ones which serve year after year.The metal across the top of the bottle means a couple of things.1.  It is attractive. The top notch fits our medium sized ""S"" rings perfectly- easy on, easy off. And it is easier on because you have a larger area to ""hook it"".2.  If the bottle breaks there is no way to replace it because the metal ring fits around the base of a particularly made bottle.3. Metal along the top is likely to heat the bottle and liquid in our 100+ degree constant summer sun. I'll need to be more careful about bacteria growth that may defeat the advantage of having a large capacity feeder container that you need to fill less often. OurHummingbird Feeder Brushwill have a much more difficult time cleaning the bottle where the neck flares out into the body of the bottle.But very important for us is...Yes, the hummingbirds are able to sit and sip. I was concerned that the larger flowers around the sip holes and angle to the feeder base would make it more difficult for the juveniles than the bases of our older feeders but they haven't noticed a problem and I won't either.The Perky-Pet Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feeder does what it's intended and a competitive price. I recommend it with reservations noted.Addendum June 27, 2013My wife went to clean and refill our feeders. When she unscrewed this one the base had a deep stress crack from the dispensing hole to the top of the plastic screw cap. It broke in less than a month. The feeder was placed in our prime spot under the awning of our kitchen window. The plastic screw base was not overtightened. The stress fracture appears to be the result of expansion and contraction during our hot sun and cooler nights.  Tomorrow we are expecting 114 degrees.Remorsefully she called customer service. She says it was difficult finding the website for Perky-Pets. The gentelman she spoke with was polite, listened with interest and was respectful. No they do not have replacement parts. He was kind to recommend a different model with a metal base. How nice to see a company interested in its customer experience and willing to make things right. Once we receive the new hummingbird feeder I will post it here for your consideration.Addendum August 1, 2013Perky-Pet Mason Jar Hummingbird Feeder is the recommended replacement feeder. I cannot link to it right now because they are out of stock. It is an all metal base with Glass Jar container. No plastic to stress. Attractive. Hummingbirds will sit occasionally on the metal perch but it's not their favorite even though I moved it to their favorite prime location. I will review this item."

1058,694,3,".As others have noted, these discs are made of a material that is much akin to that in a re-usable furnace filter or a floor sanding disc. While at this writing I haven't used my Vine sample for a full summer growing season, I can offer a couple of cogent observations to potential buyers:1. The material stands up well to a compression test and due to the material with which it is constructed, I can't see that the ""compressibility"" would change any when it is wet or damp. [I tested it by simply pinching it together to see how much ""give"" it has...]2. Using a stack of these in a pot would be prohibitively expensive.CONCLUSION: For me, while I can see where these may be useful in very specific and limited applications, I will not be using them on a regular basis due to the cost vs. the cost of the copious amount of clay pot shards that I, and I suppose most experienced gardeners, have on hand for free.

446,10,3,"July 18th, Just received the first bug zapper. Currently giving it one star rating r/t it being DOA. As always, Amazon stands by its products and has excellent customer service. I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48"" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement! The zapping grid is still a bit bent out of shape, but its obviously working, so no complaints!One note: In the directions it states, ""The (product number)15 and (product number)80 are designed with a three pronged (grounded) plug). The (product name)40 is made with a two pronged plug and should be installed with the appropriate plug recepticle. ... NOBODY sells 2-prong extension cords anymore!

1448,592,3,"I live in a very humid area of the country, so I figured I'd give this product a tough trial.  I was especially pleased to be able to try it before 'ant season' was in full swing.  Accordingly I read the directions, sprinkled the stuff all around the house perimeter, as directed, and hoped for a miracle.Though this did not eliminate ants completely, it did indeed cut way back on the evidence of ants.  And (YAY!) I haven't seen a slug yet.  This stuff purports to fend off slugs (a big problem for me in my house).  So, 5 stars for anti-slug efficacy; 3 stars for ant repelling powers.  Technically that should mean a 4-star rating. It's still better than anything else I have tried to date. But it does not eliminate ants, unfortunately."
338,938,3,"We've been looking for a humming bird feeder that is mostly made of metal and glass... AND is easy to fill.  This feeder is not easy to fill -- you have flip it upside down and in doing so, liquid often comes out of the flower holes.  And if you don't super tighten the glass cylinder to the base, it leaked.  We had to tighten it so much that we began to worry about the glass breaking.  I'll add that the sugary liquid is sticky and frustrating to clean up as I'm sure most people know.  So Perky Pet, please go back to the drawing board and figure out an easier was to fill this while keeping the metal and glass.  Thanks!"
469,713,2,"The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison.  However, the poison is Bromethalin.  One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.  The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die, which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this, and it is deadly to dogs (and even more so to cats, but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic, at least from what I have observed!).  There is no antidote, so if you have a rambunctious dog, you might want to consider a snap trap (annoying to a dog, but not lethal).Now, does it work?  In my experience, nope.  I placed these traps along with an electronic trap, and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run (we catch about a half dozen a week).  After 10 days I pried the station open (which is not recommended) to be sure the bait had been gnawed.  It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps (at least I know where the dead mice are) or my new fangled electrocution chamber (which also kills instantly).I did put it outside now (where if the mice die someplace else I do not have to smell them), and if I see that the bait is taken I will report back.  As a note, the Tier 3 (which is less resistant to pets, did show signs of mouse activity)"
115,78,1,"I added teflon to the water connections,  and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on.  Dry test worked fine i would hear the click.  But once I added the water and did nothing.  My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible.  I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions."
384,899,4,"This is a wonderful multiuse tool that both sucks and blows! Yep, it will suck up your leaves and carefully place them into a bag that you can empty into your mulch box (You do have one don't you?). Of course, you may be one of those who simply mow your leaves back into your lawn. It will also blow those grass clippings off of your driveway back into the lawn.Do I sound like one of those ""green"" people? Actually, our community has an ordinance prohibiting green waste from going into our landfill, so this was a lifesaver for me.The best parts:It is battery operated. I do NOT do gas powered items - sorry, they intimidate me. And, while I don't mind cords, my husband hates them, so the only way for both of us to enjoy this is the mere fact that it IS battery operated.It is ""relatively"" light. It weighs in at about 6 pounds. While I would prefer to have it lighter (I would prefer to have EVERYTHING lighter) WORX runs over 8 pounds, and Toro is 10 pounds for their blower/vacs.It is GreenWorks. I have been using other garden products of theirs for some time and have grown to appreciate the way that they have lasted for me.It is easy to use.The things that are concerns:This comes with a single battery. Replacement batteries run more than $100. Hopefully the battery lasts a long time, but if you need to use this on high for a period of time OR you have a large yard, this may not be the right one for you. On lower settings, I can use this for about an hour.This is my first blower OR vac, so I have little to compare it to, but I really do appreciate it in our 1/3 of an acre yard with 4 large trees and one small fruit tree."
512,874,4,What a fun little kit to get you into everything you need to start gardening. With prices going up and pay going down it's time to find ways to save yourself some $. This i a fool proof way to start you off in gardening very easy to use starter pods will have you reaping some useful product.Very happy with the end results and look forward to planting the rest of them when the season starts next year.
1496,729,2,"What a let down.  We recently bought a house that's vinyl siding had not been cleaned in ages.  I was excited to try this product, but after carefully following the directions, I could see no difference between using it or powerwashing with plain water.  Save your money.  The only plus was that it is supposedly safe for plants, but what does that matter if it doesn't clean well?"
730,7,5,"At the risk of sounding like an idiot...I am 45-years-old. I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years. And I have NEVER had a power edger. I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned, manual edger. Finally, after too many blisters, a sore back, and just plain old laziness, I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog. And boy...Am I glad I did! Right out of the box, I could tell this was a quality product. Assembly couldn't have been any easier. Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle. No tools required! And everything else is pre-assembled. I had used a power edger in the past. Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something. But for all practical purposes, this was my first time. And it was easy as pie. I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog. The edging was done fast and easy. What a difference, too! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger. Instead I now get a nice clean ""professional"" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers. I had a $25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member. So for about $65.00 total, I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!"
158,85,5,"I bought this tool because of the reviews. The reviews were so correct. This tool is a great investment. You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc. on your property. If the branch fits into the opening, you can get a good clean cut. You have to get used to the cutting angle, but after a short time, you become a pro. Great tool!"
1081,237,1,"I have alot, alot, alot of moles in my yard.  Or are they voles?  I'm not sure.  I find little holes everywhere, and I find big mounds everywhere.  Maybe mine are hybrid mole-voles.  Whatever they are, they do not like Tomcat worms.  Never even touched them."

663,729,4,"Yes I have used this product for over 10 years.  Yes it takes the &#34;krud&#34; off of the outside walls, window sills, eaves etc of your house. But the ingredient Sporex(R), which they claim is a unique additive which removes the toughest stains from mold, mildew, algae, dirt, grease, oil, sap, oxidation and more, may help remove the &#34;stain&#34; but not the mold, mildew and algae.  You still need to use bleach.  In fact I use the bleach first to kill the mold, mildew and algae in my ACE plastic sprayer which is designed for bleach mix.  After you let that sit for 15 minutes or so you get your pressure washer powered up with Krud Kutter siphoned into the pressure washer stream.  You begin by a low pressure settling to apply the Krud Kutter and let it sit for again about 15 minutes.  Then you go crazy with higher pressure settings (absent the siphon of Krud Kutter).  Doing this method you will have a very clean exterior surface."
427,205,5,This is a great buy and solid quality. I would strongly recommend it. I have one hanging at both my houses.
1415,934,2,"This is OK soil for a garden but it is full of branch pieces, sticks, and even a few stones.  If I am buying soil, I don't want to pay for stones and such.  I understand  that it is not potting soil and could overlook a stick or two.  This was just too much"
66,838,2,"Unfortunately, the hose did not work as expected.There is a plus, the hose is lightweight, so if that's what you're going for, then it may work for you, but be cautioned about the following.1. The hose didn't expand much at allIt seemed like the hose should expand, but it really didn't. It seemed to expand a little bit, but not like we thought it would.2. Reduced Water FlowEven with the hose facet turned open to full, the flow rate through the hose is abysmal (way less than half the flow). I suppose pressure is lost in helping the hose to expand, but we didn't see it expand much in the first place.3. Cheap connectorsThe connectors at both ends of the hose feel cheap, and seem like they could break easily.4. Strong chemical/manufacturing smell.When we opened the hose, it smelled terrible. It reeked of synthetic material. Letting a few weeks go by, the smell has become less, but it's still there. Perhaps they should have let it air out at the factory before packaging it in it's plastic bag.If you're going for a light weight hose and don't need a lot of water pressure, and it doesn't matter to you if the hose expands much, then this hose will work for you. But if you care about what it's actually supposed to do, then get another hose."
1166,795,5,"A few short minutes after filling this little feeder and hanging it outside, the hummingbirds moved in for their first feast.  In the days since then, it has been a constant draw for the hummingbirds, as well as the occasional red headed woodpecker (its rather amusing to watch them acrobatically approach the thing!)  This feeder is brightly colored and sturdily built.  If you love hummingbirds, the Perky-Pet feeder will draw them in!  Great product."
469,745,5,"The first thing I did when I received this product was to label all the cords with id that they belong to this kit.  The USB cord looks like every other one you own, but is for charging the battery pack and I did not want to confuse it with my zillion other cords.  There is a nice zippered pouch for storing all these bits and pieces.I could not find any way to remove the ""protective film"", I believe that these panels did not actually have any film on them.  If they do, then they are working fine with the film on them.We live in New Mexico at 7300 feet altitude, and that that altitude we get some serious solar energy.  In fact the GoalZero Guide 10 Plus adventure kit was able to charge 4 Eneloop 1900mAh AA batteries from drained to full in 1.75 hours.  The slow green light (50 -80% was actually lit after 50 minutes)  It charged 900mAh batteries AAA from drained to full in about 45 minutes at midday, when laid flat on a cloudless day.Some devices will complain if they sense the charge is too low (notably Apple products), in that case you run the charge through the battery pack (while still being able to charge the batteries).We were able to charge (without sending the power through the battery pack) the following items on a sunny day in New Mexico.Kindle Keyboard2 kinds of Samsung phonesSansa clipBattery pack for a TI InspireCreative Zen mp3 playerTom Tom GPSUsing the battery pack we were able to charge an Ipod 4G.  I tried charging my ASUS laptop (one can dream, right?) by using the cigarette adapter and a plug I have for the car.  That was not successful.I also accidentally left the solar charging panels out in a rainstorm, and they still worked fine after drying out.  (I had the panels outside the patio door with the Kindle inside the house).  You do need to think about this, your device you are charging may not stand up to the rain as well.  The battery pack instructions state that you should ""shield it from direct sunlight"" and that ""unexpected rain storms probably won't harm it"".  I do wish the charging cable were a little longer so that shielding it would be easier.Overall, I love this product.  I love knowing  I will be able to charge my cell phone, the batteries for my nieces insulin pump and necessary items (like my Kindle!) even if the power is out for an extended amount of time.I am going to type up some info from the instructions, that might be useful in making a purchase decision and is not listed above in the Amazon page.  Everything below this is from the manuals.Nomad 7 (the solar panels)USB output port: Accepts any standard USB cable for charging USB devices.Solar Output Port: Charges Guide 10 battery pack faster than USB.Car adapter and 12V output port: Connect the car adapter (included) to charge small 12 V devices.*FAQ  from Nomad 7 (solar panel)What will my NOMAD 7 charge?The NOMAD 7 will directly charge most USB and 12 V devices (not tablets).Can I use the USB and 12V ports to charge devices simultaneously?Yes.  The Nomad 7 will split the incoming solar power between the two ports to charge devices simultaneously.  Some devices may not be compatible.Why am I having trouble charging my smart phone?Smart phones require very specific, consistent input.  If your NOMAD 7 is angle perfectly, there should'nt be an issue.  However, most charging issues with a smart phone are made simpler by incorporating a Goal Zero power pack as an intermediary (such as Guide 10 Plus) (*note, this is the battery pack).Is the Nomad 7 waterproof?The nomad 7 is weather resistant and will not be harmed if exposed to rain or snow.What kind of solar cells do you use in the Nomad 7?We use state of the art monocrystalline technology in the Nomad 7 because it delivers more power per square inch than any other solar technology on the market.Can the Nomad 7 be chained with other devices?No.*FROM THE FAQ for the Guide 10 plus (the battery pack)What batteries can be used?Any AA or AAA NiMH can be sued and recharged, we do not recommend other types of batteries.  4 same sized batteries MUST be charged at once, but not all batteries need to be empty.How do I charge?From solar: use GOAL ZERO Nomad 3.5 or Nomad 7 with solar charge cable for fast charging.From USB: Use any USB power source, such as computer or and GOAL ZERO power pack.Is it waterproof?No, but it is weather resistant.  Care should be taken to shield it from direct sunlight and the elements.  Unexpected rain storms probably won't harm it.How is it protected? Usage is plug and play.  The built in battery management system prevents overcharge and over discharging of batteries.  The USB output will only supply the amount of power needed."
452,723,5,My cucumbers were under attack of aphids. I ordered these and they arrived dead thanks to my mailman and wife leaving them in the mailbox. I contacted the seller and they happily replaced my order. I spread these girls out around dusk and misted the garden to give the bugs some hydration. Its been about a week now an there all over the garden still. Make sure you have plenty of plants for them to hang out on. A raised bed with a few small baby plants wont give them much of a habitat. I have a 30x30 garden with over 20 types of fruits and vegetables and these bugs are loving it.
835,246,5,"Solid and strong, this 2-way connector does the job.  It's a little hard to turn the small knobs that open/close each hose connector, but other than that I have absolutely no complaints.  I use this connector in conjunction with a timer to water my garden.  Using 2 hoses at the same time adequately covers it."
1685,167,4,I got this repellent primarily to keep squirrels away from around our bird feeder. I paid close attention to see if the product was actually working and I did see a s difference. Squirrels were still around but they would not come close to the area I treated with the repellent. The effect lasted for a few days (which is expected) so I am pleased with this repellent.The battery powered sprayer works well and it makes it a lot easier to spray. I do recommend this product.
439,633,5,"I have a small yard and love to garden, so I use pots for my flowers and veggies.  Pots are way more convenient than a regular garden.  You can move your pot to better place if not doing well where you put them.  Weeding is much easier too.  Usually I plant in 10"" black nursery pots and put them into more decorative foam pots.  I needed some 8"" pots and found these.  They are very nice looking and about the right size so I ordered a bunch.  They look just as good as the picture, hard to tell they are plastic.  The bonus is you can make them a self watering pot.  Each one has an insert in the bottom which allows for a water reservoir.  If you're putting outside in the open I recommend drilling a small hole in the side just about level with the top of the insert to allow water to drain.  I've done this with similar pots and it works really well.  This way you don't have to water as often.  If you want there is a ""punch out"" in the bottom marked with a cross which allows drainage at the bottom.  Considering the looks and the drainage options these are excellent for the money."
735,167,5,"I had to wait quite awhile after receiving this product, because it wouldn't stop raining here. But we did finally get a couple of dry days, and we got to try the product. I was actually quite happy with it!The electric pump system works great. It primed quickly, and has a very nice, even spray pattern that makes it easy to get full, even coverage on the plants. It's easy to use and lightweight to carry around. The holster, while not perfect, keeps the spray head corralled when the product is on the shelf or when you're carrying it, rather than having it dangling down in the way.The spray itself is not as rank smelling as Deer Skid or other rotten egg preparations, even though the label says it has more of the active ingredients than other sprays. Because it started raining again three days after spraying, I can't attest to how long an application lasts or how effective it is, although I can say that there was no new deer chomping on my plants during that three day window.The good points: The premix formula is great for small applications. It's there, ready, when you need it and it doesn't go bad sitting on the shelf, so you don't have to use it all up in one application. The sprayer means that people with limited physical ability can use it easily, rather than having to pump up a tank sprayer or kill their hands squeezing a small sprayer a million times. It think it'll be especially nice for when a person puts a new plant into the garden and it needs a quick spray to protect it.The bad? Cost. Premix solutions are always a more expensive option than concentrates- you're paying for water. But the jug is easily refillable with Deer Off made from concentrate, and I suspect the spray head will last through a good many applications. I think this is a good new tool for gardening."
191,433,4,"This bird feeder/waterer is very pretty and with the lovely hanger, it's as unique as it is functional.The feeder is made of plastic, although the top and bottom of each ""silo"" are covered in an antique copper colored metallic paint. The hanger is a copper colored metal. Because of this, it is very lightweight. That might be a plus for someone who could not easily refill a heavier feeder.You replenish each silo by removing it from the hanger, unscrewing the silo from the base, refilling with seed or water, and then screwing the base back on and rehanging. They don't hold a lot of seed or water so I think I will have to refill them frequently. I hung it in a spot where I had a different feeder and within minutes, there were birds at the feeder and the waterer.I was pleased to see that there are drainage holes on the base of the seed silo so that in the event of rain, the seed will not get soggy/wet/moldy.My concern is that the plastic will become brittle and break quickly in the brutal Texas sun, but I hope I am wrong. It is certainly a lovely addition to my yard."
120,936,5,I used this to seed start a whole lot of morning glories and coleus plants this year. The seeds did very well. Thanks.
593,288,5,My rating is based on the opinions of assorted birds.  They never leave a crumb of this stuff in the suet holder on the bird feeder.  Must be good !!
693,229,3,"We have a variety of animals in our neighborhood including deer, squirrels, rabbits, birds, etc.  And, that doesn't count the pet varieties.  We wanted a way to keep the animals, especially the deer, away from our plants.  They come off a park behind the houses across the street from us, go through our yard, and then scatter through the neighborhood.  This product did okay, but it washes away with the rain (which occurs quite a bit) and it needs to be reapplied."
335,840,5,"This lounge is perfect for naps. The cushion is deep and soft. The frame is solid and sturdy. I don't know what weight it's rated to hold but we put over 400lbs of pressure on it just to see if if would give anywhere and it showed absolutely no signs of stress.I'm 6' tall and had no problem sitting comfortably on it while it was in a reclining position. When I lay down completely it's a little short. My wife is a little shorter at 5'8"" and it fit her perfectly.We received the package via a local delivery agency and had absolutely no problems. The chair came in mint condition right out of the box.The lounge has a nice look to it. It's elegant, sturdy, and weather resistant. It's a great look for anyone who wants to create an extra ""room"" out on the patio or deck."
278,931,5,"I have been using an earlier version of this particular Scott&#8217;s Miracle Gro for my cactus and succulents for sometime now.  I have also been using Miracle Grow products for years and years and have been extremely satisfied with all.  I particularly like this 8 quart size as I use this stuff on small pots and hate storing large bags that somehow seem to gather in groups in my barn; temporarily forgotten until I buy a new bag and then I am stuck with yet another half filled bag &#8211; good place for the spiders to live though so I suppose it is doing some good.Anyway, I do mix this potting soil with various other organic material, depending upon what it is I am attempting to grow.  For some plants I add a bit of sand or for others a bit of compost from my compost pit and of course I have an ever present supply of perlite.Now this particular stuff does have nutrients in it which according to the bag instructions are good for six months.  I do not use a lot of fertilizer at first because the two leading causes of house plant deaths are over fertilizing and over watering.  You sort of have to get to know your plants as to what mix you use and how often you fertilize.The price here is about what I pay at the local garden shop; depending of course on sales events.Over all this has been a very good product and far superior to other mixes I have used in the past.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
552,167,3,"My house is on a golf course in a rural area of the Pacific Northwest.  Since my yard borders the fairway, I have no way to fence out either the marauding deer nor the equally obnoxious golfers.  This year I'm using Deer Off in hopes of warding off at least one of my problem pests.  The deer seem especially fond of Crocosmia.  They always wait until the night before the flowers are going to bloom, and then strip off the top 25% of each and every plant. I have yet to see a flower on these plants, so I gave the whole area a liberal treatment. I appreciate the built in, battery operated sprayer (batteries included, even!)since a pump spray can give you hand cramps in no time.The smell was strong while I was applying it but seemed to go away once it settled and dried on the leaves.  The product description says it is rain resistant but the label says that rain, mist, fog, damp, or cold conditions during or right after spraying can reduce product effectiveness.  Those things are ""par for the course"" around here so it is a challenge to find just the right window of opportunity to apply.It is early spring here so neither the deer nor the tender new leaves are out in force yet so I can't say with certainty how effective it will b., So far, at least they seem to be choosing less stinky yards to ravage.  The product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee there's nothing to lose, right?Having read the other reviews, I will be tempted to refill this container with homemade solution when its empty and compare the two..."
435,874,5,These plants are perfect for someone like me who does not have anything remotely resembling a green thumb.  For me the simpler the better when it comes to growing things.The good thing about something like this is it minimizes mistake. The seeds are planted at the correct level in the pods so all I had to do was insert the pods in the soil and not over water them.I planted these a little late in the season but the weather is still warm and I have already seen all of the herbs and vegetables growing well. Hopefully I can soon harvest some home grown herbs and vegetables.As the product mentions these come with only 18 pods. If these survive my care I will get more next year and actually have a real garden.
1631,790,5,We have this hanging on an iron stand with a baffle.  The feeder is easy to fill and holds more seed (2 lbs maybe?) than many feeders.  We get a good variety of birds and are overall satisfied with the purchase.
450,951,5,I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review.  This product is great and works well for all of your food on the grill.  It is very sturdy and seems like it will last a long time for me.  I was impressed how easy this product is to use and it does not break up your food which other grill tongs have done in the past for me.  I hope that you will consider this product because it is wonderful!
652,946,5,"I have been using Black & Decker 18volt tools for years, but I decided it was time to start upgrading my tools and I started with this 20volt Weed Trimmer. And I have to say everything about this trimmer is an improvement.The 20v battery is stronger but half the size and weight of the 18v battery. It charges faster and holds its charge longer between use. And it comes with two batteries! One to use and one to charge.  All rechargeable tools should come with two batteries!It also has a power slide that allows you to control how much power it is using. If you are just trimming grass, set it at 1 and the charge will last much longer. But if you have some big weeds, slide it up to 6 for more power.The trimmer line is automatic feed and you can buy replacement spools that just click on if you don't like winding your line.And I will admit the wheel on the front of the head does look silly, but it works. After you swivel the head around, you roll the wheel down the edge of your sidewalk and it becomes a very good edger, the wheel keeps it at a consistent depth.Overall a definite improvement over the old trimmer and I can't wait to get more of these 20v tools."
1270,492,5,"I received this as a gift after I got myWeber Genesis S-320, and couldn't be happier with a brush.This thing is solid, heavy, and has an excellent ergonomic design. Cleaning up the back of your grill while it's still burning is no problem. It's long enough to get there easily, and the curved handle keeps your hand far enough away from the flames to keep your hair from burning off.I've been especially happy with the bristles. Most of the brushes I've owned will start to bend out or flatten after just a few uses, but these bristles mostly stay put. The double-sided scraper blade fits Weber's stainless steel grates like a glove, too.Overkill? Sure. But when you add up the number of cheap-o no-name brushes you'll go through, this is actually reasonably priced (and much nicer)."
30,921,5,"This an interesting idea especially if you have an outbuilding that has no electricity.  I decided on the shed I have down the garden, I was using an hanging lantern but not really that efficient or enough light.  Anyway easy to set this up, you basically put the solar panel where there is a lot of sun (in my case on the roof of the shed) then run the cord down and plug it into the control unit (the single socket on one side) and then plug in the 2 fixed lamps into any of the 4 sockets and wait for the sun to do it's work.This is where I have the problem, I am in WA so sun is not readily available this time of year but surprisingly after about a day I managed to get both lamps running and for the time I needed.  There is also a lantern included which you can also charge with the control unit.  The lantern is portable so great for walking back and forth when it is getting dark.I now pop in the shed whenever I want and I have all the light I need.  The 2 fixed lamps have switches so can be turned off and on and the lantern is the same.  One night I left everything on to see how good this was and next day the lights were still working.  You can also buy 2 extra fixed lamps because this has 4 sockets.  Also with this kit you don't necessarily need sun, you can just charge the control unit by putting a 12v 0.5A power adapter into the solar panel socket.The control unit also has a USB so you could use this for charging other devices like cell phones etc.  This would work really well if you were camping, you set everything up, have plenty of light and you can charge your devices.Build quality is decent, the solar panel and control unit are excellent.  The fixed lamps and lantern are plastic but sturdy enough.I like the idea of this kit and a new one for me, I  have never done anything solar before so a great experiment and a successful one too.  Great for outbuildings but I can certainly see a lot of campers going for this too."
922,708,4,"This pot filler pillow is great for small and large pots, but isn't suitable for medium-sized pots.For the medium-sized pots, there is simply not enough room left over for soil.Furthermore, this pot filler would best be used on plants which are replanted every 6 months to a year. That way the plant is getting some additional nutrients every so often.The plant I put in to the pot with this pot filler had significant roots and would be squeezed too much if it was in a medium-sized pot. If you had a plant with little root system (aloe vera, violets, etc.) then you'd potentially be okay.The plant I planted using this pot filler is growing healthy and strong.in sum, if you are planning on buying a pot filler and planting a plant there and leaving it for several years, this product isn't fr you."
332,880,4,"For the amount this item costs, I would say its a good purchase. Comes in a nice bag, I would not say this would replace a standard good garden hose. However if you live in an apartment or such and want an easy way to have a hose and wash your car or such, I would say buy it."
349,493,4,This mousetrap is very easy and intuitive to use with barely a glance at the instructions.  Similarly it  easy to monitor whether  it is set or has been triggered with just a glance. Reasonably well made and easy to use in my continuing battle against mouse intruders. .
411,946,5,"Not as strong as my corded trimmer, but it certainly does the job well enough that I'm storing my corded trimmer in the attic as ""backup.""What I like:1.  TWO batteries!  Yay.  They're easy on / easy off, lightweight, and relatively quick to charge.2.  Convenient, easy-to-use adjustments. This unit is quite versatile.  With a quick squeeze, the base rotates 180 degrees and snaps into place, thus making edging a breeze.  Another quick squeeze at the base and it's back to being a 'regular' trimmer.  The height adjustment is also an excellent feature.  Lift a little lever and the unit easily adjusts for different lengths. This enables my 11-yr old daughter to adjust the unit shorter so she can get a decent angle for trimming.  She had a tough time getting a good angle using my taller corded trimmer.3.  Very lightweight overall, yet balanced and sturdy.4.  Trimmer wheel.  I've seen a few disparaging reviews about the wheel, but frankly, I think it makes trimming easier and more uniform, too. First, it's a godsend for helping my daughter make lawns look sharp in her new yard-care business (her previous work without such a guide was not pretty).  However, I love the wheel, too, as it makes edging a breeze.  I say if the wheel bothers you, be proactive and take it off!5.  I also like that the batteries work on other B & D products.  I have decided to get more B & D products that use these interchangable batteries, so there will be no more dealing with cords when I'm doing lawn care.  It will make things very convenient.What I don't like:As mentioned, it's not as powerful as my corded trimmer, but it still does the job and I'm quite happy with it.  So, if less power is my only complaint, I really have nothing to complain about.  :-)Five stars for sure.  I wish I'd bought one of these a long time ago."
392,870,5,"I've had my hot tub for years and getting the right chemical balance and clean, clear, nice-smelling water can often be a puzzle. The key is having the right combination of products and using them consistently. I think it's also important to change the water and filter regularly, and also to try to limit the amount of contamination the water gets from users who wear lotion, oils, perfumes, bug repellants or whatever into the spa -- along with a suit that may have been washed using soap.That said, I've found this liquid enzyme product to be very effective in controlling organic deposits and in making the water odor free and clear. I add about 15-20 mL (a little over half an ounce) of the liquid in my hot tub along with my brominating tablets andRenew 2.2 lb Leisure Time Spaeach week. I sometimes add a little extra of the spa enzymes after I've had a large party of guests. I maintain the water temperatre at around 100-104F as the product is designed to use in warmer water. I keep my spa open and use it all year long and it seems to make my other sanitizing agents work more efficiently to maintain a good chemical balance. I also like that you can use the spa immediately and that you don't have to circulate the water for long periods after adding in order for it to work. It does not cause skin irritation or dryness. I've noticed less scum along the walls of the tub as well! I'm all about less maintenance and am quite pleased to recommend this item."
498,78,4,"The second unit has worked very well. We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood. Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house, I guess as it strolled by. Well, this took care of it. After about 10 days, we shut it off and we're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device. Seems well made."
734,424,5,"Other products that say they can read the fill of a propane tank are wrong. This is the only fool proof way to know how much propane is left in your tank. I had read other reviews about the other products (magnetic strips or gauges) and they all have bad reviews. Such a simple invention that works, well done. Even if you have a propane tank that is installed inside a compartment in your BBQ, it takes 30 seconds to remove it and see what you have left, so no big deal. A lot better than not knowing what you have in your tank and running out mid BBQ only to have to put a new one in."

I keep my flowers and plants indoors to weather the elements or until they become strong enough to go out of the pot into my garden. I also use this on  a few pots I have in the house, The plus is that you do not have to water a lot, I like to be able to go and not have neighbors come water my flowers. This does well for keeping the plants or flowers Hydrated, but I think for the price there are better alternatives. Great product easy to use."

143,938,4,"My biggest issue with having a hummingbird feeder in Orlando has been the heat and the bugs.  Ants and wasps seem to love my feeders even more than the hummingbirds.  This feeder has some built in bee guards that protect from bees and a tiny ant guard which protects from wandering ants.  So far I have not been bothered by either when using this feeder.The feeder is an attractive copper with a glass bottle.  The bottle has a wide mouth for easy filling and the feeder comes with an initial supply of Perky Pet.  The bottom of my feeder is indeed removable and comes apart to clean the internals.  However, the bottom is plastic and does not stay connected unless I use the originally supplied twist ties to keep it affixed.  This also leads to some leakage over time.Overall &#8211; this is a very attractive feeder that is well-liked by the hummers.  My biggest issue is the design of the base and keeping the metal portion connected to the plastic bottom.  Other than that&#8230;this is a great upgrade for a traditional all-plastic feeder."
1391,884,5,"This is one solid marinate and seasoning injector I can definitely live with.  For one thing it's stainless steel, easy to clean, and won't absorb any odors or flavors of any previous ingredients used.  It's very well-designed and easy to handle with the 3-ring handle and, unlike its plastic counterparts, will last for a long time.  Once you are through using it, it will come apart totally for cleaning.  Simply unscrew the top beneath the two rings and then pull the plunger out.PROS:~  Easy clean~  Holds up to 2 ounces of marinate or seasoning~  There are markings on the flat side of the plunger you can use to gauge your liquid from 1/2 ounce to the full 2 ounces~  Stainless steel, a solid material that will hold up for years~  Designed to use high pressure to inject your meats~  The package includes two needles, one for liquid marinade, the other for chopped solids such as garlic and onionCON:~  It's so solid, it's a bit difficult to press down the plunger.  You'll need to use one hand to balance the body of the injector and the other to use the plunger.I do love this seasoning injector, partially because I love kitchen gadgets, but mostly because it's of very good quality like some of my old-time collectibles.  The body of the injector and needles are definitely stainless, but the top appears to be a composite.  No problem if after you wash it you let it dry thoroughly before reassembling so it won't start to flake off in the interior.  All in all, this is a great little seasoning injector that should last for years.  The feature I especially like is the fact that there is the second needle that will accommodate solids such as chopped garlic in olive oil, something that's especially nice when seasoning a pork roast.Sample provided for review."
1683,196,5,it fixed my squirrel problems real fast. i have a huge container garden that i use to grow some plants that i love to grow. the squirrels were attracted to my nursery pots and they did a lot of damage to my plants and tore up a lot of my plants and the soil. i used deer off repellent and they didn't enter my yard period after that. i sat there in my lawn chair and watched those squirrels outside of my property line and just stood there looking. i will have to routinely spray this product around the perimeter of my garden to keep the squirrels out.

All good things must come to an end and Mr. Sun finally reared his head and stirred up those wacky, zany ants. Let me tell you, the ants must have been hungry after such a long winter because the ants came marching two by two, hurrah, right into my kitchen. Alas, I had Safer Brand Ant Killer which I had been dying to use. I distributed it evenly around my window where the ants seem to have carte blanche into my house. I put it both inside my house around the window and outside where they were making their grand entrance. I kid you not...within 24 hours I did not have ONE ant in my house. I'm not sure where they went, but I am assuming they ate this powder and went off to die somewhere. I highly recommend this ant killer. I couldn't be happier."

278,777,5,"Over the years we have turned our yard which is located in the woods and has an orchard, into a mini bird sanctuary.  With the addition of the feeder being reviewed here we have somewhere around 18 different feeding stations for the birds...actually, many of these stations are no more that cafeterias for squirrels (we have on my last estimation about 35 of the bushy tailed little rodents we feed), raccoons, possums and ever present field mice.  About 1/4th of our feeders are home made...the others commercial.Anyway, this tube type feeder is a bit larger that most we use and so fare I have been quite happy with it.  It holds a lot of seed and the two levels work quite well.  Once you get the hang of it, it is easy to fill and easy to clean...the cleaning is quite important with this feeder as it is with all feeders.This feeder is stout and well made and by the looks of it and the material used in making it, it should last for quite some time.  Now as to being squirrel proof...well, no it is not...not by a long way.  Very few feeders unless you go with the high dollar ones which are build like Fort Knox are completely squirrel proof.  I will say that this feeder is squirrel ""resistant"" and so far we have had much less of a problem with it than we have with many of our other feeders.This feeder, due to its size, allows larger birds access to the food than do many of the smaller tube feeders.  I know that many do not like this...in particular when it comes to blackbirds and Jays, but in our case we figure that those guys need to be fed just as much as the ""cute little things,"" so we really do not care.Overall we have been quite satisfied with this feeder and if problems pop up in the future I will update this review and address those problems.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"

480,935,4,"Perlite is a naturally occurring substance that is commonly used with potted plants to prevent soil compaction. It can also be used improve drainage and promote strong root development. You can also use it to store bulbs and root crops by pouring it around them and not packing or watering.The amount you use should depend on the particular plant. With rarer plants, chances are that you can find a website that gives a soil recipe saying how much to use in proportion to anything else. The bag says that this 8 QT bag will fill two eight inch pots, so that should give an idea how much perlite you will get.Miracle-Gro's brand also contains their plant food. Previously it had total Nitrogen is 0.04%, Available phosphate is 0.01% and Soluble potash is 0.06%. The bag I just got lists 0.07% each for all three. Although I've had very good results with their plant food, I'm not sure if there's a big advantage to having it integrated since you could add it on your own and I would recommend having a supply on hand. Nevertheless, it probably couldn't hurt. I say ""probably"" because there are some rare tropical plants and probably others that survive on very little nutrients and can be damaged by additives. Nevertheless, I have used this (previous formula) with Nepenthes Ventrata without any problems, and that's a species that's more sensitive to soil balance and more likely to be harmed by the wrong additives than most common house plants.For more typical houseplants, there should be no worries. Miracle-Gro is a leader in plant food and their website has a lot of helpful information on how to use their various products. The instructions on the bag give steps for use with root cuttings and for storing bulbs and root crops. They don't go into specifics for general use and there are a lot of guidelines from horticulturalists but they tend to vary. But it boils down to taking some perlite and other potting soil and mixing it together.  In most cases, somewhere between 25% and 50% will be appropriate. There are even some who grow things in 100% perlite, but I have found that 20-25% works well for me with house plants and a higher ratio works well for vegetable plants.Previously, this came in a bag that was easy to reseal, with a ""Ziploc"" style closure. This new one comes in an easy open non-resealable bag. It's not much of a criticism, but that's a step down from what they had before."

952,63,5,We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal. The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor. The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it. It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it. Honestly it's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart.

1059,466,5,"7/12/12: OK, now I don't know how long this thing will hold up, but I can tell you that it's the best weed whacking head I've ever used, so far.  I can speak with some authority, here, as I'm a Certified Arborist who works around outdoor gizmos all day long, everyday. I used this unit for part of my home's grounds, though, as I don't get into lawn work in my day job.  I whacked about a half-acre using just the string that came with the head.  I never changed out the originals.  With every other head I've had it's been whack 3-5 minutes, change out the string.  This head kept going for forty minutes.  I honestly wonder how those who ranted on this thing used them.  I suppose if you crash the head into fencing, brick walls, sidewalks, etc., you will need to change the string.  I know how to trim around the aforementioned, so maybe that's why I'm having great results.  The head went on my universal power unit's shaft in under a minute.  No problem, whatsoever.  I will carry a piece of hanger wire to get the nubs out, should the string break, the next time I get out the unit.  I suppose that a tapered punch or nail set would eventually break the string holders.  I'll update, in here, if this head gives me any trouble.  UPDATE: 8/8/13: I had to replace the unit,  yesterday. The plastic, inset head, that the hex bolt goes into to drive the unit, wore away to the point where the shaft spun and the head didn't. I got a year out of the unit, and for the money, that's fine with me."

779,577,3,"I just recently discovered evidence of mice and decided to give these a try. Never having used any other trap before, I didn't know what to expect. There are no instructions to this - just a couple of drawings that are not at all sufficient. It took me far longer than necessary to figure out how to bait and set them. Despite evidence of activity, it then took several days for one to be set off. In disposing of the trap, I couldn't really be sure a mouse was even in there but didn't want to reopen it to check. I just thew out the entire trap. I did catch one in the second trap and appreciate not having to see the mouse at all. But these are so expensive and not particularly reliable that I would not recommend them to anyone except the most squeamish and wealthy of friends. I have since tried some reusable traps - one that operates like the traditional trap and another that uses a housing like this one - where you don't have to see the mouse but can still empty and reuse the trap itself. Despite my initial reluctance to deal with the sight of a dead mouse, I did catch one in the traditional style trap and it really wasn't as bad as I expected disposing of it. I have yet to catch one in my latest trap (and have not seen other activity) but after trying some other trap varieties, this one would be way down my list of recommendations. There are better and more economical choices."

I am going to put this around the walls where I see them some times (they are usually on the cabinets, and no I do not have food anywhere, they just show up every year), I am not going to put this on the cabinets or anywhere where I have food, but maybe if I can find their path I can stop them.  I will also put some in the corners of the bathrooms (preventative) and in the future if I ever do have a bug problem I will be ready with this.

1382,942,4,"I've gone through a few power washers.  I don't use them often, so I don't get new ones to replace a broken one, just usually I see one and it has a feature I'd like, so I give my old one to a friend or family member, and get the new one.This one looked interesting when it came up in the Vine program, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was winter time when I ordered it, and living in Wisconsin with the winter we've had, I've got so much salt in the garage that I've never seen it look like this before.  In about a 2 foot oval around the entire area the car sits, it's like a small white beach, there are literally small salt dunes in many places.This was probably the biggest pain of any I have purchased to unbox and put together.  There are 19 pieces you pull out, 21 if you count the two wheel covers that were slipped on the wheels but not fully in place yet, and had to be removed to put the wheels on anyway.  Some things didn't line up very easily and required a bit of force to get them into place, and this was mostly due to the barrels the screws went through not going into the holes set in the receiving piece without a bunch of elbow grease and slightly bending things to align them.  There's a little design quality there they could improve upon.I don't like that the connector for the hose is all plastic.  Plastic for the screw threads, plastic for the little rollers that pop out to secure it to the nozzle on the power washer, just plastic plastic plastic.  I've had far too many of these break in the past from other manufacturers. I also don't like the wand's connector.  The hose from the washer to the wand actually slides up inside a deep recessed hole with a cover totally shrouding it.  The hose has to line up a specific way, because of the shape of the plug on it, and there is no marking on the hose to show &#34;line up with this spot&#34; on the wand.  So you have to look into the &#34;tunnel&#34; on the hose to the hole inside, see where the parts are supposed to be lined up, then get the hose oriented this way, and then push it up inside while maintaining that orientation.  Slightly cocking it to one side or the other will mean you won't get it inserted.  So there's some give and take there.  Most places just use round retaining flanges that can be inserted regardless, but this one is rectangular, so it HAS to go in the right way.I was able to do a good stress test of the unit for my first run though, cleaning out that aforementioned garage full of salt and gunk from the winter roads here.  Since we've had an insanely brutal winter compared to normal for the last couple decades, between more snow and more days below zero, we've used a LOT of salt on our roads.  Now that we're in April, and I finally saw a day break 50 degrees, I thought I would finally clean my garage.  Since I didn't even have hoses outside yet, and the faucets outside are still turned off, I bought a short 15 foot hose to run from my wash tub in the laundry room off my garage to the power washer, and just snaked the hose through the garage door and left it open.Once I got past the reset safety on the plug, I saw that it had apparently been shipped in the &#34;on&#34; position.  It's a large 3&#34; or so circle on the BOTTOM of the front of the washer that rotates to turn this on and off.  I like the large oversized swtich, I just don't like the position.  So I got it going, and spent some time working on the concrete floor in my garage.It performed very well, as good as any power washer I've had in the past, and actually better than most.  On/Off with the wand's handle was quick and flawless.  I know my stationary tub does not put out as much water as quickly when compared to the hose bibs outside.  I've had other power washers when, using something with less than &#34;full water&#34; flow like I was using today, would kind of squirt out a little water until you released the handle on the wand, pulled it, released it, and pulled it again, getting enough water pressure to the pump again, and finally the pump would kick in again and it would start actually using power.  I've had that happen here previously using this very stationary tub.  But it never happened once with this unit.  Full power the entire time despite the lesser inflow of water to the unit.Noise levels were about on par with any power washer I've ever owned.  The hose straightened out easily when I &#34;unscrewed&#34; it by twisting the wand to get rid of all the spirals in it from being rolled up, it didn't try to hold it's old &#34;wound&#34; position like many do.  The hose seems to be better than most of the really bad plastic feeling hoses the other washers I've had used.The wand twists to give you control over the size of the spray, and there's a setting for using the detergent mixer as well.  That was another piece of this that just disappointed me as far as the poor engineering.  The instructions show clearly that you are supposed to run the line from the top back of the power washer to the detergent container underneath the handle where this snaps in.  But if you do that, it would kink the unit.  going to the side wasn't a good option either.  I ended up pulling the little line apart and feeding it through one of the other cutouts in the handle, since that way it wasn't compressed and didn't interfere with getting the container on and off.  I've posted a couple pictures of what I'm talking about so you can see what I mean.I also miss the wind up crank my other one had, since there was a hose reel built into the top of it.  But ultimately I prefer this one since as I said, the hose doesn't seem to be forcing itself to stay in a coiled up spiral shape, I can actually get this completely straight and flat while I'm using it.  I find that far more useful than an easy way to roll it up when I'm done.The AC cord has plenty of length, and the hose is a usable length as well.All told, this is a good little unit.  Engineering issues would've made me give this just 3 stars most likely if it performed as adequately as the other power washers I've used in the past, but I had to give it another star for how well it actually worked.  It had no problems stripping the gunk off my concrete floor, or the Weathertech floor mats of my Jeep, or even the floor mats I dragged outside to hose down now that the winter season has mostly passed us up.  If it weren't for how the hose has to line up just the right way without being able to visually see it while you do it for the connector to the wand, or the assembly issues with things not lining up right before you screwed them in, the performance would've earned this 5 stars.  So it balances out to 4, and it's certainly earned all of them."

Although I consider the ingredients organic, I can't imagine the residue would taste good on your squash.One complaint - common with other reviewers - is that the sprayer gives a weak stream.  For my targeted purposes (Squash leaves but not the blossom or squash) it worked out OK, but I could see this being a major pain if you were, for example, spraying down a hydrangea bush or other large plant."

1306,66,3,"It's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short.  Only little birds can land on the legs and they're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder.  It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives."

184,917,5,"I'm mostly an Android user, but I wanted to check this out, so I busted out my iPod Touch to start using my Flower Power.  I'll update this a bit more once the Android app is released (1H14).First off, this is way more than a water/moisture sensor, it's a rather comprehensive tool for understanding your plants, and the included app software takes it even further.  The next thing that becomes apparent is that despite how well thought out it is for a first generation product, it is just that.  Bluetooth is great, but the range is hit or miss, and you need to manually sync things.  Certainly not a deal breaker, but an opportunity for improvement.  The aforementioned Android app is another (though that's as much an issue with Android's Bluuetooth 4.0 support), but the iOS app is rather nice.  The database does make it easy to find your plants, which is what makes this more than a sensor--the analysis that's based on your plant type.Pros:Senses moisture, temperature, light, and fertilizer levelsSpecies based analysisEasy to use appGood battery lifeBluetooth 4.0 (helps with the good battery life)Weatherproof (as you'd expect, but still a positive)Cons:No current Android support (largely an Android issue with Bluetooth 4.0)Spotty Bluetooth range and connectionsMust manually syncA bit pricey for one sensorThis certainly isn't for everyone, though if you're in the market for smart plant sensors (not sure what else is out there), this is a rather well thought out device.  There's room for improvement, but all in all it's pretty darn cool."

778,669,4,"These work great for the garden.  Their size and design make it very easy to cut herbs with.  I've used them for numerous things - to give you an example, azealas and stray boxwood hedges coming up as weeds are easily cut with these.  I put up a clothes line with them, and the twine cutter works just as good on thin rope.I did not find them precise enough for coupons though.  I washed them up, and cut up a whole chicken with them.  While they aren't made for the kitchen, they work great there.  It's really nice that these go through the dishwasher well.Mine have found their final home in the kitchen, but they go get to go outside to cut some herbs and okra now and then.I give them 4 stars because while they are tough and versatile, they are not precise enough for me to cut coupons or fabric for sewing with."

664,104,5,"As you can see, most of these reviews are very old.  I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately.  I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine.  I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box.  It is, afterall, a lightbulb and should be shipped as such, with plenty of pellets."

74,415,4,"Overall I like the design of this Yard Butler hose reel.  It holds plenty of hose &#8211; I have 100 feet on it and there is room to spare.  It reels easily.  No leaking after assembly and use.  Looks attractive.  Feels sturdy.  The handle is high enough to wheel it around without stooping and can be used to push the cart &#8211; like a shopping cart &#8211; rather than dragging it around.Why 4 stars?  The wheels.  My tires came inflated and bulged out of round at the inflated pressure.  They also did not turn freely after being snugged down onto the frame.  In fact, the only way they turned freely was when they were loose enough they could be jiggled a bit on the frame.  I found that a bit odd since the wheels are on hubs that &#8211; I assume &#8211; have bearings.  And only the hubs contact the assembly bolt and cart frame.  Go figure."
1260,637,5,"An Organic Approach To Weed Control!  Definitely A Safer Brand!I have used pre-emergent weed inhibitors for years, usually Preen.  As the father of four kids, I am always hesitant to put down chemicals on our lawn and yard, flower beds, etc. since the kids are often out there on the grass.While Preen is effective, I have never been crazy about adding ""yet another chemical"" to my landscaping.  The active ingredient in Preen is the synthetic herbicide trifluralin. Preen is fairly inexpensive.  Trifluralin is NOT safe for use around vegetables or other food plants/crops.  Also, trifluralin is harmful to fish and marine invertebrates, so if your property has water on it, or drains into ponds, rivers, etc. that is another consideration.So, I recently found out about Concern Weed Prevention Plus by Saferbrand.  Concern is made primarily of corn gluten. There are two versions:  the one being reviewed here, 100% corn gluten, and Plus for Lawn Care, which is corn gluten meal (82%), nitrogen (8%), phosphate (2%) and potash (4%).  These can be used on lawns, around shrubs and flowers, and there are none of the same concerns as when you use trifluralin.  In fact, after using Concern Weed Prevention Plus, your kids can go right out on the lawn. Corn gluten IS safe to use around vegetables and crops. If you do put it on small plants, you want them to be 3 or 4 inches tall, so it doesn't hurt them.Trifluralin and corn gluten provide similar results, by stopping pre-emergent weeds, but they work in different ways.  Trifluralin inhibits cell division.  Corn gluten creates a film layer on soil which impedes weeds from sprouting.  Neither should be used on plants smaller than 3"" or so.The Concern product is a little more expensive than Preen (about 68 cents more per pound, as of this writing), but to me that is a small price to pay for a more organic solution.I used Concern Weed Prevention Plus on my shrub and flower beds this past week.  I checked my soil temperature to ensure it was about 55 degrees, and then applied as directed.  Concern Weed Prevention Plus comes in several sizes.  I use the 5 pound bags.  Although I have enough bedding to require a few bags, I find it more convenient.  Were I to use it on my lawn, I would purchase the larger bags.The 5 pound bag indicates it will cover about 250 square feet.As warmer weather approaches in my area of New Jersey, my friends the dandelions and crabgrass will soon come to visit.  I will update this review to note the effectiveness of the product.Something to keep in mind: NO product eliminates 100% of weeds in the first season, unless you are dealing with a very small area of application.  If you apply periodically, you will control 80-90%, and over a couple of seasons, probably eliminate almost 100% of your weeds.I would rate this product highly, as it provides the same benefits as other chemical solutions, with no real downside."
1267,842,5,"For years I've been using cinnamon to root my plants.  This year, I tried out Garden Safe Rooting Hormone and wow - this stuff works wonders!  While cinnamon works well, I had a higher success rate using the rooting hormone.  You only need a small amount of rooting hormone for it to be effective - this bottle will last quite a long time!  Be sure to keep your new plants well watered!  Highly recommended!"

752,550,3,"I laughed when I opened the Terro 2500 Fruit Fly trap.  The description said it looked like an apple.  It doesn't look like any apple I have every seen.  It is a small bright yellow bit of plastic with odd red and green patches.  I had hoped it would be somewhat cute sitting on my counter.  But it isn't.The trap is very easy to use.  You pull off the ""leaf"" tab (which is unfortunate because it was the cutest thing about the apple.  Then you add the red liquid that was included.  So it takes seconds to set up and is very self explanatory.I chose a rather hard test for the Terro 2500 because this is canning season.  That means lot's of fruit, peelings, juice and seeds.  This also means lots of fruit flies.  There are still fruit flies in my kitchen.  But there are fewer than other years.  I can see lots of them in the trap.  So it is working.  I wonder if I had more traps if they would completely eliminate the flies."
870,251,3,I saw a huge colony of ants on my sidewalk and used this DE to try and get rid of them. The ants crawled through the powder and nothing happened.

Set it, release it, etc so it is second nature.  Even think about putting a cover over it such as an old sheet or pillowcase cut down and cut out around handle and on the cage on the top and both sides - not the ends, when it is baited, so when you walk up and you have caught a tiny something, you won't scare it to death before you get it relocated.  Also helps in case whatever you have inside the trap decides to spray...okay this won't work in the case of skunks :)  You are on your own there........This Havahart 1061 worked great to relocate a family of desert ground squirrels who were in the way of some construction and certain death!"

1223,263,5,"I purchased this unit in February 2012, but just noticed that I forgot to review it. But over 1000 people have already told you how great it is.And I agree. The Toro 51599 is a beast. It's easy to use, and most importantly, it's powerful. It could blow itself out of your hands if you are not careful. It tends to my grass clippings, patio, driveway, and drying of my car with no problem. I have not had a single problem with the unit in the year I've had it. And the metal impeller looks like new.It is loud, and I do find it trying to suck my shirt into the intake every once in a while. But that all points back to the power of the unit.It can get a bit heavy after a long use, but for quick work, the form factor and weight are great.I do wish the unit had a multi-piece output tube, so it could be used with a shorter output. This would make using it for drying the car much more convenient. Instead, I have to buy an additional output tube and cut it down.Lastly, having to be tethered to a cord is a pain, but if you need a powerful blower/vacuum, then you should look no further."

1369,893,5,"My ""yard"" is about a quarter acre, with no lawn, only trees, shrubs and flowers.  The trees are older than 20 years and include multiples of birch, hackberry, Italian cypress, mock orange, crape myrtle, weeping bottlebrush, Callery pear, xylosma, pine, oak, redwood, and last, but not least, manzanita. I have cared for these trees with another heavy-duty lopper with varying degrees of success, so I wanted to try another tool.Because of the price, my initial thought was that these were going to lose a star for that alone.  Then I used them.  Many of the tree types in my yard can be cut fairly easily; however, the pine, oak, redwood and manzanita are extremely hard, especially in thicker branches.  These loppers went through the pine, oak, and redwood branches like a hot knife through butter.  Obviously, loppers have limits because at some point, i.e., thickness, you have to resort to a pruning saw, but when these went through one-inch plus diameter manzanita branches without too much effort, they had me.  Supposedly the loppers will handle up to two inches, so this review will be updated as I try to prune larger branches as well as the item's general wear.Generally in handling the loppers, I especially like the light weight and the shape of the handles being more flattened versus fully round.  If I were to suggest one improvement, it would be to have the handles be telescoping as my older lopper is because I am only 5'3"" tall.  Here is the rest of the story:  I'm 66 and have fibromyalgia.  Using these loppers nonstop for three hours was not anywhere near as difficult or jarring as it was with my old loppers.  As for the cost, they will pay for themselves versus hiring gardening services.Regarding the lifetime warranty, I already know that Fiskars stands behind its products.  I have the Fiskars 9240 Telescoping Pruning Stik, purchased in 2006, and had to contact Fiskars for repairs in 2011.  Customer service is exceptional.  Regarding maintenance, Fiskars recommends that if you do not feel comfortable sharpening your own tools, ask your local gardening center to recommend a professional sharpening service, or call Fiskars' warranty service line at 1-800-500-4849 for more information. Fiskars does not provide sharpening service.  Other care instructions are included on Fiskars' website.September 11, 2013 update:  I did more cutting today, deliberately for 2-inch thick branches; my old lopper could not do this at all, but the Fiskars worked beautifully."

148,873,4,"Just in time for the big Memorial Day pool opening. We have a huge above-ground pool, and we just uncovered it for the summer. It uses a salt system to chlorinate it, and for some reason this seems to keep the walls cleaner than pool chemicals. So we didn't have a lot of film or algae to clean off the walls. What we did have, however, was quickly dealt with using the Orb Enzyme Cleaner Spray. We'll keep a bottle handy now for occasional use. It went a long way."
471,91,5,These things work just fine. I would buy them again. I added to my soil what they said I was low on and I was pleased with the results.
663,895,4,"So I regularly use Miracle-Gro on my plants.  In my opinion there is nothing like the product because it does not burn the plant like dry inorganic fertilizer.  In my case I use the dry Miracle-Gro and mix a pouch in a very large 50 gallon container.  I then can dispense an equal portion of the mix to each plant knowing that each is getting the same formula.  Now with the Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed - it is attached to a hose and is suppose to mix equal portions of liquid and water.  If this is true then fine, however I have found that when you get to near the end of the liquid supply that you don't know if the last to receive the mix are getting an equal portion.  I always had this problem in the past with the dry mix gadgets that Miracle-Gro had in the past, and that's why I went with mixing in a container first and watering with my watering can.  Well if one wanted to use the LiquaFeed gadget and dry (mixed with water) then I suppose this would work, but then you run into the problem of the last run mix as I described.Now for the minus one star - the cost.  I used Amazon Prime figures and Miracle-Gro's per square feet dispensing numbers.  Miracle-gro 10 lb powder on Amazon prime costs about $19.50 and covers 500 x 8 packs or 4000 square feet.  This equates to $.004875 per square foot.  The Miracle-grow 4 pack Liquafeed refill costs around $11.50 on Amazon Prime and covers 400 x 4 bottles or 1600 square feet.  This equates to $.0071875 per square foot.  So the Liquafeed on Amazon costs approximately 1.5 times more.  If you do a lot of fertilizing this could get very expensive very fast.  So the bottom line is that I will stick to the powder and if I use the LiquaFeed gadget then I will mix my own liquid using the dry Miracle-Gro."
1344,481,1,"We had a mouse roaming our basement and I decided to try this thing out.  Always looking for a better mouse trap!  Well, I baited it with some high quality peanut butter and put it to work.  It's been more than two weeks and the thing has done nothing.  Maybe the mouse is too smart for it, but I suspect it's more a case of the better mouse trap just isn't.  Some reviews say it worked for them, but for me it did absolutely nothing."
9,615,3,"I have to say I was excited the day that the Char-Broil Grill2Go ICE Portable Gas Grill arrived.  As someone that travels, goes to games, and various outings, I thought this would be a great option.  While the grill and cooler combo is a good concept, there are some obvious setbacks.  One, as an entire unit, when filled with items in the cooler, it can get fairly heavy.  It has plenty of handles, wheels, and fairly decent support, but it can be a bit to lug around.As for cooking, this grill should get high marks.  The infared technology is an excellent option and it cleans up farely well, as decribed.  The cooking area is also a decent size, given the fact that it is somewhat easy to travel with.  Keep in mind that it is primarly a burger/hotdog/chicken kind of grill.  The height from the grill surface to the top of the limit might limit you as there's just not much height to work with.Now, at this point I would have rated the grill a bit higher, however, I feel that the quality is somewhat lacking.  There are so many plastic pieces and weak joints that I just do not feel that the unit could hold up to several years of moving around, lifting in and out of the car, etc.  I really wish a bit more quality was put into the grill.  Overall, I do like the concept of the product and for the right person this could be the answer to everything they were looking for."
802,587,4,"This spreader is a great size for a garden or small yard. I would not recommend this if you have a very large yard as it would take hours to spread. For my needs, this worked out perfect. It is fairly sturdy, let light-weight and doesn't take up too much room to store.One caveat: Do NOT try to use this spreader for any powdered mixes. This spreader is for pelleted type mixes and probably smaller seeds. For larger items and powders, you will need a drop spreader which this is not."

Certainly not, but it sure makes things prettier and more welcoming!This goes without saying, but please be careful handling after the fire has been burning inside the ring."
1285,343,4,"My tomatoes were about 2' tall when I decided to cage them. I have been using stakes and ties in the past, but a gardening friend recommended that I cage instead. I received my cage via the Amazon Vine program, so it was risk free. I liked it enough that I purchased 3 additional ones for my other plants.Since my plants were already in the ground, I had to assemble the cage around the plants, which worked fine. The packaging on the product, however, was a little intense...there is a lot of plastic to unwrap and many twist ties. It seemed quite excessive. My plants are in deep planters as I'm in the process of reworking my garden space, so I wasn't able to put the ends in as far as they recommend. This makes the cage a good height. I am uncertain if it would be quite tall enough had I been able to insert the stakes as far as they suggested, though. The product material seems very good and I expect to be able to reuse them for at least 5 years.It loses one star for needing more horizontal support clips to be included in the package (I ended up using the twist ties).Caution to anyone who might be interested in ordering as a present: it came shipped box free, so it was clearly evident what it was."

I was worried that it would take a lot of work or coordination to set up, but really, you can set it up and release it with one hand.It also has some great build features - it is sturdy and has both human and animal safety in mind.We haven't caught it yet, but there is also no sign of our little pesky critter yet either."

If you have a need for that application then these could be a good trap. The traps are one time use so while they are convenient, they aren't cheap. It's nice that you don't have to come into contact with the dead mouse since it remains inside the trap. These are designed for small mice, only mice that can fit into the trap are going to get caught unlike baits."
1201,899,5,"Gas-powered leafblowers are powerful, but they're incredibly loud, they spew out a surprising amount of fumes, you have to keep a can of gas-oil mix just for the blower, and engine maintenance is a hassle.  So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100' cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It's lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it's a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.  I own three different GreenWorks tools and have become a huge fan of their system.)"

So far so good..."
283,132,5,"I purchased 6 of these for a backup system for my home. Two Northern units and 4 Sunforce units all 15 watt. ( these are the exact same units btw, northern's are cheaper). With two inverters, a 2500 watt, and a 300 watt pure sinewave for computers and such. Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did, they worked well in very low light but couldn't ever get the batteries to ""full"" on the controller. I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day. With six panels hooked up, it will bring the batteries to ""full"" in a very few hours from a 30% drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun, but do very well even without that. Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to ""full"" but location is a problem for me. One other product of note is the P3 international ""Kill A Watt"" electrical useage meter. Doing a survey of electrical useage in my house to get ready for this project was an eye opener to say the least.Great panels, at a good price, that do what you pay for...all you can ask for."
1428,685,5,"We have 2 of these and they are definitely one of the easiest timers of any sort to set up and use. One large dial allows you to select the mode to set the clock, set on time, set how long you want the water to flow, and determine how often you want this to occur. This allows quite a lot of flexibility in watering. Two buttons market (+) and (-) allow you to set how long the valve will be open. That's it. Turn the dial to AUTO and you're done.The manual override is a 3rd button that allows you to run water too without adjusting the dial. The default manual setting is 10 minutes, but this can be adjusted up or down using the (+) or (-) buttons.Nice product, with a well thought out design (or ""user-interface"", in modern parlance) that does the job well."

729,810,3,"I have both the liquid and solid versions of this repellent.  I am using both for different areas of my yard. The solid one is being use in the ground entrance which is a tunnel type opening for the gopher that has been treating my vegetable garden like its own all-you-can-eat salad buffet.  This liquid version is being used for its second entrance to my yard in the hole it dug for itself in my stone wall.  The wall is really old and is made of field stones over the past 100 years or more and so it's hard to put repellent in the nooks and crannies. The gopher has already destroyed part of this wall when it moved its original 2nd entrance a few feet.  By being able to spray a larger area, I am hoping to prevent it from moving the exit/entrance to its den along my stone wall and in the process destroying the wall itself.So far, for the past 3 weeks, I have not seen any sign of activity along that wall.I will report back if anything changes for better or for worse.  I had previously used cayenne pepper which worked well for the plants themselves but was however tricky to apply to the stone wall."
1047,366,5,Well built and guess what....there's definitely no spill.  I would buy more if the price wasn't so expensive.  I do recommend this gas container.
411,765,5,"After using a friend's electric tiller I decided I needed one. I originally bought aTroy-Bilt TB154E 9-Inch 6.5-Amp Electric Garden Cultivator/Tiller, but it gave up the ghost 8 days after I had it.  Upon returning it to the store I was told ""try the Black and Decker.""  So I ordered this unit from Amazon and I'm VERY glad I did.  This machine is only $50 more than the Troy-Bilt but is much more powerful and much more versatile, too.  It's also more powerful and more versatile than the Mantis I'd borrowed from my friend. With its 8.3 amps and very high high torque, this Black & Decker unit hardly seems like it's straining.Some things I like:- The unit can operate on any blade combination.  Multiple hitch pin holes in the axle allow you to use just one blade or two blades on one side, or one blade on each side, or all four blades.- You can position the blades in or out;  Both in / both out / one out - one in on each side ... your choice.- You can operate the unit with extra weight using dry sand in the top container, or use it in what I call lightweight mode by leaving the container empty or just lifting it out when you want to use it in lightweight mode.  How much sand (weight) you use is up to you.  It's easier to get good depth using the extra weight but takes a bit more muscle to handle the machine. Personally, I use the extra weight to quickly get the depth and then remove the container and go over the area again in lightweight mode to level things off.- Hitch pins allow the blades to be removed quickly and easily for cleaning.- The handle can be quickly loosened and folded over for easy transport in a trunk, back seat, or the back of a hatchback.I do wish the wheels were more adjustable (there are only 3 settings), but if that's my only gripe, I really have nothing to complain about.In addition to using it in the garden I also used it to tear up a patch of thin grass so I could lay down sod.  Wow-- It made that job very quick and easy, too.Thanks Black & Decker for making a reliable, versatile product that can handle the job!"
1313,627,4,"I love the compactness of this. It has an ant moat which is fine for the crawlers, but the fliers (flying ants and fruit files) still get in there - probably an issue for all hummingbird feeders.  I love that it attaches to the window so I can see the one hummingbird that comes to feed at it, however, the fruit flies are finding their way into my house.  I might have to trade this in for a hanging one that I can put further from the house."
1585,792,5,"We live in a lake region so no obvious need to provide water for birds. However we do have a few feeders and thought we could add this to the mix. This waterer is sturdy and easy to fill. The loop at the top was perfect for a mini-carabiner to hang from a hook. Small birds (chickadees, finches) have taken to it. It is already popular and it took no time for the small birds to get used to it. Easy to clean and a breeze to refill.Given out water rich environment I'd probably not buy another but if I was in a dryer area a few of these would be great for backyard birders. I've not seen any of our larger songbirds at the waterer so I'd say expect smaller birds."
1385,588,5,"I've never had or used a pressure washer before. Reading the many comments here on Amazon.com I learned of the many potential uses it would have at my home. I am not disappointed. It works great.The AR383 arrived yesterday. I used it on a Trex deck on the side of our house today. We've had the deck for three and a half years and only washed it with a hose from time to time. It is subject to dust blowing from nearby farm fields, from residue dropping from airplanes landing at two local airports, and a lot of wind carried debris. I knew if I ever tried to tackle cleaning the Trex with a scrub brush it would not produce good results. From the first few inches of cleaning I knew I had made a good purchase. A dark layer of dirt came off exposing a long lost clean color of the deck. The deck has 6 stairs on each end, is about 6' wide and about 30' long. It took me about two hours to do the whole thing. I also used the pressure washer to wash the dirt off the white painted wooden fence along the side of the deck which came out really nice.AR North America must have gotten the message about the leaking hose fitting. They didn't ship the fitting in the manual. I had already purchased the brass fitting replacement but didn't need to use it. The new hose fitting is a two part quick release connection that didn't leak a drop.I found I could wrap the hose around the hose reel as designed. I read where several people thought it wouldn't work but it worked fine for me. The power cord wraps around the back side but it was just a bit too much cord for the way the AR383 is designed and the last few turns were outside the holding bracket.This isn't a tool that I would grab and use for a small job without knowing that the time to set it up and put it away is at least 5 to 10 minutes on each end of the job. But my imagination was running wild with all the jobs I could do with it.The machine doesn't make too much noise, and the cord and high pressure hose are long enough for all applications around my house. I appreciate that the pump shuts off quickly after releasing the handle. I do wish the handle had a lock to keep it on so I wouldn't have to hold it on all the time. My hand is tired after cleaning the deck.I have nothing to compare this with but I like it a lot and highly recommend it. Time will tell about reliability."
1212,906,4,"I was hoping to get a few car washes in with this hose in the time that I owned it, but Mother Nature did not cooperate.  The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &#8220;good&#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!  Fighting with stiff hoses that bunch up and kink every time tension is put on them will be a thing of the past!"
1664,39,5,"This nozzle really fits the bill with good spray patterns that work well, good water pressure and good ease of use.  Because it's plastic, I'll have to take it in for the winter lest it leak next season, but so far it doesn't leak at all.  Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower pressure overall, as I do.The gentle shower pattern, a favorite for me, works really nicely with a nice overall spray and decent enough pressure to water the back of my 8' deep garden as effectively as the front.  The jet is great.  The pattern ring doesn't turn quite as easily as my Toro nozzle, nor is the trigger quite as easy to squeeze, but both are quite doable even with arthritis in my hands and the lock is easy to flip into place so you don't have to squeeze the trigger for long periods.  The patterns are so much more effective than the more expensive red and silver Toro, I'm definitely replacing others with this one when needed.  I'll leave the Toro on in the winter, because if it cracks and leaks, I won't really care.  This is a great nozzle that meets a lot of needs from vegetable gardens to potted plants."
1198,779,2,"I was able to obtain this item for review through the Amazon Vine program.  I have a garden hose that must reside rather near my front door, and had been looking for a hose holder that was nice looking, and did not weigh a ton.  I thought that this item fit the bill nicely.Pros:The hose holder is nice looking, having an embossed pattern in the metal, and being colored an attractive verdigris green.It is lightweight, and therefore easily moved.It can indeed hold at least a 100-foot 5/8 hose(see photo).The central post can be removed in order to use it for something other than a hose holder.I did not have to order the lid separately, as it came with the lid.Cons:The lid showed rust in just two days, simply from sitting outside overnight in cool damp weather. It was not exposed to sprinklers or rain within that time span.  The fact that it started to rust that fast causes me some concern over its long-term durability.Looks like I will have to clean off the rust and coat it with polyurethane or other similar clear coating in order to have it remain good-looking for any length of time, and to avoid rust stains on my concrete.Disappointed.  The listed price at this time is $94.58. For that much money I would expect better quality.  If I had paid for this item, I would be sending it back."
235,67,4,"I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick."
1202,411,5,"I got suckered into buying a fancy plastic hose nozzle.  It sprayed water heavily out the sides the first time I tried it.  I even almost ruined my hose by trying to use tools and leverage in an effort tighten the plastic nozzle to the extreme.  Finally, I got this beautiful little brass nozzle.This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.  The thing works great.  When it's shut off, you'd never know the water is still ""on.""  Just beautiful - I love it."
662,288,3,I bought these suet cakes for winter feeding.  A few of the songbirds will feed on it but the woodpeckers don't seem to care for it. The deer love it.
766,475,5,You just have to clean the window good and then put the suction cups up where you want the hanger.  I left mine  hang without anything on it for a couple of days.  It anchored well and I will put one of the Hummingbird feeders on it. Great way to watch the little guys eat right through the window.
1540,66,3,"It's sturdy, a plus. It's engineered to keep squirrels from damaging it and eating the feed. That works too. It's attractive, another plus. Add that up and you get about 2 and a half stars.BUT...BUT...BUT...The design is not only unfriendly to the squirrels, but it is alsoBIRD UNFRIENDLY.I waited a long time, several weeks to review watching the feeder just off my patio where hangs several other feeders. During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It's almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don't want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it's called a bird feeder and the birds don't like the design, then that's a giant multi-star negative. I can't recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer. I'm listening to the golden finches and chickadees who said ""No."""
488,99,5,"Great product!!  Works great. I have trimmed many hedges with this little machine, and it holds it's charge throughout the job. Not too heavy, and easy to maneuver. Very pleased I bought it."
1647,251,5,"For years, I usedSENORET CHEMICAL 300 ""TERRO"" LIQUID ANT BAITS BX6.  It worked extremely well.  Within 12 hours, all ants were gone.  However, my latest infestation was not responding to Terro, in fact, they were eating the liquid up, but it wasn't killing the ants.  My neighborhood Hardware Supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides.  I found the ""Safer"" product, but was skeptical.  Take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through.  For me, it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen.  Then I swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder.  It worked instantly.  Any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die.  I have a cat, so I cleaned any excess up carefully, so she cannot get any on her paws, as it is very toxic.  It's as good as Boric Acid.This powder claims to kills Ants, Cockroaches, Earwigs, Silverfish, Crickets, Millipedes and Centipedes.  I did notice that immediately after applying this product, Silverfish started to appear, evidently sensing the chemicals.  Soon, they will be gone.  Do check it out.  I am SO glad to be rid of those ants (they even got into my freezer where I had chocolate!)."
672,246,5,"I got one of these to replace a &#34;plastic&#34; one that had became unusable.I have found that Gilmour product are very well made and usually last a lot longer that a plastic item.I ended up getting two of these, of for the front and one for the back yards. now I don't have to disconnect a drip system for the flower beds to attach a hose."
193,31,5,"That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years."
1109,857,5,"I used this kit to tune up my Honda Power washer. Everything was there including a small bucket to drain the old oil into. The spark plug, air filter and oil was there to change and it might have taken me 15 minutes to do. Thats a good thing. I will consider buying these for my lawnmower and generator. Recommended"
1496,840,4,"I was a little worried when my chaise arrived because all four legs had worked their way through the box.  The delivery guy helped me unpack and inspect it, and thankfully, there was no damage.  It comes completely assembled, except for removing the plastic cover from the cushion and placing in on.  The back rest is easy to adjust and has 4 height settings or can be left down altogether.  I'm 5'5"" and it's the perfect size for me.  The cushion is soft and thick and very comfortable.  It's covered with  a polyester fabric that resembles cotton twill.  The chaise looks great and is very sturdy.  I think we're going to order another one."
519,167,4,"What these products are is a deterrent. That means it hopefully keeps many of your local population at bay to protect your trees, plants, veggies, etc. These sprays are best used with other methods like chicken wire, etc. You also have to realize that you will still lose some stuff to these little critters but the idea is to limit that loss.In that case, I think Deer Off II works as well as any other critter off spray I have tried. These are best reapplied every 45-60 days (regardless of what they advertise since that is a ""up to"" day count). The spray didn't seem any better than past products but I did appreciate the fact that you don't have to mix it or hurt your thumb spraying due to the battery powered sprayer.I would recommend this product."
166,104,4,"The advantages of grow lights are obvious, so I won't summarize them here.  I will mention that the sign on the produce advising that it is for use only in dry environments was surprising.  Surely a product intended to be used in raising plants is by definition going to be used in a somewhat humid environment.  That aside, it's a good little unit, easy to assemble and fairly easy to disassemble later.  I'm not sorry to own one."
273,686,5,I really love that this pot is a lot longer than the ones I have previously owned in this shape.  It makes more room for more flowers or veggies...just what I wanted.
146,790,4,"I think any experienced bird feeding hobbyist could take one look at this feeder and realize it is not squirrel proof, so I'm really not rating it on that aspect.  The cap on which the squirrel-proof claim rests has so far kept squirrels from going in through the top, but only because it's easy enough to access the seed from the feeding ports that they haven't bothered to try lifting the lid.  They can only get a little bit at a time, but my squirrels are oh-so patient and are content taking as long as necessary to empty a feeder.However, I have a more accessible hopper style feeder nearby of which the squirrels are big fans, so I am able to use this one with a fair amount of success.  The birds really do seem to like the U-shaped perches better than the straight perches on my actually squirrel-proof feeders (Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plusand Brome's similar peanut feeder), and this feeder is hands-down more attractive.  For twenty bucks it is not, of course, actually made of antique copper, but it does give the appearance and is a pretty yard decoration.  Time will tell whether the copper finish will age nicely, and I have low expectations for the plastic windows which, in my experience, take about one season to become scratched and cloudy.  For now, though, I am enjoying this feeder a lot and the price is reasonable enough that it won't break my heart if it doesn't hold its looks for multiple seasons.  It is sturdy and I expect it will continue to work, so I'll just move it to a less visible spot in the yard if that happens."
715,612,5,"I have a lot of windows and a few sliding doors as well. One of the doors was really dirty from the winter weather and I thought that was be an especially good test of this window vac and it was. First I cleaned the inside of the sliding doors - you just spray your window cleaner on the window - I started from the top down - and then you turn the Karcher Window Vac on and squeegee your window cleaner off and your window clean.I didn't think it would work that well, and wondered if I'd still need to use some paper towels.  It worked really well. Cleaned the door well, and even the really dirty side cleaned up beautifully.  It worked as well on my windows. It's not very heavy to hold and clean up was easier then I expected too. Just pull off and wash the blade, then open the reservoir tank discharge plug and pour the dirty water out - then you pour clean water in the open top (the blade is off) and keep pouring water through until it's clean. Only took a minute or two.Their were no drips or streaks on the window and I did a lot of cleaning with no paper towels. Recommended!"
956,589,5,"I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004.  It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle.  That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down.  Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass!  I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and ""upgraded"" to the MM1800, the 18"" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker.  Immediately I was dissatisfied.  It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver.  Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick.I decided to try to leave the Black and Decker world and see what else I could find.Bear in mind, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard.  I did not want cordless battery power because I didn't want to have to keep batteries alive (some require charge/discharge cycles all winter) or buy new batteries.Corded lawn mowers are a fine solution.  Many complain about ""cord management"", but here's the trick.  Your lawn never changes.  Unless you are a professional landscaper (and if you are, buy a gas mower), then you always mow the same lawn.  So the trick is to come up with a mowing pattern where you mow away from the outlet and never trip over the cord.  Once you have a pattern, stick with it and you can mow quickly.Which brings me to the Greenworks 25022 20"" electric bag/mulch/side discharge mower.  It costs a bit more than the Black and Decker, but what a difference.  First, the deck of the mower is metal, not plastic!  That means it is thinner than the B&D.;  Also, with more metal the top is not covered in bulky plastic.  I have a sewer cleanout stand-pipe in my yard.  My Black and Decker MM1800 could never mow close to it so I always had to get out the weed whacker.  I was amazed that the Greenworks 25022 could mow so close that there was no need to come back for cleanup.  I did it all in 1 pass.The amazing thing is that the mower is 20"" instead of the 18"" of the B&D;, meaning I could mow my lawn faster with fewer passes, yet it could also get closer to things due to the smaller shroud over the blade.Other nice features include very large rear tires, what might be the largest in the industry.  They make it far easier to maneuver than models with 7"" or 8"" wheels.  Cord management is a snap with a nice pig-tail cord that secures nicely.  The B&D; model didn't have a pigtail, just a plug on the device itself, and the cord was harder to keep in.This mower also permits side-discharge.  I normally just mulch, but it is nice to have that as an option in addition to bagging.The mower activates with a simple bar that has a 1-button safety.  The safety is easy enough to use to not be obtrusive and the bar is full length so you can grab it from either side.The height adjustment of this mower is far higher quality than the B&D; height adjust.  Strong metal controls with positive stops made height adjustment a snap.For the space limited, the handle folds very easily.  The middle bar doesn't even need to be unscrewed as there are folding posts to ""snap"" it into place, and the screws on the bottom are retained in the unit when it folds so there are no parts to lose.I am a happy convert from Black and Decker, and recommend you give this mower a try!Update from November 2011:When I first reviewed the mower, I commented that I was just mulching.  This weekend I gave the bagging feature a try because I wanted to mow up the leaves all of my yard.  If you mulch those you just make a mess, so I needed to bag.  The bag installed easily - just lift the spring-loaded back door, remove the mulching plug, and the bag has 2 hooked to secure it.  The bag filled up quickly which was to be expected given the large number of leaves I was mowing, but it was easy to empty.  One thing I quickly noticed - the bag is narrow enough to fit between the handlebars.  As a result, I could pick it straight up without bending over and pulling all the way back.  I spilled less clippings and got it emptied far faster.  The bag is obviously well thought out and rounds out a great tool that I recommend with no reservations.Update from Spring 2013:The mower is still going strong.  Just another note - I abuse this thing.  I leave it chained under my deck all year long since I don't have a garage or a tool shed.  It sits in the rain, the snow, the heat, and the cold.  Amazingly, every spring I plug it in, squeeze the handle, and it starts right up.  Can't say that for even lots of gas mowers.  Still gets my recommendation!Update from Spring 2014:I tried a Black and Decker mower this year that was battery operated.  It lasted 2 weeks and died when the blade hit a root and bent 90 degrees.  I went back over to my Greenworks 25022.  It's started to rust a bit (yes, I still keep it outside), but I plugged it in and cut my lawn in a snap.  Still a happy customer!"
1451,692,4,"I first started thinking about this 19"" Black & Decker lawn mower last fall after I took it for a test drive at my brother in law's house. I finally ordered it last December via Amazon when the price significantly dropped and B&D; offered an additional instant rebate. For under $300 bucks it was and still is quite a bargain. After eight months use, these are my thoughts.Not surprisingly, the lawn mower arrived at my doorstep in its original tattered box. Actual parts of the lawn mower were poking out on all sides. The only thing holding the box together was massive amounts of shipping tape wrapped continuously around the box. Speaking from long term experience on this issue, when it comes to proper packaging and the shipping of large merchandise its still hit and miss with Amazon. Mostly miss. It didn't take me long to realize that complaining to Amazon falls on deaf ears. The only message they understand is immediate refund because of poor packaging.The real miracle is that after an inventory of parts and a point to point inspection all was well. Not even a bolt missing or a bent part to contend with. So I kept this mower. The instructions are pretty much cut and dry. Assembly was quick and simple. This mower is certainly no lite weight at 90 lbs. The battery alone is almost 30 lbs. The manufacturer recommends charging the battery for 12 hours prior to operating. I had a full charge in three hours. I like the battery's built in power indicator. With just a push of the button, I get a reading of how much juice is left.Now the test. After locking the battery in place it was all systems go. Powering up requires pulling the power handle and pushing the start button simultaneously. It also requires a safety key. If the key is not in power is zilch. I like the cutting height level switch. All it takes is a squeeze. I have the option to mulch or bag with just a simple twist of the setting knob located on the carriage. At first the knob was a sticky. After a few times, its worked itself out. The folding handle is adjustable and offers just the right height for me.Besides the low noise level, I like the fact that there is zero vibration. I certainly don't miss the smell of gas. Unlike my older mowers, rust is definitely not going to be an issue. The wheels are sturdy and a bit wider then my Honda. The mulch features work as advertised. Bagging is another story. Like every other mower I have owned, the bag could be bigger. Also I noticed that when in bag mode, the chute easily clogs. This is definitely a design flaw. The overdrive on this mower is sweet. With multi-levels of drive, this puppy does take off. This feature alone may take some getting use to. I know the overall speed surprised the heck out of me.Power wise, I have enough juice to mow both my large front and back yards. For me that was a welcome surprise. Installing and removing the battery is quite simple. Its just a flip of the protective lever. Removing the battery is just an option. It can remain on the carriage and be charged via the safety key receptacle. Just remember to store the key in a safe, easy to find location. Personally, I attached the safety key to a long, colorful key tag. It hasn't happened yet, but if it ever falls out of the slot I'm sure to find it.Like any tool proper maintenance is essential. I always do a quick inspection prior to use. After mowing I use my blower to remove any debris.  Don't even think about the water hose. For me, I sharpen the blade at least once every six months. Depending on individual use, it may require more often. I also picked up a back up blade. With a schedule of weekly mowing, I haven't noticed any significant drop off in battery power. Warranty wise, the manufacturer tacks on a two year warranty for both the mower and the battery.Overall, I don't miss the maintenance, noise or smell of my gas powered mowers at all. Even with the problem with the small grass chute this Black & Decker self propelled mower has proved itself time and time again. Its been a workhorse for me. I would definitely buy it again."
