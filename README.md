## Preparatory Codes

* **params.py** - The values for various parameters/hyperparameters can be modified in this file.
* **paths_args.py** - The paths (e.g. path of the dataset) can also be adjusted here.
* **general_codes.py** - Has the function bodies for the training and evaluation phases.
* **recsys_lib20.py** - Contains the functions for obtaining the extractive summary embeddings, the actual collaborative filtering, and other utilities.

## Main Codes

* **[0] Prepare ExSumm Emb.ipynb** - Run this notebook to obtain and save extractive summary embeddings.
* **[1] Run AceCF (Train-Pred).ipynb** - Run this notebook to train and evaluate AceCF.
